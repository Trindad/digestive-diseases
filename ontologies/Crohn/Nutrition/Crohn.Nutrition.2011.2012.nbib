TI  - Nutrition in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it useful for prevention
      and therapy?
PG  - 983-90
AB  - Countless studies aiming to discover the cause and cure of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) have been conducted over the years world-wide. Food nutrients were 
      believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction
      with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal
      microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with
      controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has
      to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication
      can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent
      long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in
      preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of
      enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease,
      according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of
      administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on
      parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.

AB  - Patient diagnosed with Crohn's Disease with inflammatory pattern that evolves
      stenosing-piercing, causing abdominal perforation and fecal peritonitis. She was 
      underwent to three surgeries, leading to numerous complications and a torpid
      clinical course. Given the state of malnutrition on admission it was prescribed
      Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), extending the administration for more than 10
      months. In this period the TPN is suspended for 5 days, but the persistence of an
      enterocutaneous fistula causes the restoration of the TPN. After clinical
      stabilization, the patient is discharged to recover her nutritional status
      necessary to perform a bowel reconstruction surgery, continuing with TPN at home.
      After 7 and a half months, the patient with an optimal nutritional status,
      undergoes surgery, evolving favorably and suspending the TPN at 9 days.

TI  - Safety and cost of infliximab for the treatment of Belgian pediatric patients
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - Biologicals have become an important component in the treatment of Crohn's
      disease in children. Their increased and long term use raises safety concerns. We
      describe safety and cost of infliximab in Belgian pediatric Crohn's disease
      patients. All patients on infliximab as part of the present or past treatment for
      Crohn's Disease until January 1st 2011 were selected from an existing database.
      Information on disease phenotype, medication and adverse events were extracted.
      Adverse events occurred in 25.9% of patients exposed to infliximab of which 29.6%
      were severe. In total 31.7% of patients stopped infliximab therapy. The main
      reasons for discontinuation were adverse events in 45.4% and loss of response in 
      30.3%. No malignancies or lethal complications occurred over this 241 patient
      year observation period. Immunomodulators were concomitant medication in 75% of
      patients and were discontinued subsequently in 38.4% of them. The cost of
      infliximab infusions per treated patient per year in the Belgian health care
      setting is approximately 9 474 euro, including only medication and hospital
      related costs. Even though infliximab is relatively safe in pediatric CD on the
      short term, close follow-up and an increased awareness of the possible adverse
      reactions is highly recommended. Adverse reactions appeared in 25.9% of all
      patients and were the main reason for discontinuation. Treatment cost has to be
      balanced against efficacy and modifications in disease course. In the Belgian
      health care system, the medication is available to all patients with moderate to 
      severe CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) is an increasingly recognized
      problem in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical
      pattern in children and adolescents with CD seen at King Abdulaziz University
      Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective
      hospital-based study conducted on data collected for the period between January
      2001 and March 2010. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for all children and adolescents 
      diagnosed at KAUH with CD in the period were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS:
      Ninety-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 11.3 years
      (range, 0.12-17.6 years). Fifty (52.1%) were males. Sixty-four (66.7%) were
      Saudis. Nine (9.4%) had a first degree relative with inflammatory bowel disease. 
      The most common presenting symptoms were diarrhea (88.5%), weight loss (84.2%)
      and anorexia (80.2%). At least one extraintestinal manifestation occurred in 24% 
      of patients. Forty-two percent were underweight and 19% had short stature. The
      most common distribution was ileocolonic (37.5%), followed by colonic in 31.2%.
      Twenty-five (26%) patients had perianal disease, 13 (13.5%) had strictures and 15
      (15.6%) had penetrating disease. Laboratory investigations revealed anemia in
      84.4%, thrombocytosis in 50%, hypoalbuminemia in 64.6%, elevated erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) in 50% and elevated C-reactive protein in 58.3%.
      Induction of remission was achieved with enteral nutrition in 20% of patients and
      with corticosteroids in the remaining. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical pattern of CD in
      children from the Western Province of Saudi Arabia was found to be similar to
      reports from the West. Pediatricians should be aware of the varying presentations
      of CD. Early referral to specialized centers is crucial.

TI  - Epigenetics and the developmental origins of inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 909-15
AB  - The gut microbiota, the intestinal mucosa and the host immune system are among
      the large biological networks involved in the development of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), which includes Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Host genetics and environmental factors can significantly modulate the
      interactive relationships among these biological systems and influence
      predilection toward IBD. High monozygotic twin discordance rates and the rapid
      rise in the prevalence of IBD indicate that environmental influences may be as
      important or even more important in their pathogenesis than genetic
      susceptibility. However, the nature and timing of environmental factors critical 
      for inducing IBD remain largely unknown. The molecular mechanisms and the key
      biological component(s) that may be affected by such factors are also in
      question. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (the methylation of
      cytosines followed by a guanine in CpG dinucleotides) can be modified by
      environmental influences during finite developmental periods and have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Mucosal DNA methylation can also react to 
      changes in the commensal microbiota, underscoring the intercalating relationships
      among the large biological systems involved in gastrointestinal disorders.
      Therefore, transient environmental influences during specific periods of
      development may induce critical change(s) in an isolated or concomitant fashion
      within the intestinal biomic networks and lead to increased susceptibility to
      IBD. The present review focuses on the emerging paradigm shift considering IBD to
      originate from critical environmental effects during pre- and postnatal
      development.

TI  - The influence of deficiencies of essential trace elements and vitamins on the
      course of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - In patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is
      an important complication, frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies,
      especially vitamins (both water- and fat-soluble) and essential trace elements.
      It is often a result of the disease activity, poor oral intake and/or restrictive
      diets. Nutrition plays an important role in disease management and helps to
      maintain remission in CD patients. Deficiencies occur in patients with active
      Crohn's disease, and also in those in remission. Specific supplementation of
      vitamins and micro- and macronutrients might be helpful or even necessary in this
      group of patients. This review outlines the most frequent nutritional
      deficiencies and their complications in relation to the Crohn's Disease Activity 
      Index, and provides an overview of therapeutic perspectives for CD patients in
      adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biological therapy, which
      is being used with increasing frequency, seems not only to mitigate the
      inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract, but also has significant
      impact on the nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that
      primarily affects the intestines, resulting in breakage of the intestinal
      barrier, pathological inflammation and nutritional disorders that encompass from 
      trace elements deficiency to severe malnutrition. Nutritional interventions
      either alone or associated to drug therapy may be effective to achieve and
      maintain inflammation remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual food intake as
      quantitative and qualitatively, in CD patients; and describe the effect of a
      supplement containing whey proteins and TGF- on their body composition. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed considering 42 consecutive patients,
      followed in a tertiary center, and by using the 3-day food recall and food intake
      frequency questionnaire. Body composition was assessed previously and 8 weeks
      after supplementation with a diet containing whey proteins and TGF-beta (N = 22).
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Considering carbohydrates and lipids, most patients had
      adequate dietary intake according recommendations. Protein, saturated fat, B12
      vitamin and zinc intakes were higher than the recommended values. The dietary
      fiber, A, D, C and E vitamins, calcium, iron, folate, potassium and sodium
      intakes did not reach the recommended requirements in most patients. Patients
      supplemented with the whey protein and TGF-beta dietary presented a positive
      increment in their lean body mass, when compared to non-supplemented group.
      CONCLUSION: CD patients require nutritional orientation. Whey protein intake
      resulted in significant differences, such as improvement in Lean Body Mass and
      reduction in Fat percentage.

AB  - Primary duodenal localization of Crohn's disease (CD) is rare. Medical therapy
      can control symptoms, but surgery is required when progressive obstructive
      symptoms occur. Surgical options include bypass, resection, or strictureplasty,
      but it is still not clear which should be the treatment of choice. Reviewing the 
      medical records of 1253 patients undergoing surgery for CD between January 1986
      and December 2011 at the Digestive Surgery Unit of the Department of Clinical
      Physiopathology of the University of Florence, 10 patients (6 males and 4
      females) underwent operations for duodenal CD. Four patients had only a duodenal 
      localization, 6 patients had synchronous involvement of other intestinal tracts. 
      Strictures were distributed in all the duodenal portions: in 7 patients there
      were single lesions, in 3 patients there were multiple lesions. Eight patients
      were treated with strictureplasty: 5 with the Heineke-Mikulicz technique, 2 with 
      Jaboulay, and 1 with a pedunculated jejunal patch. Two patients were treated with
      resection: one with a B2 gastro-duodenal resection, and 1 with a duodenal-jejunal
      resection and an end to side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis. Follow up of the
      patients was from 2 to 18 years. No recurrence of duodenal CD was observed in the
      2 patients treated with resection, while 2 of the 8 patients treated with
      strictureplasty had a recurrence. In our experience, strictureplasty is indicated
      when less than 2 strictures are present in the 2nd or 3rd duodenal portion. In
      cases with multiple strictures localized in the 1st or the distal duodenal
      portion, resection is preferable.

PG  - 5862-9
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i41.5862 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years,
      including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of
      the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, 
      and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number
      of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life,
      including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of
      paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in
      children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include 
      isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal
      manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly
      compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of
      possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure
      prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns
      of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ
      substantially from adult-onset disease. Various treatment options are available
      for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a
      central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and
      surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and
      developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children 
      should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control 
      of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst
      preventing disease or treatment-related complications.

TI  - Selenium, selenoprotein genes and Crohn's disease in a case-control population
      from Auckland, New Zealand.
PG  - 1247-59
LID - 10.3390/nu4091247 [doi]
AB  - New Zealand has one of the highest incidence rates of Crohn's Disease (CD),
      whilst the serum selenium status of New Zealanders is amongst the lowest in the
      world. A prospective case-control study in Auckland, New Zealand considered serum
      selenium as a potential CD risk factor. Serum selenium levels were significantly 
      lower in CD patients compared to controls (101.8 +/- 1.02 vs. 111.1 +/- 1.01
      ng/mL) (p = 5.91 x 10(-8)). Recent detailed studies in the United Kingdom have
      suggested an optimal serum level around 122 ng/mL, making the average CD patient 
      in New Zealand selenium deficient. Of the 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) tested, 13 were found to significantly interact with serum selenium on CD.
      After adjustment for multiple testing, a significant interaction with serum
      selenium on CD was found for three SNPs, namely rs17529609 and rs7901303 in the
      gene SEPHS1, and rs1553153 in the gene SEPSECS. These three SNPs have not been
      reported elsewhere as being significantly associated with selenium or CD. It is
      unclear as to whether lower selenium levels are a cause or an effect of the
      disease.

PG  - 31-72
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0673-1 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a disorder of unknown etiology and complicated pathogenesis. A
      substantial amount of evidence has accumulated recently and has been applied to
      clinical practice. The present guidelines were developed based on recent evidence
      and the formal consensus of experts relevant to this disease. Here we provide an 
      overview of these guidelines, as follows. Target disease: Crohn's disease Users: 
      Clinical practitioners in internal medicine, surgery, gastroenterology, and
      general practice Purpose: To provide appropriate clinical indicators to
      practitioners Scope of clinical indicators: Concept of Crohn's disease,
      epidemiology, classifications, diagnosis, treatment, follow up, and special
      situations Intervention: Diagnosis (interview, physical examination, clinical
      laboratory tests, imaging, and pathology) and treatment (lifestyle guidance, drug
      therapy, nutritional therapy, surgery, etc.) Outcome assessment: Attenuation of
      symptoms, induction and maintenance of remission, imaging findings, quality of
      life (QOL), prevention of complications and harm of therapy Methods for
      developing these guidelines: Described in the text Basis of recommendations:
      Integration of evidence level and consensus of experts Cost-benefit analysis: Not
      implemented Evaluation of effectiveness: Yet to be confirmed Status of
      guidelines: Updated version of the first Guidelines published in 2010 Publication
      sources: Printed publication available and electronic information in preparation 
      Patient information: Not available Date of publication: October 2011 These
      guidelines were intended primarily to be used by practitioners in Japan, and the 
      goal of these guidelines is to improve the outcomes of patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Value of concomitant endoscopic balloon dilation for intestinal stricture during 
      long-term infliximab therapy in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 432-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1443-1661.2012.01315.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: We assessed the long-term outcome of infliximab (IFX) therapy in patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD) and investigated the efficacy of concomitant endoscopic
      balloon dilation (EBD) for intestinal stricture during treatment. METHODS: The
      effectiveness of maintenance therapy with IFX was retrospectively evaluated in
      185 patients with CD in a single center (median observation period 24 months).
      IFX effectiveness with and without immunomodulators (IMM) and enteral nutrition
      (EN), as well as cumulative surgery-free rates, were compared. The efficacy of
      concomitant EBD in patients with obstructive symptoms and high-level stricture
      was evaluated. RESULTS: In 185 patients receiving the maintenance therapy, the
      long-term efficacy rate was 84.9% at 24 months and 79.0% at 48 months. The
      cumulative surgery-free rate was significantly higher in the maintenance group (P
      < 0.001). Concomitant IMM and EN did not significantly affect the effectiveness
      of IFX. IFX was discontinued in only 18 cases (7.3%). Symptomatic high-level
      stricture occurred in 33 patients (17.8%) in the maintenance group and the
      cumulative surgery-free rate was significantly higher in the EBD combination
      compared with the non-EBD group (P < 0.05). If EBD were considered invasive
      intervention, the actual cumulative surgery rate in the maintenance group was
      significantly lower compared with the cumulative invasive intervention rate (P < 
      0.001). CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with IFX is highly effective. The
      surgery-free rate was clearly higher in the maintenance group. Only concomitant
      EBD for intestinal stricture helped in the avoidance of surgery.

TI  - Efficacy of erythropoietin combined with enteral nutrition for the treatment of
      anemia in Crohn's disease: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 120-7
LID - 10.1177/0884533612462744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common and serious complication in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The present study was dedicated to evaluate the
      therapeutic efficacy of erythropoietin (EPO) combined with enteral nutrition (EN)
      in anemic Crohn's disease (CD) patients, in terms of hemoglobin level, treatment 
      success rate, adverse events, and predictor of this therapy. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We performed a prospective study in CD patients. On the basis of
      hemoglobin level, all enrolled patients were divided into anemic and nonanemic
      groups. The anemic group was further divided into EPO and non-EPO subgroups,
      depending on whether EPO was prescribed. Hematological and other parameters were 
      measured initially and in the first 4 weeks after starting treatment. RESULTS: In
      total, 109 patients (49 nonanemic and 60 anemic, including 38 EPO and 22 non-EPO)
      were included. The prevalence of anemia in CD was 55.05%. Age, disease behavior, 
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate were significantly different between anemic and nonanemic
      groups. An increase in hemoglobin level and a significant decrease in C-reactive 
      protein level were observed in the EPO treatment group. Treatment success rate
      was 63.16% in the EPO group, whereas none of patients achieved treatment success 
      in the non-EPO group. CONCLUSION: EPO combined with EN can improve the hemoglobin
      level in anemic CD patients.

LID - 10.1586/egh.12.45 [doi]
AB  - Two-thirds to three-quarters of Crohn's disease patients require intestinal
      surgery for medically refractory disease or complications. Surgery is not a cure 
      and most patients develop recurrent Crohn's disease and require additional
      intestinal resections. There are a number of medications that have been
      investigated for preventing and treating recurrence. Risk factors for
      postoperative disease recurrence help guide the physician in determining the
      appropriate treatment strategy after Crohn's disease surgery. The approach to
      Crohn's disease treatment has evolved over the years. No longer should surgery be
      considered a failure of treatment, rather an important intervention to correct
      irreversible disease. In combination with a better understanding of postoperative
      medication strategies, patients with Crohn's disease may achieve longer term
      remission than previously realized. This review elucidates current understanding 
      of the natural course of postoperative Crohn's disease, monitoring for
      recurrence, the risk factors for recurrence, and provides insight into an
      evolving new paradigm for postoperative Crohn's disease treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The elderly represent a growing demographic of patients with
      IBD. No study has previously described variations in care or medication
      prescriptions in senior patients with IBD. We compared prescription rates among
      elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data.
      METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and 
      Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was
      assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an
      IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were
      identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific
      rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In
      patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for
      oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), 
      while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters).
      Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters 
      analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage 
      was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in
      the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal
      therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US
      and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication
      prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether 
      these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care
      costs.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutrition on gut microflora function in children with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1454-9
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.703234 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment in
      children with active Crohn's disease (CD) but is seldom used in adults with
      active disease. The mode of action of EEN in suppressing mucosal inflammation is 
      not fully understood, but modulation of intestinal microflora activity is one
      possible explanation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      6-week EEN in children with active CD, with special reference to intestinal
      microflora function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 18 children (11
      boys, 7 girls; median age 13.5 years) with active CD (13 children with small
      bowel/colonic and 5 with perianal disease) were analyzed for short chain fatty
      acid (SCFA) pattern as marker of gut microflora function. The children were
      studied before and after EEN treatment. Results from 12 healthy teenagers were
      used for comparison. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) of the children with small
      bowel/colonic CD responded clinically positively to EEN treatment showing
      decreased levels of pro-inflammatory acetic acid as well as increased
      concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyric acids and also of valeric acids,
      similar to the levels in healthy age-matched children. In children with active
      perianal CD, however, EEN had no positive effect on clinical status or
      inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present new data supporting the
      hypothesis that the well-documented anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children
      with active small bowel/colonic CD is brought about by modulation of gut
      microflora activity, resulting in an anti-inflammatory SCFA pattern. By contrast,
      none of the children with perianal disease showed clinical or biochemical
      improvement after EEN treatment.

TI  - Enteral nutrition to suppress postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence: a
      five-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1587-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral
      nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients
      following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to 
      prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty
      consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were
      included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet
      infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). 
      Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction
      (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No
      patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except
      patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence
      requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not
      continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN
      group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence
      requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate
      requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group
      (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the
      control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative
      incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the
      difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this
      study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD
      recurrence.

TI  - Concomitant use of enteral nutrition therapy is associated with sustained
      response to infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1219-23
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2012.120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of Crohn's disease (CD) patients 
      receiving infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy show loss of responsiveness
      despite a good initial response. The factors other than immunomodulators that
      prevent IFX dose escalation have yet to be fully elucidated. This study was
      performed to identify clinical factors or concomitant therapies associated with
      sustained response to IFX. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive CD patients
      who had successful IFX induction therapy between 2002 and 2010 underwent IFX
      maintenance therapy. Patients showing loss of response to IFX were treated with
      IFX intensification therapy. Factors involved in the sustained response to IFX
      were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 85 weeks,
      loss of response to IFX was observed in 30 (40.5%) cases. On logistic regression 
      analysis, concomitant use of enteral nutrition (EN) therapy (elemental and/or
      polymeric formulas) was identified as an independent factor associated with
      sustained response to IFX. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
      indicated a cutoff value of 600 kcal/day. We divided the patients into the 'EN
      group' (>/= 600 kcal/day) and 'control group' (<600 kcal/day). The cumulative
      number of loss of response was significantly lower in the EN group (odds ratio:
      0.23, P = 0.0043). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the significantly lower rate
      of loss of response in the EN group (P = 0.013). Multivariate hazard ratio was
      0.37 (P = 0.025). Type of EN formula did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS:
      Concomitant use of EN >/= 600 kcal/day is likely to yield a sustained response to
      IFX in CD patients.

TI  - Crohn's disease affecting the small bowel is associated with reduced appetite and
      elevated levels of circulating gut peptides.
PG  - 404-11

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Appetite disturbance is an important nutritional issue in
      Crohn's disease (CD), but the biological basis is unclear. Satiety signals such
      as polypeptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are produced by
      enteroendocrine cells (EEC). In animal models, upregulation of EEC plays a
      mechanistic role in feeding disturbance and weight loss. We recently showed
      increased EEC activity in tissue from active small bowel CD. This study
      investigated EEC products in plasma in CD, and appetite-related symptoms.
      METHODOLOGY: Active CD patients and a healthy reference group were studied. Gut
      peptide responses to a mixed nutrient test meal were measured by ELISA. Symptoms 
      were assessed by visual analogue score. A patient subset was re-studied in
      remission. RESULTS: CD subjects displayed reduced appetite (p < 0.0001) before
      and after eating. Total PYY was increased 2.2-fold (p = 0.04) and correlated with
      nausea (p = 0.036) and bloating (p = 0.037) scores only in small bowel CD.
      Postprandial plasma ghrelin levels were also elevated. Leptin correlated with
      body mass index (p = 0.0001) and weight loss (p = 0.01). GLP-1 and GIP were not
      elevated. In remission, postprandial PYY and ghrelin reverted to control levels. 
      DISCUSSION: Enhanced EEC responses may directly and adversely affect appetite in 
      CD patients through increased gut-brain signalling.

LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2374-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the problems associated with infliximab (IFX) treatment for
      Crohn's disease (CD) is loss of response during maintenance therapy. AIMS: The
      aim of this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was to determine whether
      enteral nutrition (EN) added to the IFX therapy regimen is effective for
      maintaining remission in adult CD patients. METHODS: Patients with CD who had
      started IFX therapy between April 2003 and March 2008 at any one of the seven
      participating medical centers and who met the following inclusion criteria were
      enrolled in the study: remission after triple infusions of IFX followed by IFX
      maintenance therapy every 8 weeks, and follow-up data available for >/= 1 year.
      Remission was defined as a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of <0.3 mg/dL, and
      recurrence was defined as an increase in CRP to >/= 1.5 mg/dL or shortening of
      the IFX interval. Patients were classified by EN dosage into two groups (EN group
      and non-EN group). The cumulative remission period and related factors were
      analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 102 adult CD patients who met the inclusion criteria,
      45 were in the EN group and 57 were in the non-EN group. The cumulative remission
      rate was significantly higher in the EN group than in the non-EN group (P =
      0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that EN was the only suppressive factor
      for disease recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that
      among this CD patient cohort, EN combined with IFX maintenance treatment was
      clinically useful for maintaining remission.

TI  - Impact of environmental and dietary factors on the course of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 3814-22
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i29.3814 [doi]
AB  - Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted
      to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the
      outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of
      smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its
      influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD,
      active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this
      clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients
      who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit
      in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of
      IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very
      frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general
      dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients
      should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role 
      of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation
      of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem 
      to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil,
      medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a
      therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in
      inactive UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is an incurable and difficult to diagnose
      condition. While high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) remains the best
      biochemical marker, we evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of lipid peroxidation 
      indices. METHODS: Malondialdehyde/thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
      (MDA/TBARS), peroxidation potential (PP), lipid hydroperoxides (ROOH),
      oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and oxLDL antibodies (OLAB) were
      assessed in 52 CD patients and 99 volunteers and referred to clinical activity,
      inflammation, nutritional and antioxidant status. RESULTS: MDA/TBARS were higher 
      in CD while oxLDL and PP decreased in active disease and ROOH and OLAB did not
      differ. oxLDL and PP negatively and OLAB positively correlated with CD activity. 
      MDA/TBARS positively correlated with IL-6 and SOD-1 and negatively with catalase.
      IL-6 and SOD-1 explained 24% in MDA/TBARS variability. PP negatively correlated
      with CRP, platelets, and IL-6 and positively with glutathione peroxidase-1,
      paraoxonase-1, cholesterol, triglycerides, and albumins. Cholesterol and CRP
      explained 57% in PP variability. oxLDL negatively correlated with IL-1 and IL-6
      and positively with glutathione peroxidase-1, paraoxonase-1, cholesterol, and
      albumins. Paraoxonase-1 explained 17% of oxLDL variability. OLAB positively
      correlated with IL-1 explaining 10% in its variability and negatively with
      cholesterol. MDA/TBARS were the best predictor of CD, comparable to CRP, with
      high specificity (MDA/TBARS sensitivity and specificity: 75% and 90%; CRP: 76%
      and 93%). Combined assessment of MDA/TBARS and CRP improved sensitivity (94%)
      corresponding with acceptable specificity (81%). CONCLUSIONS: MDA/TBARS are
      elevated in CD and may help to rule the disease out, while the combined
      evaluation with CRP may serve for CD confirmation. oxLDL and PP depended on
      substrate availability, decreased in CD.

TI  - The effect of adalimumab for induction of endoscopic healing and normalization of
      mucosal cytokine gene expression in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1200-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of adalimumab on the induction of complete 
      endoscopic healing and normalization of mucosal cytokine gene expression in
      patients with active Crohn's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective,
      single-center study including 77 patients. All were examined by endoscopy before 
      initiation of adalimumab induction therapy with a minimum of six adalimumab
      injections. Patients were treated until documentation of complete endoscopic
      healing. Biopsies for measurements of mRNA expression levels of
      interleukin(IL)-17A (IL17A), IL23, interferon-gamma (IFNG), tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF), IL10 and Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3), as well as for
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) were sampled at pre- and post-treatment endoscopy, and
      from 17 control patients. RESULTS: Complete endoscopic healing was achieved in
      27.3% after 10 weeks of treatment, documented by endoscopy at week 12. Cumulative
      endoscopic healing after 52 weeks was 44.2%. Complete endoscopic healing led to a
      significant reduction in mRNA expression levels for all cytokines except IL10.
      Elevated expression of TNF and IL-17A persisted in 52% and 76%, respectively, of 
      patients with complete endoscopic remission. Pre-treatment cytokine gene
      expression levels did not predict response to adalimumab therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Adalimumab induces accumulated complete endoscopic healing in 44% of patients
      after 52 weeks of therapy. Normalization of mucosal gene expression of cytokines 
      does not occur in all patients with endoscopy-verified healed mucosa. Inclusion
      of normalized mucosal cytokine expression into the concept of mucosal healing
      could have an impact on long-term clinical outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCAs) have been detected in the serum of patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and their unaffected family
      members. The aim of this study was to establish the value of serological markers 
      as predictors of UC and CD. DESIGN: Individuals who developed CD or UC were
      identified from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
      (EPIC) study. At recruitment, none of the participants had a diagnosis of CD or
      UC. For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for
      centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of
      cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, 
      perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against
      Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional
      logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating
      characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77
      individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 
      (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively.
      Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in
      predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively).
      The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to
      diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is
      able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Estrogen has been proposed to modulate gut inflammation
      through an effect on estrogen receptors found on gastrointestinal epithelial and 
      immune cells. The role of postmenopausal hormone therapy on risk of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a
      prospective cohort study of 108,844 postmenopausal US women (median age, 54
      years) enrolled in 1976 in the Nurses' Health Study without a prior history of CD
      or UC. Every 2 years, we have updated information on menopause status,
      postmenopausal hormone use, and other risk factors. Self-reported diagnoses of CD
      and UC were confirmed through medical record review by 2 gastroenterologists who 
      were blinded to exposure information. We used Cox proportional hazards models to 
      calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
      RESULTS: Through 2008, with more than 1.8 million person-years of follow-up, we
      documented 138 incident cases of CD and 138 cases of UC. Compared with women who 
      never used hormones, the multivariate-adjusted HR for UC was 1.71 (95% CI,
      1.07-2.74) among women who currently used hormones and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.03-2.66)
      among past users. The risk of UC appeared to increase with longer duration of
      hormone use (P(trend) = .04) and decreased with time since discontinuation. There
      was no difference in risk according to the type of hormone therapy used (estrogen
      vs estrogen plus progestin). In contrast, we did not observe an association
      between current use of hormones and risk of CD (multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.19;
      95% CI, 0.78-1.82). The effect of hormones on risk of UC and CD was not modified 
      by age, body mass index, or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In a large prospective cohort
      of women, postmenopausal hormone therapy was associated with an increased risk of
      UC but not CD. These findings indicate that pathways related to estrogens might
      mediate the pathogenesis of UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - Our therapeutic goals for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are evolving. Until the last decade the goals were primarily the treatment of
      symptoms. Regulatory approval for ulcerative colitis therapies have been based on
      short-term improvements in clinical indices and, most recently, the ability to
      heal the colonic mucosa, whereas approval for Crohn's disease therapies have been
      based on reductions in the CDAI (Crohn's Disease Activity Index). Over the past
      decade there has been increasing evidence in favor of more 'objective' measures
      of biologic disease activity including biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and 
      mucosal healing in Crohn's disease and the histologic resolution of active
      inflammation in ulcerative colitis. The objective changes have provided expanded 
      therapeutic goals based on longer-term maintenance therapies with the potential
      to modify the chronic disease behavior and to reduce pharmacoeconomic costs
      (reductions in hospitalizations, surgeries and neoplasia).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Long-term data on the influence of cigarette smoking, especially
      cessation, on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      limited. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 229,111 women in the
      Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Biennially, we
      collected updated data on cigarette smoking, other risk factors, and diagnoses of
      CD or UC confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: Over 32 years in NHS and 18
      years in NHS II, we documented 336 incident cases of CD and 400 incident cases of
      UC. Compared with never smokers, the multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of CD was
      1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.53) among current smokers and 1.35
      (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) among former smokers. Increasing pack-years was associated
      with increasing risk of CD (Ptrend < 0.0001), whereas smoking cessation was
      associated with an attenuation of risk. By contrast, the multivariate HR of UC
      was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61-1.20) among current smokers and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26-1.93)
      among former smokers. The risk of UC was significantly increased within 2-5 years
      of smoking cessation (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.00-4.67) and remained persistently
      elevated over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with an
      increased risk of CD, but not UC. By contrast, former smoking is associated with 
      an increased risk of UC, with risk persisting over two decades after cessation.

TI  - [A case of Crohn's disease developing bladder rupture 4 months after laparoscopic
      sigmoidectomy with partial cystectomy for vesicosigmoidal fistula].
PG  - 237-41
AB  - A 32-year-old well-nourished man having a vesicosigmoidal fistula due to Crohn's 
      disease received laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with partial cystectomy. The bladder 
      wall was closed with an all-layer running suture and additional interrupted
      sutures using 2-0 Vicryl. Four months after surgery, the suture site on the
      bladder showed perforation to the abdominal cavity. Since the same event occurred
      again 6 months after surgery, open partial cystectomy was performed to repair the
      perforated site 8 months after the initial surgery. The perforated site showed a 
      thinning bladder wall composed of normal urothelium, scar tissue and thin
      detrusor muscle. Non-caseating granuloma was not found in the specimen, even
      though it was slightly observed in the margin of the detrusor muscle resected in 
      the initial surgery. Although it was possible that the persisting activity of
      Crohn's disease, subclinical impaired nutrition due to Crohn's disease or
      insufficient suturing of the bladder wall were involved in the bladder rupture,
      the definitive cause remains unknown.

TI  - Menarche in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2975-81
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2235-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The timing of menarche in Crohn's disease (CD) is poorly
      described. Our objectives were to study age at menarche onset in CD, and factors 
      associated with this. METHODS: We compared the age at menarche of 34 CD patients 
      with that for 545 controls, using data in the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey (NHANES). RESULTS: Mean chronological age (CA) of CD patients 
      (15.6 years) did not differ from that of the NHANES cohort (15.7 years; P =
      0.91). The median CA at menarche (13.9 years) in CD was older than in the NHANES 
      sample (12.0 years) (P < 0.00005). In CD patients, the cumulative incidence of
      menarche was 10 % at CA 12 years, 51 % at CA 14 years, and 100 % at CA 16 years. 
      Sixty-eight percent reached menarche by bone age (BA) 13.5 years and 100 % by BA 
      greater than 14.0 years. Menarche occurred earliest in South Asians, followed by 
      East Asians, and then Caucasians (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CA at menarche is
      delayed in CD compared with the NHANES cohort. BA at menarche in CD is similar to
      BA at menarche reported for healthy children. CA at menarche in CD differs by
      race. If menarche has not occurred by BA greater than 14.0 years, endocrinology
      referral should be considered.

TI  - The gut microbiota elicits a profound metabolic reorientation in the mouse
      jejunal mucosa during conventionalisation.
PG  - 1306-14
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301955 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and 
      nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the
      proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions
      occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is
      important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this
      intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised
      with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial
      colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome,
      histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses
      were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the
      colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day 
      after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the
      basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during
      conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an
      oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue
      transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified 
      tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic
      reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response
      signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin
      sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the
      dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the 
      jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The
      molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the
      declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for
      instance.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that 
      affects primarily the gastrointestinal system but can be associated with
      extraintestinal manifestations. Latent pulmonary involvement in children with CD 
      has been described, but symptomatic pulmonary disease has rarely been reported in
      children. In this review, we report two pediatric cases, one with pleural
      effusion at the time of CD diagnosis and the other with bilateral cavitary
      lesions in a previously diagnosed CD patient. We review the current literature
      and summarize the diagnosis and management of pulmonary involvement in CD.
      Awareness of these pulmonary complications of CD in children may lead to more
      prompt diagnosis, guide appropriate therapy, and decrease morbidity.

TI  - Microbiota separation and C-reactive protein elevation in treatment-naive
      pediatric granulomatous Crohn disease.
PG  - 243-50
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182617c16 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the presence of 
      noncaseating mucosal granuloma is sufficient for diagnosing Crohn disease (CD)
      and may represent a specific immune response or microbial-host interaction. The
      cause of granulomas in CD is unknown and their association with the intestinal
      microbiota has not been addressed with high-throughput methodologies. METHODS:
      The mucosal microbiota from 3 different pediatric centers was studied with 454
      pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal small subunit (SSU) 
      ribosomal region in transverse colonic biopsy specimens from 26 controls and 15
      treatment-naive pediatric CD cases. Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis (MAP) was tested with real-time polymerase chain reaction. The
      correlation of granulomatous inflammation with C-reactive protein was expanded to
      86 treatment-naive CD cases. RESULTS: The CD microbiota separated from controls
      by distance-based redundancy analysis (P = 0.035). Mucosal granulomata found in
      any portion of the intestinal tract associated with an augmented colonic
      bacterial microbiota divergence (P = 0.013). The granuloma-based microbiota
      separation persisted even when research center bias was eliminated (P = 0.04).
      Decreased Roseburia and Ruminococcus in granulomatous CD were important in this
      separation; however, principal coordinates analysis did not reveal partitioning
      of the groups. CRP levels >1 mg/dL predicted the presence of mucosal granulomata 
      (odds ratio 28 [6-134.32]; 73% sensitivity, 91% specificity). CONCLUSIONS:
      Granulomatous CD associates with microbiota separation and C-reactive protein
      elevation in treatment-naive children; however, overall dysbiosis in pediatric CD
      appears rather limited. Geographical/center bias should be accounted for in
      future multicenter microbiota studies.

TI  - An update of the role of nutritional therapy in the management of Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 872-82
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0617-9 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is an increasingly global health concern. Currently without a
      cure, it significantly alters the quality of life of Crohn's disease sufferers
      and places a heavy financial burden on the community. Recent reports show that
      the rising prevalence of Crohn's disease is no longer confined to Western
      countries, with considerable increases seen particularly in Asia. Nutritional
      problems are often associated with Crohn's disease, most notably in the
      paediatric population, with underweight and stunting commonly seen at
      presentation. In addition, linear growth retardation and pubertal delay can also 
      manifest in these younger patients. Therefore, exclusive enteral nutrition has
      been used as a therapeutic option to treat Crohn's disease, in part to address
      the nutritional complications of the disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition can
      improve nutrition as well as induce remission at a rate equivalent to
      corticosteroids. It is safe particularly with long-term use and can induce
      mucosal healing, considered the gold standard for therapy, at a rate superior to 
      corticosteroids. Exclusive enteral nutrition has thus become the preferred
      therapeutic option in many centres for the treatment of paediatric Crohn's
      disease. This review discusses the role of exclusive enteral nutrition as a
      therapeutic option for the treatment of Crohn's disease, as well as the latest
      findings into its mechanisms of action.

TI  - Body composition in Indian patients with Crohn's disease during active and
      remission phase.
PG  - 285-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The alterations in the body composition (BC) in both the active and
      remission phase of Crohn's disease (CD) are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To
      assess the BC of the patients with CD in active and remission phase, and compare 
      with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: BC was assessed by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis using Tanita TBF-215 leg to leg portable impedance analyzer in 123
      patients with CD and 100 matched HC. Diet intake was assessed by 24 hours diet
      recall method. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 36.4 +/- 12.6 years and 56% 
      were males. Patients in active phase as well as in remission phase had a lower
      BMI than HC (18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 23.9 +/- 4.0; p = 0.001 and 18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 21.6
      +/- 5.0; p = 0.002). The fat mass (FM) in active phase was significantly lower
      than that in remission phase (8.2 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.4 +/- 10.6 kg; p = 0.005) and HC
      (8.2 +/- 5.9 kg vs. 14.1 +/- 7.5 kg; p = 0.001). FM did not differ between
      remission phase and HC. The fat free mass (FFM) of HC was significantly higher
      than that of both remission phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 43.3 +/- 10.4 kg; p =
      0.001) and active phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 40.7 +/- 8.5 kg; p = 0.001). There
      was no difference in the FFM of patients in both phases; p = 0.356. The intake of
      macronutrients was comparable between the two phases; however lower than that of 
      HC. CONCLUSION: Both FM and FFM were depleted in the active phase, while only FFM
      was deficient in the remission phase of CD, indicating a poor recovery of lean
      mass in remission.

PG  - 6-11
LID - 10.1159/000337357 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Clostridium
      difficile infection in hospitalized children with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) and to compare it to other immunosuppressed patients at risk (oncology
      patients) as well as to immunocompetent patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from 
      all hospitalized children who underwent stool detection of C. difficile toxins A 
      and B (n = 757) in a 5.5-year study period. RESULTS: The number of positive tests
      was significantly increased in the oncology group compared to the IBD group
      (12.45 vs. 6.02%, p = 0.03) and immunocompetent group (12.45 vs. 5.7%, p = 0.01).
      Patients who had C. difficile infection used antibiotics prior to the test more
      often than patients who did not (12.69 vs. 1.73%, p = 0.03). Pearson's
      correlation was positive for C. difficile infection and both antibiotics and
      immunosuppressants, while no correlation was found regarding age and gender.
      There were no significant differences regarding either IBD diagnosis (Crohn's
      disease vs. ulcerative colitis, p = 0.71) or treatment used for IBD (p = 0.53)
      and C. difficile infection. CONCLUSION: In our setting, the incidence of C.
      difficile infection among hospitalized children with active IBD was found to be
      low. Children at increased risk for C. difficile infection were oncology patients
      receiving immunosuppressants and antibiotics.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While the short-term benefits of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      for induction of remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD) are well
      documented, the longer-term outcomes are less clear. AIM: This retrospective
      study aimed to ascertain the outcomes for up to 24 months following EEN in a
      group of children with CD. METHODS: Children treated with EEN as initial therapy 
      for newly diagnosed CD over a 5-year period were identified. Details of disease
      activity, growth, and drug requirements over the period of follow-up were noted. 
      Outcomes in children managed with EEN were compared to a group of children
      initially treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Over this time period, 31
      children were treated with EEN and 26 with corticosteroids. Twenty-six (84 %) of 
      the 31 children treated with EEN entered remission. Children treated with EEN
      exhibited lower pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) scores at 6
      months (p = 0.02) and received lower cumulative doses of steroids over the study 
      period (p < 0.0001) than the group treated with corticosteroids. Height
      increments over 24 months were greater in the EEN group (p = 0.01). Although the 
      median times to relapse were the same, the EEN group had a lower incidence of
      relapse in each time interval and survival curve analysis showed lower risk of
      relapse (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: EEN lead to multiple benefits beyond the
      initial period of inducing remission for these children, with positive outcomes
      over 2 years from diagnosis. Of particular clinical relevance to growing children
      was the reduced exposure to corticosteroids.

      risk, management strategies, prevention].
PG  - 595-600
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1299462 [doi]
AB  - The postoperative morbidity rate following bowel resections for Crohn's disease
      is higher than for other benign disease. The incidence of postoperative
      intraabdominal septic complications (anastomotic leak, bowel fistula,
      intraabdominal abscess, peritonitis) is 5 - 30 %. Preoperative weight loss,
      prolonged refractory symptoms and penetrating disease behaviour are significant
      determinants of postoperative complication risk. Preoperative enteral nutrition, 
      antibiotics, percutaneous abscess drainage and cessation of steroids might reduce
      the risk of surgery, however, more evidence is needed. The intake of
      immunosuppressive agents (mainly, azathioprine) can be continued perioperatively.
      The occurrence of postoperative intraabdominal septic complications is associated
      with an increased risk of surgical recurrence in patients with terminal ileitis, 
      however, the long-term prognosis could be improved in the latter patients by
      secondary fecal diversion. There is no association between postoperative
      morbidity and long-term outcome in patients with Crohn's colitis.

TI  - Changes of faecal microbiota in patients with Crohn's disease treated with an
      elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 736-42
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2012.04.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease. Elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition are effective therapies
      for Crohn's disease; however, changes of microbiota as a result of both
      treatments have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To elucidate changes of faecal
      microbiota in Crohn's disease patients treated with elemental diet and total
      parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 33 active
      Crohn's disease patients and 17 healthy subjects, and recollected after elemental
      diet (8 patients) and total parenteral nutrition (9 patients). Terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16srDNA was
      performed to evaluate the whole microbiota. Specific quantitative PCR was then
      used to determine populations of predominant bacterial groups. RESULTS: In
      Crohn's disease patients, the number of terminal restriction fragments, which
      reflects bacterial species, was significantly lower. Populations of total
      bacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly lower and the ratio of
      Enterococcus was higher. The number of terminal restriction fragments was
      significantly decreased after total parenteral nutrition, but not after elemental
      diet. Population of Bacteroides fragilis significantly decreased after elemental 
      diet, while population of Enterococcus significantly increased after total
      parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients
      was markedly different from healthy subjects. Species diversity was reduced by
      total parenteral nutrition, but not by elemental diet.

PG  - 319-22

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk
      assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support.
      Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is 
      a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of
      inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition
      screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics
      (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids),
      Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition
      Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease.
      Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health
      Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS:
      There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but
      there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). 
      No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children 
      scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the 
      degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children
      had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high
      risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored
      at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools
      for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential
      to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Combined immunosuppression by immunomodulators and biological therapy has become 
      standard in the medical management of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) because of clearly demonstrated efficacy. Clinical studies,
      registries, and case reports warn of the increased risk of infections,
      particularly opportunistic infections; however, already in the steroid
      monotherapy era, patients are at risk because it is accepted that a patient
      should be considered immunosuppressed when receiving a daily dose of 20 mg of
      prednisone for 2 weeks. Prescriptions increasingly involve azathioprine,
      methotrexate, and various biological agents. The TREAT registry evaluated safety 
      in >6000 adult patients, half of them treated with infliximab (IFX) for about 1.9
      years. IFX-treated patients had an increased risk of infections and this was
      associated with disease severity and concomitant prednisone use. The REACH study,
      evaluating the efficacy of IFX in children with moderate-to-severe Crohn disease,
      refractory to immunomodulatory treatment, reports serious infections as the major
      adverse events and their frequency is higher with shorter treatment intervals.
      The combination of immunosuppressive medications is a risk factor for
      opportunistic infections. Exhaustive guidelines on prophylaxis, diagnosis, and
      management of opportunistic infections in adult patients with IBD have been
      published by a European Crohn's and Colitis Organization working group, including
      clear evidence-based statements. We have reviewed the literature on infections in
      pediatric IBD as well as the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines
      to present a commentary on infection prophylaxis for the pediatric age group.

LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2011-300651 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To describe the change in incidence of paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) observed at the National Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology and Nutrition, and to determine whether the presenting disease
      phenotype and disease outcomes have changed during the past decade. METHODS: The 
      annual incidence of IBD in Irish children aged <16 years was calculated for the
      years 2000-2010. Two subsets of patients, group A (diagnosed between 1 January
      2000 and 31 December 2001), and group B (diagnosed between 1 January and 31
      December 2008) were phenotyped according to the Paris Classification. Phenotype
      at diagnosis and 2-year follow-up were then compared. RESULTS: 406 new cases of
      IBD were identified. The incidence was 2.5/100 000/year in 2001, 7.3 in 2008 and 
      5.6 in 2010, representing a significant increase in the number of new cases of
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There were 238 cases of CD; 129
      of UC; and 39 of IBD unclassified. Comparing groups A and B, no differences were 
      found in disease location at diagnosis or, for CD, in its behaviour. CONCLUSIONS:
      There has been a substantial and sustained increase in the incidence of childhood
      UC and CD in Ireland over a relatively short period of time. However, disease
      phenotype at diagnosis has not changed. At 2 years follow-up, CD appears to
      progress less frequently than in some neighbouring countries. These variations
      remain unexplained. Prospective longitudinal studies will help to elucidate
      further the epidemiology of childhood IBD.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can
      affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune
      processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves
      some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children,
      in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with
      similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody
      stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed 
      during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in
      these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be
      especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As
      such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating
      patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a 
      variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved
      endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis 
      and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of
      complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for
      practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks
      and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and
      especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not
      geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the
      management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to
      educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for
      children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans
      between primary care and subspecialty providers.

TI  - Comparison of magnetic resonance enterography with endoscopy, histopathology, and

PG  - 178-84
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182598465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Children with Crohn disease (CD) often undergo
      cross-sectional imaging during clinical evaluation. Magnetic resonance
      enterography (MRE) is becoming the preferred radiologic assessment due to the
      lack of radiation exposure; however, there are few data in children with CD
      comparing MRE with objective disease measures. The aim of the present study was
      to compare MRE with endoscopy, histopathology, and laboratory evaluation in
      children with CD. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved
      query of our prospective CD MRE database, which includes data in children with CD
      undergoing MRE since 2008. RESULTS: A total of 147 MRE studies were performed in 
      119 different children with symptomatic CD. Of those, 53 (39.6%) MRE studies were
      performed at diagnosis to evaluate small bowel disease burden. A total of 117
      (79.6%) MRE studies displayed active and/or chronic disease, whereas 30 (20.4%)
      MRE studies were normal. When compared with normal MRE studies, active
      inflammation on MRE was associated with a higher mean C-reactive protein (3.6 vs 
      1.1, P < 0.001), higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (36 vs 22, P = 0.0.31),
      higher platelet value (439 vs 352, P = 0.033), and lower albumin (3.4 vs 3.7, P =
      0.049). Comparison between MRE and endoscopy demonstrated excellent agreement
      when ulcers were present, and moderate agreement with histopathology.
      CONCLUSIONS: Active inflammation on MRE is associated with higher C-reactive
      protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelets, and lower albumin in children
      with CD. MRE displays excellent agreement with endoscopic disease described by
      ulcers but poor agreement with mild mucosal disease described by erythema and
      friability. The present study adds to a growing body of evidence that MRE
      provides excellent assessment of inflammation and measures disease activity in
      CD.

LID - 10.1016/j.gtc.2012.01.011 [doi]
AB  - Disease recurrence following resective surgery for Crohn disease remains a
      challenging clinical problem, and more studies are needed to better define risk
      stratification and treatment recommendations in the postoperative setting.
      Endoscopy remains the gold standard for the assessment of postoperative disease
      recurrence, and all Crohn disease patients who undergo surgery should undergo
      ileocolonoscopy within 6 to 12 months of surgery. The degree of endoscopic
      recurrence in the neoterminal ileum during this procedure provides prognostic
      information regarding the severity of the future disease course. WCE, MRE, and
      SICUS are all promising noninvasive modalities to assess for postoperative Crohn 
      disease activity. However, further studies are needed to better define scoring
      systems, operating characteristics and variability, and prognostic data for each 
      of these modalities. In patients at risk for early disease recurrence, more
      aggressive prophylactic therapy should be considered, in hopes of delivering true
      "top-down" therapy that may offer maximum impact in altering the natural history 
      of Crohn disease.

TI  - Role of nutrition and microbiota in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 524-35
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100630 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely
      used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies
      examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD.
      METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed
      retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha
      beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for
      loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed.
      RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or
      indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean
      age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration
      of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the
      cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was
      associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with
      linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001).
      Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly
      (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha
      treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders
      had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha 
      treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the
      effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD.
      Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.

      adsorptive apheresis induced clinical remission in a Crohn's disease patient with
      the loss of response to scheduled adalimumab maintenance therapy: a case report.
PG  - 595-9
AB  - A 21-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) at the age
      of 14 was admitted to our hospital due to CD flare-up while under scheduled
      adalimumab (ADA) maintenance therapy. His symptoms remained virtually unchanged
      following high dose corticosteroid therapy. Seven days later, combination therapy
      with ADA plus intensive granulocyte/monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) was
      initiated, which induced clinical remission. Therefore, combination therapy with 
      ADA plus intensive GMA appears to be an effective therapeutic option for patients
      with severe CD while under scheduled ADA maintenance therapy.

TI  - Common NOD2 risk variants in African Americans with Crohn's disease are due
      exclusively to recent Caucasian admixture.
PG  - 2357-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22944 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is highly heritable. NOD2 has emerged as the
      main susceptibility gene among individuals of European ancestry; however, NOD2
      does not appear to contribute to CD susceptibility among many non-European
      populations. Today's African American (AA) population represents an admixture of 
      West African (80%) and European (20%) ancestry. Since genotype-based tools are
      becoming increasingly available for CD, it is important that we validate the risk
      variants in different populations, such as admixed AAs. METHODS: We analyzed the 
      NOD2 variants among admixed AAs (n = 321, 240 with CD and 111 healthy controls
      [HCs]) and nonadmixed West Africans (n = 40) by genotyping four known
      disease-causing NOD variants. We extracted the publicly available 1000 Genomes
      data on NOD2 variants from 500 subjects of West African origin. Association with 
      disease was evaluated by logistic regression. RESULTS: An association with CD was
      found for the classical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1007fs (2.6% CD, 0% 
      HC, P = 0.012); there was no association when the genotypic and allelic
      frequencies of the risk alleles were compared for SNPs R702W and G908R. No known 
      NOD2 risk alleles were seen in either the West African cohort or in subjects of
      African ancestry from the 1000 Genomes project. CONCLUSIONS: The NOD2 gene is a
      risk for CD in AAs, although the allele frequencies and the attributable risk are
      much lower compared with Caucasians. The risk alleles are not seen in the West
      African population, suggesting that the risk for CD contributed by NOD2 among AAs
      is due exclusively to recent European admixture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of
      immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the 
      spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our
      study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the
      United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through 
      codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia,
      etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with
      infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There
      were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, 
      comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis,
      infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition,
      TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold
      greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of
      infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), 
      pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and
      weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were
      also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) 
      and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for
      significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately
      impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C
      difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.

LID - 10.1542/peds.2011-1700 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unintended variation in the care of patients with Crohn disease (CD) 
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) may prevent achievement of optimal outcomes. We
      sought to improve chronic care delivery and outcomes for children with
      inflammatory bowel disease by using network-based quality improvement methods.
      METHODS: By using a modified Breakthrough Series collaborative structure, 6
      ImproveCareNow Network care centers tested changes in chronic illness care and
      collected data monthly. We used an interrupted time series design to evaluate the
      impact of these changes. RESULTS: Data were available for 843 children with CD
      and 345 with UC. Changes in care delivery were associated with an increase in the
      proportion of visits with complete disease classification, measurement of
      thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) before initiation of thiopurines, and
      patients receiving an initial thiopurine dose appropriate to their TPMT status.
      These were significant in both populations for all process variables (P < .01)
      except for measurement of TPMT in CD patients (P = .12). There were significant
      increases in the proportion of CD (55%-68%) and UC (61%-72%) patients with
      inactive disease. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of CD
      patients not taking prednisone (86%-90%). Participating centers varied in the
      success of achieving these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the outcomes of 
      patients with CD and UC were associated with improvements in the process of
      chronic illness care. Variation in the success of implementing changes suggests
      the importance of overcoming organizational factors related to quality
      improvement success.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both
      genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of
      involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the
      probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various 
      environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut
      microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission,
      reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease
      is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback
      provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput
      genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are
      modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is 
      transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of
      thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers
      generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure
      the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods
      have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time 
      is right to move them to human studies.

PG  - 687-91
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.12.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anaemia and iron deficiency are common in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) however it is not known if the prevalence of
      anaemia and iron deficiency alters following diagnosis. METHODS: Laboratory
      results from diagnosis, and at follow up one and two years later were recorded
      retrospectively in children with IBD recruited from a tertiary centre. Anaemia
      was defined using WHO standards and iron deficiency defined using published
      guidelines. RESULTS: 46 children (16 girls) with Crohn's disease and 34 children 
      (18 girls) with UC were studied. 75% of children with IBD were anaemic at
      diagnosis, 30% were anaemic at follow up two years later. 90% of children with
      Crohn's and 95% of children with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) were iron deficient at
      diagnosis. At follow up two years later 70% of children with Crohn's and 65% of
      children with UC were iron deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent anaemia and iron
      deficiency are common in childhood IBD, prevalence alters with duration of time
      from diagnosis.

TI  - Immuno-inhibitory PD-L1 can be induced by a peptidoglycan/NOD2 mediated pathway
      in primary monocytic cells and is deficient in Crohn's patients with homozygous
      NOD2 mutations.
PG  - 162-9
LID - 10.1016/j.clim.2012.01.016 [doi]
AB  - Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a ubiquitous bacterial membrane product that, despite its 
      well known pro-inflammatory properties, has also been invoked in immuno-tolerance
      of the gastrointestinal tract. PGN-induced mucosal IL-10 secretion and
      downregulation of Toll like receptors are potential mechanisms of action in the
      gut but there are few data on tolerogenic adaptive immune responses and PGN.
      Here, using blood-derived mononuclear cells, we showed that PGN induced marked
      cell surface expression of PD-L1 but not PD-L2 or CD80/CD86, and specifically in 
      the CD14(+) monocytic fraction. This was reproduced at the gene level with rapid 
      induction (<4 h) and, unlike for LPS stimulation, was still sustained at 24 h.
      Using transfected and native muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a cleavage product
      of PGN and a specific NOD2 agonist, in assays with wild type cells or those from 
      patients with Crohn's disease carrying the Leu1007 frameshift mutation of NOD2,
      we showed that (i) both NOD2 dependent and independent signalling (appearing TLR2
      mediated) occurred for PGN upregulation of PD-L1 (ii) upregulation is lost in
      response to MDP in patients with the homozygous mutation and (iii) PD-L1
      upregulation was unaffected in patients with heterozygous mutations as previously
      reported for cytokine responses to MDP. The uptake of PGN and its cleavage
      products by the intestinal mucosa is well recognised and further work should
      consider PD-L1 upregulation as one potential mechanism of the commensal
      flora-driven intestinal immuno-tolerance. Indeed, recent work has shown that loss
      of PD-L1 signalling in the gut breaks CD8(+) T cell tolerance to self antigen and
      leads to severe autoimmune enteritis.

PG  - 166-73
LID - 10.1007/s11894-012-0249-5 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease encompasses a spectrum of disease phenotype,
      severity, and responsiveness to treatment. Intestinal healing rather than merely 
      symptom control is an especially important therapeutic goal in young patients,
      given the potential for growth impairment as a direct effect of persistent
      chronic inflammation and the long life ahead, during which other disease
      complications may occur. Corticosteroids achieve rapid symptom control, but
      alternate steroid-sparing strategies with greater potential to heal the intestine
      must be rapidly adopted. Exclusive enteral nutrition is an alternate short-term
      treatment in pediatric Crohn's disease. The results of multi-center pediatric
      clinical trials of both infliximab and adalimumab in Crohn's disease and of
      infliximab in ulcerative colitis (all in children with unsatisfactory responses
      to other therapies) have now been reported and guide treatment regimens in
      clinical practice. Optimal patient selection and timing of anti-TNF therapy
      requires clinical judgment. Attention must be paid to sustaining responsiveness
      safely.

TI  - Genetic variation within TLR10 is associated with Crohn's disease in a New
      Zealand population.
PG  - 416-20
LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2012.01.015 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the induction and regulation
      of the innate immune system and have been implicated in both infectious and
      inflammatory diseases. Recently the first association of TLR10 with Crohn's
      disease (CD) was reported. Here, we attempted to validate this association, using
      a candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) study of TLR10 in CD. We
      identified tagging SNPs, and genotyped these SNPs in a Caucasian New Zealand
      dataset consisting of 406 CD patients and 638 controls. In this sample, we were
      able to demonstrate an association between CD and several different TLR10 SNPs
      and haplotypes. Phenotypic analysis showed an association with early age at first
      diagnosis, inflammatory and ileocolonic CD behavior, requirement of bowel
      resection, and extra intestinal manifestations. This study provides evidence to
      suggest that genetic variation in TLR10 plays a role in interindividual
      differences in CD susceptibility and clinical outcome.

AB  - Metallothioneins (MTs) are excellent candidate genes for Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease (IBD) and have previously been shown to have altered expression in both
      animal and human studies of IBD. This is the first study to examine genetic
      variants within the MT genes and aims to determine whether such genetic variants 
      have an important role in this disease. 28 tag SNPs in genes MT1 (subtypes A, B, 
      E, F, G, H, M, X), MT2, MT3 and MT4 were selected for genotyping in a
      well-characterized New Zealand dataset consisting of 406 patients with Crohn's
      Disease and 638 controls. We did not find any evidence of association for MT
      genetic variation with CD. The lack of association indicates that genetic
      variants in the MT genes do not play a significant role in predisposing to CD in 
      the New Zealand population.

TI  - Role of fecal calprotectin testing to predict relapse in teenagers with
      inflammatory bowel disease who report full disease control.
PG  - 2018-25
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease undergo regular follow-up
      visits to watch for symptoms that may indicate relapse. Current disease activity 
      is frequently estimated with the use of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). We
      examined the capacity of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) to
      predict relapse in teenagers who report no symptoms. Second, we examined whether 
      calprotectin and CRP as an "add-on test" improve the specificity of PUCAI or
      PCDAI to predict relapse. METHODS: We collected data of 62 consecutive teenagers 
      (31 with Crohn's disease and 31 with ulcerative colitis) who scored their degree 
      of disease control between 90 and 100% on two successive outpatient clinic
      visits. Calprotectin, PUCAI or PCDAI, and CRP were measured at baseline. Primary 
      outcome was symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline, necessitating the
      introduction of steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition, or an aminosalicylate dose
      escalation. RESULTS: Fifteen teenagers (24%) developed symptomatic relapse within
      3 months of baseline. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the
      optimum calprotectin cutpoint to differentiate high from low risk patients was
      500 mug/g. The PUCAI or PCDAI predicted relapse in 42% (11/26) of teenagers with 
      a positive result (score >/= 10 points), while a negative PUCAI or PCDAI result
      reduced the risk of relapse to 11% (4/36). Teenagers with a positive calprotectin
      test had a 53% (10/19) risk of progressing to symptomatic relapse within 3
      months, whereas a negative calprotectin result gave a 12% (5/43) risk of
      symptomatic relapse. A positive CRP result (cutoff 10 mg/L) gave a 50% (4/8) risk
      of relapse, whereas a negative CRP result hardly reduced the risk compared with
      the pretest probability (from 24% to 21% (11/53)). As an add-on test after PUCAI 
      or PCDAI, the calprotectin test limited the number of false positives and thus
      increased the specificity to detect gastrointestinal inflammation: 60% (9/15) of 
      teenagers with positive concordant test results progressed to symptomatic
      relapse. Negative concordance reduced the risk of relapse to 10% (3/32). CRP
      contributed little as add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI: two of five teenagers
      with positive concordant tests progressed to symptomatic relapse (40%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Unlike CRP, fecal calprotectin as an add-on test after PUCAI or
      PCDAI facilitates recognition of preclinical relapse. This could help to identify
      teenagers who require treatment intensification at the time of minimal disease
      rather than at the time of clinically overt relapse. Further studies are
      warranted to determine the impact of fecal calprotectin testing on treatment
      management and outcome.

PG  - 453-60

AB  - Ileocolonoscopy remains the gold standard in diagnosing postoperative recurrence.
      After excluding stricture, wireless capsule endoscopy seemed accurate in small
      series, but no validated score is available. Ultrasonography is a non-invasive
      diagnostic method reducing radiation exposure and emerging as an alternative tool
      for identifying post-operative recurrence. Computed tomography enteroclysis
      yields objective morphologic criteria that help differentiate between recurrent
      disease and fibrostenosis at the anastomotic site, but ionising radiation
      exposure limits its use. Magnetic resonance imaging may be as powerful as
      ileocolonoscopy in diagnosing postoperative recurrence and in predicting the
      clinical outcome using specific MR-scores. Biomarkers such as faecal calprotectin
      and faecal lactoferrin showed promising results, but their specificity in the
      postoperative period will require further investigation. Numerous medications
      have been tested to prevent and/or to treat postoperative recurrence. Efficacy of
      mesalamine is very low and comparable to placebo in most series. Thiopurines have
      modest efficacy in the postoperative setting and are associated with a high rate 
      of adverse events leading to drug withdrawal. Antibiotics such as metronidazole
      or ornidazole may be effective, but toxicity and drug resistance prevent their
      long-term use. Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor therapy is the most potent drug class 
      to prevent and to treat postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease.

      disease.
PG  - 107-12

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Differing protocols have been utilized in published studies evaluating
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in the management of active pediatric Crohn's
      disease. This study aimed to ascertain the protocols currently utilized in
      different pediatric centers around the world and to highlight their similarities 
      and differences. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated to individuals at
      pediatric centers in countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.
      Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at
      their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used
      for administering EEN to these children. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35
      separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks
      to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas 
      were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings
      were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with 
      the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The
      reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common
      recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual
      introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%). CONCLUSIONS:
      This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols
      used in different areas of the world. The development of consistent protocols may
      enhance the acceptance, efficacy and wider utilization of this therapy.

TI  - Clinical features and management of duodenal fistula in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 171-4
LID - 10.5754/hge10205 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Duodenal fistula is rare in patients with Crohn's disease and
      almost all patients require surgery. Generally surgery for duodenal CD and
      reconstruction is considered difficult. We reviewed the clinical features of
      duodenal fistula with CD and considered suitable preoperative treatments.
      METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the records of 10 patients with duodenal fistula
      complicating CD between September 1974 and April 2009. RESULTS: Mean age at
      surgery was 31.5 years (range 22-36). Mean duration from onset of CD or previous 
      surgery was 49.8 months (range 1.5-172.6). All patients were treated with total
      parenteral nutrition before surgery, 3 patients with steroids and 1 patient with 
      infliximab. Synergistic effects of these immunomodulators were not examined in
      this study. Although preoperative treatments improved the values of CD activity
      index (p<0.01) all patients required surgical treatment. Duodenal fistula in all 
      patients resulted from intrinsic CD lesion at the colon or ileum. Although
      immunmodulators had no additional effects on shortening hospital stay or
      improving activity index, simple fistula repair was performed in all patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the additional effects of immunomodulators were not
      confirmed, the sufficient preoperative treatment for duodenal fistula with CD to 
      reduce disease activity seems likely to facilitate subsequent minimal surgery.

PG  - 170-7
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2011.648954 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the
      rate of early (within 30 days) postoperative complications in patients with
      moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) was examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      series of 15 consecutive patients with CD (mean CD activity index score, 270)
      given preoperative TPN for 18-90 days (mean, 46 days) and undergoing bowel
      resection and primary anastomosis was compared with matching controls (105
      patients) consecutively selected from all CD patients operated in Stockholm
      County during a preceding 20-year period without preoperative TPN. RESULTS:
      During the preoperative TPN, all the patients studied displayed clinical
      remission of CD as reflected in improvement in their general well-being, relief
      of abdominal pain, and abatement of fever and diarrhea. There was no significant 
      early postoperative complication in the TPN-treated group, whereas there were 29 
      patients with early postoperative complications in the control group, which means
      a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications when preoperative TPN 
      was not provided. During the preoperative TPN, some crucial variables increased
      such as the body weight, the serum concentrations of albumin and triiodothyronine
      reflecting improved nutritional state, whereas the serum concentration of
      haptoglobin and the white cell count decreased reflecting decreased inflammatory 
      activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that preoperative TPN for at least 18
      days may be recommended to be given to patients with moderate to severe CD until 
      clinical remission is achieved in order to minimize the risk of early
      postoperative complications.

TI  - Feasibility of using MR enterography for the assessment of terminal ileitis and
      inflammatory activity in children with Crohn disease.
PG  - 173-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318249595d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation exposure increases cancer risk in children
      with Crohn disease (CD). Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) can image the
      gastrointestinal tract without exposure to radiation. The aim of the present
      study was to determine whether our MRE protocol could diagnose terminal ileitis
      and the degree of inflammatory activity in children with CD. METHODS:
      Retrospective review of patients 18 years of age or younger who underwent MRE for
      known or suspected CD from June 15, 2007 to April 1, 2010. MRE was performed with
      Volumen and water as oral contrast and gadolinium-based intravenous contrast. No 
      antiperistaltic agent was used. Each MRE was compared with ileal biopsies
      obtained within 90 days. Severity of inflammation on MRE was scored and compared 
      with the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). RESULTS: Seventy-two
      patients underwent 80 MREs during the study period. Forty-two of the 72 patients 
      (58.3%) underwent colonoscopy within 90 days of MRE, and the terminal ileum was
      intubated in 33. Compared with histology, MRE had a sensitivity of 71.4% and a
      specificity of 100% for terminal ileitis. The positive and negative predictive
      values were 100% and 70%, respectively. PCDAI was calculated in 39 of the 72
      patients (54.2%) and had a statistically significant positive correlation with
      MRE score of 0.37 (P = 0.020426). CONCLUSIONS: In children with known or
      suspected CD, our MRE protocol has a high specificity and positive predictive
      value for terminal ileitis. Severity of inflammation on MRE had a statistically
      significant positive correlation with PCDAI.

TI  - Aluminum as an adjuvant in Crohn's disease induction.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1177/0961203311430090 [doi]
AB  - Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a
      ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water,
      waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of
      aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal
      inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet
      unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of
      inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the
      immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be
      adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared
      cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and
      stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota,
      trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The
      inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology.
      It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of
      innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted
      with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound
      surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic
      criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by
      adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the
      consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1365-75
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the
      gastrointestinal tract at any point from the mouth to the rectum. Patients may
      experience diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, abdominal masses, and
      anemia. Extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease include osteoporosis,
      inflammatory arthropathies, scleritis, nephrolithiasis, cholelithiasis, and
      erythema nodosum. Acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein level and
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are often increased with inflammation and may
      correlate with disease activity. Levels of vitamin B12, folate, albumin,
      prealbumin, and vitamin D can help assess nutritional status. Colonoscopy with
      ileoscopy, capsule endoscopy, computed tomography enterography, and small bowel
      follow-through are often used to diagnose Crohn's disease. Ultrasonography,
      computed axial tomography, scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging can
      assess for extraintestinal manifestations or complications (e.g., abscess,
      perforation). Mesalamine products are often used for the medical management of
      mild to moderate colonic Crohn's disease. Antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole,
      fluoroquinolones) are often used for treatment. Patients with moderate to severe 
      Crohn's disease are treated with corticosteroids, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
      or anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab). Severe
      disease may require emergent hospitalization and a multidisciplinary approach
      with a family physician, gastroenterologist, and surgeon.

AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease and, in particular, Crohn's disease
      involves a deregulated mucosal immune system under the influence of intestinal
      flora and environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. A new
      hypothesis has focused on mesenteric fat hypertrophy and the presence of ectopic 
      fat surrounding inflamed bowel, the so-called creeping fat, which are hallmarks
      of Crohn's disease. Mesenteric adipose tissue is currently recognized as an
      active actor in immunity with a capacity for mediator secretion. These mediators 
      include classic pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or chemokines and
      hormone-like adipokines with multiple effects. Mesenteric fat participates in the
      course of Crohn's disease and may play an active role in the regulation of
      intestinal inflammation. However, little is known about the origin and role of
      mesenteric fat in Crohn's disease, essentially because of a lack of experimental 
      models that develop creeping fat. The purpose of this review is to present the
      recent data describing the immune properties of mesenteric fat and the recent
      advances in animal models, which have suggested a new hypothesis about the role
      of creeping fat in Crohn's disease.

TI  - STAT3 genotypic variation and cellular STAT3 activation and colon leukocyte
      recruitment in pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 32-43
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318246be78 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Genotypic variation in signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) increases risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 
      STAT3-dependent inflammatory networks are induced in the colon in these patients.
      We hypothesized that STAT3 "A" risk allele carriage would be associated with
      increased cellular STAT3 activation and colon leukocyte recruitment. METHODS:
      Colonic expression of genes regulating STAT3 signaling and leukocyte recruitment 
      and function was measured in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD)
      stratified by STAT3 genotype. The frequency of colonic pSTAT3* and CXCR2*
      neutrophils was determined using immunohistochemistry. STAT3 tyrosine
      phosphorylation (pSTAT3) was measured in circulating leukocytes by flow
      cytometry, and mechanisms regulating STAT3 activation were tested in IBD
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes (EBL). RESULTS: Colonic
      expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), the STAT3 target gene SOCS3, the neutrophil
      chemoattractants IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL3, and the neutrophil products S100A8,
      S100A9, and S100A12 were increased in patients carrying the STAT3 "A" risk
      allele. The frequency of neutrophils expressing the cognate receptor for IL-8,
      CXCR2, was increased in colonic biopsies from patients carrying the risk allele, 
      and the frequency of pSTAT3* or CXCR2* neutrophils correlated with histologic
      severity. The frequency of CD4 lymphocytes and granulocytes expressing pSTAT3 was
      increased in patients carrying the STAT3 "A" risk allele. EBLs from patients
      carrying the STAT3 "A" risk allele exhibited increased basal and IL-6-stimulated 
      STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, increased transcription of STAT3 and SOCS3 after 
      IL-6 stimulation, and increased membrane localization of the IL-6 receptor,
      GP130, and Janus-associated kinase 2. CONCLUSIONS: The STAT3 "A" risk allele is
      associated with increased cellular STAT3 activation and upregulation of pathways 
      that promote recruitment of CXCR2* neutrophils to the gut.

PG  - 667-74
AB  - Autophagy is a conserved cellular pathway that maintains intracellular
      homeostasis by degrading proteins and cytosolic contents of eukaryotic cells.
      Autophagy clears misfolded and long-lived proteins, damaged organelles and
      invading microorganisms from cells, and provides nutrients and energy in response
      to exposure to cell stressors such as starvation. Defective autophagy has
      recently been linked to a diverse range of disease processes of relevance to
      gastroenterologists and hepatologists including Crohn's disease, pancreatitis,
      hepatitis and cancer. The present article provides an overview of the autophagy
      pathway and discusses gastrointestinal disease processes in which alterations in 
      autophagy have been implicated. The clinical significance of autophagy as a
      potential therapeutic option is also discussed.

TI  - Risk factors for short bowel syndrome in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 447-52
LID - 10.1007/s00595-011-0098-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often need home parenteral nutrition 
      for short bowel syndrome (SBS), as a result of frequent surgery and extended
      bowel resections. We conducted this study to evaluate the influence of the
      patient's condition on the occurrence of SBS in CD. METHODS: The subjects of this
      study were 721 patients, who underwent bowel resections for CD at Hyogo College
      of Medicine between September 1974 and September 2010. The collective total of
      bowel resection operations was 1286. The possible risk factors for SBS were
      analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine
      their predictive significance. RESULTS: SBS was diagnosed in 24 patients. A
      stepwise logistic regression model revealed that penetrating type (odds ratio
      14.9, p = 0.02), remaining small intestine <200 cm (odds ratio 141.4, p < 0.01), 
      ostomy creation (odds ratio 7.5, p = 0.03), and post-total colectomy (odds ratio 
      17.6, p < 0.01) were independent risk factors for SBS. CONCLUSION: These results 
      indicate that the length of remaining small bowel is closely related to SBS in
      patients who have undergone surgery for CD. At least 200 cm of small bowel should
      be preserved to prevent SBS when total colectomy and ostomy creation are
      performed for CD.

TI  - Effects of recombinant human growth hormone on protein turnover in the fasting
      and fed state in adolescents with Crohn disease.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to test whether recombinant human growth
      hormone (rhGH) supplementation would enhance protein synthesis and accretion of
      lean body mass. Eight adolescents (six males and two females; 17.2 +/- 2.6 years;
      age range, 13.7-21.2 years) participated in a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over trial of rhGH. We employed stable isotopes to
      measure proteolysis and protein synthesis during fasting and fed conditions
      during two 6-month treatment conditions. We also measured bone mineral density
      (BMD), markers of bone turnover, and body composition. Whole-body proteolysis,
      phenylalanine catabolism, and protein synthesis did not differ during treatment
      with rhGH vs. placebo. Enteral nutrition suppressed proteolysis and increased
      protein synthesis similarly during placebo and rhGH treatments. We conclude that 
      rhGH is unlikely to provide sufficient metabolic benefit to warrant its use as an
      adjunct treatment in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn disease. A high
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and suboptimal BMD existed, which deserves
      further investigation and clinical attention.

TI  - Clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease in children do not correlate
      with four common polymorphisms of the transforming growth factor beta1 gene.
PG  - 641-4
AB  - Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a cytokine affecting cell
      proliferation and development, which also has an immunomodulatory activity.
      Correlations between polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene and clinical parameters 
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported previously in adults. Here, we 
      tested whether such correlations occur in pediatric patients suffering from IBD. 
      One hundred and four pediatric IBD patients were involved in this study. Among
      them, 36 were diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (CD) and 68 were diagnosed with
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The control group consisted of 103 children, in which
      IBD was excluded. TGF-beta1 levels were determined in plasma and intestinal
      mucosa samples. The presence of the TGF beta1 protein and the amount of TGF beta1
      mRNA were estimated in intestinal mucosa by immunohistochemistry and reverse
      transcription Real-Time PCR, respectively. Four common polymorphisms of the
      TGF-beta1 gene were investigated: -800G/A, -509C/T, 869T/C and 915G/C. No
      significant correlation between TGF-beta1 genotypes and (i) TGF-beta1 levels in
      plasma and tissue samples, (ii) TGF-beta1 gene expression efficiency in
      intestinal mucosa, (iii) IBD clinical parameters and (iv) inflammatory activity
      could be detected in children suffering from IBD. We conclude that, contrary to
      previous suggestions, the four common polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene do not 
      influence the susceptibility to or clinical parameters of IBD in the tested
      population of children.

TI  - The bariatric surgery patient: lost to follow-up; from morbid obesity to severe
      malnutrition.
PG  - e21-5
LID - 10.4158/EP11200.CR [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the potential long-term risk of malnutrition after
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) through an uncommon occurrence of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) postoperatively, which posed a serious threat to the
      nutritional status and the life of the patient. METHODS: We present a case report
      of a 44-year-old woman in whom Crohn disease developed 4 years after she had
      undergone GBP. The double insult of IBD and GBP resulted in severe malnutrition, 
      with a serum albumin concentration of 0.9 g/dL (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0),
      weight loss, and watery diarrhea necessitating 6 hospital admissions during a
      period of 7 months. RESULTS: Ultimately, the administration of total parenteral
      nutrition with aggressive macronutrient, vitamin, and mineral repletion resulted 
      in substantial improvement in the patient's strength, function, and quality of
      life, in parallel with diminished symptoms of IBD. CONCLUSION: Rarely, IBD
      develops after GBP, but the relationship between the 2 conditions remains
      unclear. Regardless, in addition to the altered anatomy after bariatric surgery, 
      the further insult of IBD poses a severe threat to the nutritional status of
      affected patients. Malnutrition needs to be recognized and aggressively treated. 
      Nutritional markers should be followed closely in this population of bariatric
      patients in an effort to avert the onset of severe malnutrition.

TI  - Smokers with active Crohn's disease have a clinically relevant dysbiosis of the
      gastrointestinal microbiota.
PG  - 1092-100
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21864 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have an intestinal dysbiosis with 
      components of the microbiota exerting differential immune effects. Smoking is
      associated with an increased incidence of CD, more frequent relapse, and greater 
      burden of surgery. This study aimed to investigate the association between
      smoking and the intestinal microbiota in patients with active CD. METHODS:
      Patients with active CD (n = 103) and healthy controls (n = 66) were recruited
      and demographic and clinical data recorded including current smoking behavior.
      Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization
      using probes targeting 16S rRNA of bacteria previously shown to be altered in
      active CD (bifidobacteria, bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium
      rectale, Escherichia coli, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). RESULTS: In total, 
      29/101 (29%) patients with CD and 8/58 (14%) controls were current smokers (P =
      0.032). Following multivariate analysis, smoking was found to have a significant 
      and independent effect on the microbiota of patients with CD, with higher
      Bacteroides-Prevotella in smokers (38.4%) compared with nonsmokers (28.1%)
      (F((1,93)) = 12.6, P = 0.001). Healthy controls who smoked also had higher
      Bacteroides-Prevotella (34.8%) than nonsmokers (24.1%) (F((1,55)) = 4.5, P =
      0.038). In the pooled multivariate analysis, patients with CD had higher
      bifidobacteria (F((1,156)) = 30.5, P < 0.001), higher Bacteroides-Prevotella
      (F((1,156)) = 6.5, P = 0.012), and lower F. prausnitzii (F((1,156)) = 3.8, P =
      0.052) compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers have luminal
      microbiota that consist of significantly higher bacteroides. Investigation of
      whether this is one mechanism through which the negative effects of smoking on CD
      are mediated is warranted.

PG  - 1020-5
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1954-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum antibodies, including ASCA, anti-OmpC, and ANCA, correlate with
      disease location and predict disease phenotype in inflammatory bowel disease.
      AIM: The objective of this study was to determine relationships between serum
      antibody status and anthropometric data for children with newly diagnosed Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on children diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease at our institution from 2003 to 2008. Patients who had ASCA IgA, 
      ASCA IgG, anti-OmpC, and pANCA antibodies, and anthropometric data measured
      before diagnosis and therapy were included. Z-scores for height and weight were
      compared among groups according to the presence of specific antibodies.
      Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess association between antibodies and
      growth data. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients, mean age 11.9 years, met the 
      inclusion criteria. Patients with the presence of any of the four antibodies had 
      lower mean height and weight z-scores than patients without any antibodies
      present. When individual antibodies were studied, patients with positive ASCA
      titers had lower mean weight and height z-scores than patients without any
      antibodies present. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient demonstrated a
      significant association between increasing ASCA titers and lower weight z-scores,
      but not lower height z-scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with newly
      diagnosed Crohn's disease and the presence of ASCA antibodies have lower mean
      height and weight z-scores. This study provides evidence that specific subsets of
      children with Crohn's disease may be at greater risk of growth impairment.

TI  - Impact of exclusive enteral nutrition on body composition and circulating
      micronutrients in plasma and erythrocytes of children with active Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1672-81
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21916 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is the primary treatment for active pediatric
      Crohn's disease (CD) in the UK/Europe, improving disease activity and
      anthropometry. This study assessed changes in micronutrient status during
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Seventeen children (male/female: 8/9;
      median age: 12.7 years) with active CD were treated exclusively for 6-8 weeks on 
      a polymeric feed (Modulen IBD; Nestle, UK). Body impedance was measured at
      baseline, during EEN, and posttreatment on normal diet and converted to z-scores 
      of fat and lean mass. Blood samples for nutrient analysis were collected from 13 
      children at baseline, end of EEN, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Lean but not fat
      mass improved at the end of EEN (initiation vs. end of EEN; fat mass [z-score]:
      -0.5 vs. -0.3; P = 0.141; lean mass [z-score]: -2.1 vs. -0.8; P < 0.0001). At
      baseline several children presented with suboptimal concentrations of
      carotenoids, trace elements, vitamin C, B6, and folate in plasma but not in
      erythrocytes. EEN improved concentrations for several nutrients, but more than
      90% of patients had depleted concentrations of all carotenoids. The latter
      improved on normal diet but other micronutrients, which improved during EEN,
      returned toward pretreatment concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Lean but not fat mass
      improved at the end of EEN. Median concentrations for several plasma
      micronutrients improved on EEN but carotenoids were depleted. These findings may 
      have implications for clinical practice and producers of enteral feeds. As plasma
      concentrations for many micronutrients can be affected by the acute phase
      response, measurements in erythrocytes may be a better marker of actual body
      stores.

      China in different periods].
PG  - 597-600
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To collect data and analyze the current status and prevalence changes 
      of Crohn's disease (CD) in mainland China in recent decades. METHODS: A
      computer-based literature search was previously performed by using 50-year (1950 
      to 2002) of records of CD from the Chinese Database of Biology and Medicine (CBM)
      (1979 to 2002) and a manual year-by-year search of the literature (1950 to 1978).
      Using similar method, descriptive epidemiological data from 2003 to 2007 were
      collected, analyzed and compared with previous research. RESULTS: Four hundred
      and seventeen relevant papers during 2003 and 2007 were collected and 62 papers
      were eligible for inclusion. Within 62 papers, a total of 2149 cases with CD from
      2003 to 2007 have been reported nationwide, comprising 1288 male and 861 female
      patients, with a 1.50:1 male predominance, and indicating 1.41 time of increment 
      as compared with our previous result (ie, 1526 cases from 1950 - 2002). There
      were no obvious changes in incidence age (younger and middle age were main
      components) and sex ratio (number of male was still larger than that of female). 
      The extrapolated CD incidence and prevalence rates were 1.21/100 000 person.year 
      and 2.29/100 000, respectively, which were higher than that of year 1950 - 2002, 
      0.28/100 000 person.year and 1.38/100 000, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The
      incidence and prevalence rates of CD have been increasing rapidly, but these
      rates are still lower than those in Western world.

      era of new technology.
PG  - 1407-17

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology behind
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) although the exact mechanism is far from fully
      understood. In the era of new technology, over the last years molecular
      approaches have shed light on the inflammatory mechanisms and their metabolic end
      products. This opens for a molecular fingerprinting that can be used in the
      biomarker field of IBD. There is a great need of biomarkers for prediction of
      clinical outcome and prognostic biomarker for prediction of therapeutic effects
      in IBD. Although the biomarker concept is old, so far very few really useful
      biomarkers exist in IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here, we review the predictive and
      prognostic biomarkers in IBD in the era of new technologies with emphasis on the 
      potential of molecular fingerprinting. RESULTS: Very few candidate biomarkers
      have been documented. The most promising candidate predictor is tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, but there is a lack of validation. CONCLUSION: So far, there are
      few biomarkers documented in IBD, but we are at the start of a new scientific
      field that will be of great value for the handling of the disease.

TI  - Glutamine and whey protein improve intestinal permeability and morphology in
      patients with Crohn's disease: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1000-12
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1947-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the
      etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD).
      Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP. AIM: We evaluated 
      the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD.
      METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in
      remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or 
      active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein,
      respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by 
      the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was
      performed by computerized image analysis system. RESULTS: Patients (age 34.5 +/- 
      10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen 
      patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and
      ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively,
      with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1%) patients in each group (P = 1.000).
      The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68
      (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR
      improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P =
      0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063). 
      VCR improved in the GG from 2.33 (0.77) to 2.68 (1.02) (P = 0.001), and in ACG
      from 2.26 (0.57) to 2.49 (0.67) (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal permeability
      and morphology improved significantly in both glutamine and ACG.

AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition is an effective yet often underused therapy for the
      induction of remission in pediatric Crohn disease. The North American Society for
      Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition formed the Enteral
      Nutrition Working Group to review the use of enteral nutrition therapy in
      pediatric Crohn disease. The group was composed of 5 pediatric
      gastroenterologists and 1 pediatric nutritionist, all with an interest and/or
      expertise in exclusive enteral nutrition. Specific attention was placed upon
      review of the evidence for efficacy of therapy, assessment of the variations in
      care, identification of barriers to its widespread use, and compilation of the
      necessary components for a successful program. The present guideline is intended 
      to aid physicians in developing an enteral nutrition therapy program and
      potentially promote its use.

AB  - BACKGROUND Several published studies have evaluated the efficacy of tacrolimus in
      the management of Crohn's disease with variable conclusions. AIM To review
      systematically the evidence examining the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in
      treating Crohn's disease. METHODS The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PUBMED) and EMBASE (1984 to January 2011) were
      searched. Also, references from selected articles were examined. Case series
      (five or more patients), cohort and randomised controlled trials were eligible
      for inclusion, incorporating oral, intravenous or topical tacrolimus therapy. The
      primary outcome was induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. RESULTS
      Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria which included 163 patients, of which
      127 received tacrolimus therapy. In patients with luminal Crohn's disease, the
      crude pooled remission rate for tacrolimus was 44.3% (range, 7-69%) and the crude
      pooled response rate was 37.1% (range, 14-57%). For patients with perianal
      disease using systemic tacrolimus, crude pooled remission rate was 28.6% (range, 
      0-64%) and crude pooled response rate was 38.8% (range, 0-57%). Combining data
      from two studies using topical tacrolimus, 35.7% of patients achieved remission
      and 28.6% partial response. Nonserious adverse effects are common, particularly
      tremor, paraesthesia and headache. Reversible nephrotoxity occurred in 16% of
      patients. CONCLUSIONS The current evidence; although of a poor quality, appears
      to support the use of tacrolimus in Crohn's disease. High quality randomised
      controlled trials are needed.

LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1936-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently published data indicate that the inflammation in Crohn's
      disease (CD) may be accompanied by elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases. 
      AIMS: The goals of the present study were the estimation of MMP-3 and -9
      concentrations in sera of children with Crohn's disease, the examination of
      correlation between the concentrations of MMP-3 and -9 and clinical activity of
      the disease in the relation to the control group and the evaluation of the
      utility of MMP-3 and -9 concentration measurements as markers of disease
      activity. METHODS: Serum concentrations of MMP-3 and -9 were estimated in 82
      children (45 CD patients divided into severe, moderate and mild subgroups; 37
      controls) and correlated with disease activity estimated by the Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), CRP, seromucoid and ESR. RESULTS: Mean MMP-3
      concentrations were: 2.49 ng/ml (95% CI: 1.76-3.52) for mild, 16.44 ng/ml (95%
      CI: 10.34-26.15) for moderate, 5.25 ng/ml (95% CI: 2.73-10.11) for severe CD and 
      1.95 ng/ml (95% CI: 1.53-2.48) for the control group (differences between all
      three groups were statistically significant; P < 0.001). Median MMP-9
      concentrations were: 2.14 ng/ml (95% CI: 0-8.9) for mild, 14.21 ng/ml (95% CI:
      4.53-21.48) for moderate, 42.2 ng/ml (95% CI: 5.74-61.27) for severe CD and 1.3
      ng/ml (95% CI: 0.7-2.18) for the control group. MMP-9 concentrations in moderate 
      and severe CD differed from the concentrations in mild CD (P = 0.002) and control
      group (P = 0.0001). MMP-3 concentration significantly correlated with MMP-9,
      PCDAI and ESR, while MMP-9 concentration significantly positively correlated with
      MMP-3, PCDAI, and CRP. Diagnostic utilities of the tests were: MMP-3 accuracy
      75%, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) = 4.11 and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) =
      0.51, sensitivity 56%, specificity 87%, Youden index 0.43; for MMP-9, accuracy
      73%, LR+ = 5.14 and LR- = 0.50, sensitivity 56%, specificity 89%, Youden index
      0.45; and for CRP, accuracy 74%, LR+ = 8.56 and LR- = 0.54, sensitivity 49%,
      specificity 94%, Youden index 0.43. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-9 serum concentration
      increasing along with the activity of the disease, exhibiting high specificity
      and correlating well with the indices of inflammation might be of better
      usefulness in the prediction of CD activity status in children than MMP-3.

      high cumulative doses.
PG  - 2326-32
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21626 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergo imaging using 
      ionizing radiation and may be exposed to high cumulative radiation. We
      hypothesized that children with IBD have high exposure to radiation from medical 
      imaging. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective
      chart review from 2002-2008 was performed on all patients with IBD. Radiographic 
      studies performed were recorded and exposure for each study was estimated.
      RESULTS: A total of 117 children with IBD (86 Crohn's disease [CD], 31 ulcerative
      colitis [UC]) were evaluated. The median current exposure was 15.1 mSv in CD and 
      7.2 mSv in UC (P = 0.005). Computed tomography (CT) scan and small bowel
      follow-through (SBFT) were responsible for 43% and 36% of all radiation
      exposures, respectively. The rate of radiation was higher in CD compared to UC
      (4.3 versus 2.2 mSv/yr). In CD, the rate of exposure was highest in the first 3
      years of diagnosis (8.2 mSv/yr), and no different between the 3-5 year follow-up 
      and 5+ year follow-up groups (3.8 versus 4.3 mSv/yr). Using the annual dose rate 
      in those followed for more than 3 years, an estimated 47 out of 78 (60%) children
      (40 CD, 7 UC) would exceed 50 mSv by 35 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation
      exposure from medical imaging is high in a subset of children diagnosed with IBD.
      Estimation of radiation exposure at age 35 suggests a significant portion of
      children with IBD will have high radiation exposure in their lifetime.
      Nonionizing imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound
      should be offered to children with IBD as an alternative to current imaging that 
      employs radiation.

      barrier function in an in vitro model.
PG  - 107-17
LID - 10.1007/s00535-011-0471-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diminished intestinal epithelial barrier function contributes to the 
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Clinical and experimental studies propose that
      increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha promotes barrier dysfunction. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the effects of nutritional and other therapies
      upon intestinal barrier function in the presence of TNF-alpha in an in vitro
      model. METHODS: Caco-2 monolayers were grown to confluence on membrane supports
      and then exposed to TNF-alpha in the presence of polymeric formula,
      hydrocortisone or infliximab. Monolayer permeability was evaluated by measuring
      epithelial resistance, short-circuit current and horseradish peroxidase flux in
      an Ussing chamber. Tight junction and myosin II regulatory light-chain kinase
      gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR, with protein expression and
      localization analysed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: TNF-alpha 
      increased monolayer permeability and diminished tight junction integrity. However
      both polymeric formula and infliximab completely abrogated the effects of
      TNF-alpha. These monolayers displayed unchanged permeability and tight junction
      integrity compared to untreated cells (media-no-TNF-alpha controls). In contrast,
      hydrocortisone only partially abrogated the effects of TNF-alpha, with these
      monolayers having increased permeability and altered tight junction integrity
      compared to media-no-TNF-alpha controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both polymeric formula and 
      infliximab completely prevent epithelial barrier dysfunction in the presence of
      TNF-alpha, whereas hydrocortisone partially prevents barrier dysfunction. These
      results provide evidence that superior mucosal healing can be achieved with both 
      polymeric formula and infliximab compared to hydrocortisone.

TI  - Clostridium difficile infection in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence and risk factors.
PG  - 844-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21837 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and microbiological data suggest that Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) plays a substantial role in the clinical initiation of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study was to investigate
      the prevalence and risk factors of CDI in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with
      IBD. METHODS: The current investigation was a retrospective study. All patients
      newly diagnosed with IBD in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic in Warsaw
      between 2007 and 2010 were included in the present study. The patients were
      diagnosed according to Porto criteria and microbiology evaluation screening tests
      for CDI were conducted. Risk factors including prior hospitalization, use of
      antibiotics within 2 months of CDI detection, colonic involvement, and the
      duration of symptoms were evaluated. CDI diagnosis was based on a positive stool 
      enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In the present study, 134 patients were evaluated
      (54 patients with Crohn's disease, and 80 with ulcerative colitis; 87% of the
      patients had colonic disease). The average age of the patients was 12.3 years,
      and the prevalence of CDI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-56%).
      Significant differences in the prevalence of CDI between patients with Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.72; odds ratio [OR] = 1.187, 95% CI,
      0.56-2.52) were not observed. The risk of CDI was associated with an increase in 
      the age of the patient and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The
      prevalence of CDI in newly diagnosed IBD patients was high and was independent of
      the type of disease.

TI  - No relation between disease activity measured by multiple methods and REE in
      childhood Crohn disease.
PG  - 271-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318236b19a [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increased resting energy expenditure (REE) unmatched by
      dietary intake is implicated as a cause of poor nutrition in childhood
      inflammatory conditions. Adequate description of disease activity and correction 
      of REE data for body composition are important to reach reliable conclusions
      about changes in REE associated with disease. The present study aimed to
      determine the effect of disease activity measured by clinical status, systemic
      and stool inflammatory markers on REE in children with Crohn disease using
      appropriate correction for confounding factors. METHODS: Sixty children with
      Crohn disease were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit
      and studied on 1 occasion. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Fat-free
      mass (FFM) was estimated by skinfold thickness. Disease activity was measured
      using systemic (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR])
      and faecal markers of inflammation (lactoferrin, calprotectin) and clinical
      scores (Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index). RESULTS: Using a multiple
      regression model, there was no significant change in REE from active or inactive 
      disease (beta = 0.03, P = 0.7) nor from CRP (beta = -0.05, P = 0.52), ESR (beta =
      -0.07, P = 0.43), faecal calprotectin (beta = -0.07, P = 0.38), and faecal
      lactoferrin (beta = 0.01, P = 0.88). REE/kg FFM was not associated with the
      Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (r = 0.1, P = 0.44), CRP (r = -0.3, P =
      0.84) or ESR (r = 0.12, P = 0.4), faecal calprotectin (r = 0.04, P = 0.97), or
      faecal lactoferrin (r = 0.02, P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: REE corrected for
      physiologically relevant confounders is not associated with degree of disease
      activity using clinical tools or systemic and local inflammatory markers, and
      therefore is an unlikely mechanism for poor nutritional state.

TI  - Cardiac involvement in inflammatory bowel disease: role of acylcarnitine esters.
PG  - e105-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular complications have been frequently described in
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Both Crohn disease and Ulcerative Colitis are
      characterized by malabsorption of some micronutrients, such as carnitine, which
      is a very important element for myocardial metabolism, being demonstrated that
      its deficiency correlates with heart involvement in coeliac disease. Aims of this
      study are to evaluate cardiac function in IBD patients asymptomatic for
      cardiovascular diseases and to correlate the cardiac data with the profile of
      carnitine esters plasma levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out 
      on 20 IBD patients by comparison with 18 sex- and age-matched clinically healthy 
      controls. Personal and familial history, physical examination, standard
      electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed in all subjects. Complete
      panel of nutritional status parameters and serum levels of free carnitine and its
      esters were evaluated both in IBD patients and control subjects. RESULTS:
      Isovaleryl-carnitine, Tiglyl-carnitine, Octenoylcarnitine and Decanoyl-carnitine,
      were found to be significantly lower in IBD patients. Significant correlations
      were found between some carnitine esters and echocardiographic parameters
      although total and free carnitine were meanly more elevated in IBD. No
      statistically significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were found 
      between IBD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of some
      isoforms of carnitine, especially those esterified with short chain fatty acids, 
      may play an important role in cardiac involvement in course of IBD and could
      lead, over time, to dilated cardiomiopathy.

TI  - Effect of adalimumab on work productivity and indirect costs in moderate to
      severe Crohn's disease: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 492-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of adalimumab on work productivity and indirect
      costs in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using a meta-analysis of clinical
      trials. METHODS: Study-level results were pooled from all clinical trials of
      adalimumab for moderate to severe CD in which work productivity outcomes were
      evaluated. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire outcomes
      (absenteeism, presenteeism and total work productivity impairment [TWPI]) were
      extracted from adalimumab trials. Meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled
      averages and 95% CIs of one-year accumulated reductions in work productivity
      impairment with adalimumab. Pooled averages were multiplied by the 2008 United
      States national average annual salary ($44,101) to estimate per-patient indirect 
      cost savings during the year following adalimumab initiation. RESULTS: The four
      included trials (ACCESS, CARE, CHOICE and EXTEND) represented a total of 1202
      employed adalimumab-treated patients at baseline. Each study followed patients
      for a minimum of 20 weeks. Pooled estimates (95% CIs) of one-year accumulated
      work productivity improvements were as follows: -9% (-10% to -7%) for
      absenteeism; -22% (-26% to -18%) for presenteeism; and -25% (-30% to -20%) for
      TWPI. Reductions in absenteeism and TWPI translated into per-patient indirect
      cost savings (95% CI) of $3,856 ($3,183 to $4,529) and $10,964 ($8,833 to
      $13,096), respectively. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab provided clinically meaningful
      improvements in work productivity among patients with moderate to severe CD,
      which may translate into substantial indirect cost savings from an employer's
      perspective.

TI  - Tolerance and efficacy of azathioprine in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2138-43
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21612 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiopurines are considered first-line immunomodulators for the
      prevention of relapse in moderate to severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Early
      introduction of thiopurines was shown in a pediatric trial to maintain
      steroid-free remission in 90% of patients for 18 months. In the present study we 
      analyzed the tolerance and efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) to maintain remission
      in a homogenous single-center observational cohort of children with CD. METHODS: 
      In all, 105 pediatric CD patients (male/female 68/37) were retrospectively
      evaluated for the efficacy of AZA (doses 1.4-4 mg/kg) to maintain remission at 6,
      12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up. Overall, 93 children were included with
      active disease (pediatric Crohn's disease activity index [PCDAI] >30),
      steroid/enteral-nutrition dependency, or postileocecal resection. Remission was
      defined as PCDAI </=10 without steroids. Patients requiring antitumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) medication, other immunomodulators, or surgery were considered to
      experience a relapse. RESULTS: Based on PCDAI, steroid-free remission was
      achieved in 56/93 (60.2%), 37/93 (39.8%), 31/93 (33.3%), and 29/93 (31.2%) at
      visits month (M)6, M12, M18, and M24, respectively. Within the first 4 weeks, AZA
      was stopped in 10/93 patients due to adverse reactions (pancreatitis, nausea,
      vomiting, skin reactions, general weakness), or not introduced due to low
      thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) activity (n = 3). No neutropenia occurred in
      patients with normal TPMT activity. Three infectious episodes were documented
      requiring temporary AZA suspension. CONCLUSIONS: AZA is efficacious in
      maintaining remission in pediatric CD patients, but to a lesser extent than
      previously suggested. The majority of patients who are in steroid-free remission 
      at 12 months remained in prolonged remission. Overall tolerance of AZA was
      excellent.

TI  - Distinguishing orofacial granulomatosis from crohn's disease: two separate
      disease entities?
PG  - 2109-15
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21599 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease
      of unknown etiology sharing histological features with Crohn's disease (CD). This
      study aimed to 1) define the clinical presentation of OFG, 2) establish
      differentiating features for those with CD, 3) examine if onset of OFG is
      predictive of CD, and 4) establish differentiating features for children.
      METHODS: Data were extracted from medical notes (n = 207) for demographics,
      clinical features, blood parameters, diagnosis of CD, and treatment's for
      patients with OFG. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients (47%) were female. The lips
      (184/203; 91%) and buccal mucosa (151/203; 74%) were mainly affected. Forty-six
      (22%) had intestinal CD. Ulcers (24/46; 46% versus 29/159; 15%, P = <0.001) were 
      more common in patients with CD as was a raised C-reactive protein (24/33; 73%
      versus 60/122; 49%, P = 0.016) and abnormal full blood count (19/41; 46% versus
      35/150; 23%). The buccal-sulcus (12/44; 27% versus 20/158; 13%, P = 0.019) was
      more often affected in those with CD. Half the patients with CD were diagnosed
      prior to onset of OFG. The remainder were diagnosed after. The incidence of CD is
      similar for children (16/69; 23%) and adults (29/132; 22%), although oral onset
      in childhood is more likely to occur prior to diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSIONS: OFG
      mainly presents in young adults with lip and buccal involvement. Abnormalities in
      inflammatory markers, hematology and oral features of ulceration, and
      buccal-sulcal involvement are factors more commonly associated with CD. Initial
      presentation of OFG does not necessarily predict development of CD, although this
      is more likely in childhood.

TI  - The role of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 in Crohn's disease:
      implications for therapeutic use of human growth hormone in pediatric patients.
PG  - 545-51
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32834a7810 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review evaluates the role of the growth hormone (GH) and 
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in influencing linear growth in pediatric
      Crohn's disease. It also examines the current evidence concerning the use of
      recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) as a potential therapy in achieving
      optimal growth and inducing mucosal healing for pediatric Crohn's disease. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Current treatment strategies for Crohn's disease including antitumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy have been demonstrated to improve
      growth velocity, but linear growth deficits persist despite optimization of
      therapy. By complex mechanisms, including the reduction of levels of IGF-1 and
      induction of systemic and hepatic GH resistance, cytokines such as TNF-alpha and 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), commonly elevated in active Crohn's disease, are important 
      as mediators of linear growth delay. Recent evidence suggests that rhGH therapy
      is effective in improving short-term linear growth for a selected group of
      patients but of limited benefit as a therapy for improving mucosal disease and
      reducing clinical disease activity. SUMMARY: Crohn's disease interacts with the
      GH-IGF-1 axis in important ways. Recent studies evaluating rhGH use in pediatric 
      Crohn's disease have demonstrated some efficacy in reversing persistent linear
      growth delay but limited benefits in terms of improving mucosal disease and
      clinical disease activity. Larger studies of adequate power are needed to confirm
      a true benefit in terms of growth, to examine a potential benefit with regard to 
      modification of disease activity, and to evaluate long-term risks.

TI  - NADPH oxidase complex and IBD candidate gene studies: identification of a rare
      variant in NCF2 that results in reduced binding to RAC2.
PG  - 1028-35
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex produces reactive oxygen species and
      plays a critical role in the killing of microbes by phagocytes. Genetic mutations
      in genes encoding components of the complex result in both X-linked and autosomal
      recessive forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Patients with CGD often
      develop intestinal inflammation that is histologically similar to Crohn's
      colitis, suggesting a common aetiology for both diseases. The aim of this study
      is to determine if polymorphisms in NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex genes that do not 
      cause CGD are associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). METHODS: Direct sequencing and candidate gene approaches were used to
      identify susceptibility loci in NADPH oxidase complex genes. Functional studies
      were carried out on identified variants. Novel findings were replicated in
      independent cohorts. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified a novel missense
      variant in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2) gene that is associated with 
      very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) and subsequently found in 4% of patients with
      VEO-IBD compared with 0.2% of controls (p=1.3x10(-5), OR 23.8 (95% CI 3.9 to
      142.5); Fisher exact test). This variant reduced binding of the NCF2 gene product
      p67(phox) to RAC2. This study found a novel genetic association of RAC2 with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and replicated the previously reported association of NCF4
      with ileal CD. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the rare novel p67(phox)
      variant results in partial inhibition of oxidase function and are associated with
      CD in a subgroup of patients with VEO-IBD; and suggest that components of the
      NADPH oxidase complex are associated with CD.

TI  - Diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease in
      Europe: results of a 5-year audit of the EUROKIDS registry.
PG  - 374-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318231d984 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2005, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working Group of the
      European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition
      published consensus guidelines on the diagnostic workup of paediatric IBD, the
      Porto criteria. According to these guidelines, children suspected of having IBD
      should undergo an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), ileocolonoscopy, and (except
      in cases of definitive ulcerative colitis) adequate imaging of the small bowel.
      To audit and evaluate the diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with IBD in
      Europe, the Working Group created EUROKIDS, a prospective, Web-based registry of 
      newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: Patients with IBD (ages
      0-18 years) were registered in 44 centres in 18 countries. Data on diagnostic
      workup were analysed according to the year of diagnosis, type of IBD, and centre 
      size. Diagnostic yield of OGD and ileal intubation were evaluated. RESULTS:
      Between 2004 and 2009, 2087 newly diagnosed patients were correctly registered.
      Both OGD and ileocolonoscopy had been performed in 64% of all of the patients and
      increased significantly from year 1 (52 %) to 5 (71%, P < 0.001). Small-bowel
      follow-through use decreased during the years (year 1 n = 213, year 5 n = 108; P 
      < 0.001), whereas magnetic resonance imaging use increased (year 1 n = 25, year 5
      n = 171; P < 0.001). Patients diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD, 59%) and
      ulcerative colitis (58%) were more likely to have had a complete diagnostic
      workup than patients diagnosed as having IBD unclassified (45%). In CD, the
      diagnostic yield of OGD was 7.5% and the yield of ileal intubation was 13%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The quality of diagnostic workup in paediatric patients with IBD
      increased steadily between 2004 and 2009. Small-bowel imaging by magnetic
      resonance imaging superseded the use of small-bowel follow-through. OGD and ileal
      intubation contributed to a definitive diagnosis of CD.

TI  - Crohn's disease patients with chronic intestinal failure receiving long-term
      parenteral nutrition: a cross-national adult study.
PG  - 931-40
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04806.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) is a very rare Crohn's disease (CD) 
      complication. AIM: To determine incidence of CIF treated with home parenteral
      nutrition (HPN) in adult CD patients and to isolate factors associated with
      severe CIF. METHODS: This retrospective multicentre study included 38 patients
      with CD-related CIF treated with HPN for at least 12 months in French HPN
      centres. Severe CIF was defined by a length of remnant small bowel of less than
      100 cm or CIF occurrence within the 15 years following CD diagnosis. RESULTS:
      Median delay between CD diagnosis and CIF was 15 years. CIF incidence did not
      decrease over time (1.4/year before 1995 vs. 2.2/year after). Median number of
      small bowel resections per patient was three (range 1-8). Median small bowel
      resection, remnant and initial lengths were 160, 80 and 260 cm, respectively.
      Twenty-four per cent of patients developed stenosis within 1 year after CD
      diagnosis and 76% developed perforative complications within 2 years. In
      multivariate analysis, severe CIF, defined as CIF onset <15 years after CD
      diagnosis, was associated with a more recent CD diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.785; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.623-0.989). CIF occurred despite frequent use of
      immunosuppressants. Course of CD remained severe during HPN: immunosuppressants
      prescription occurred in 11 patients, surgery in six. Six patients died from CD
      (n = 2), HPN complications (n = 2) or other causes (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic 
      intestinal failure requiring HPN is rare during CD. Incidence remained stable
      over time. Surgical procedures play a minor role in the occurrence of severe
      chronic intestinal failure compared to CD severity.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 571-80

AB  - The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively
      unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent
      and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First
      principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut
      whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with 
      short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors 
      the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of
      active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are
      accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple
      polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient
      evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the
      maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN
      reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in
      support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute
      flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the
      evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better 
      those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.

TI  - Increases in body mass index during infliximab therapy in patients with Crohn's
      disease: an open label prospective study.
PG  - 531-5
LID - 10.1016/j.cyto.2011.07.013 [doi]
AB  - In the past, the impact of infliximab therapy on nutritional status in patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD) has not been assessed. This prospective study was to
      investigate the effect of infliximab on nutritional status in CD patients. Fifty 
      consecutive patients with active CD received infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2
      and 6 as remission induction therapy, and then at 8 weeks intervals as
      maintenance therapy. Patients were followed for 60 weeks. CD activity index
      (CDAI) and body mass index (BMI) were monitored. A fall in CDAI by >/=70 was
      defined as response to therapy, while CDAI<150 meant clinical remission. At week 
      10, 39 patients (78%) responded to infliximab induction therapy. BMI
      significantly increased during these 10 weeks (P<0.0001). The mean increase in
      BMI was significantly higher in patients who responded to infliximab vs patients 
      who did not (P=0.03). Further, at weeks 30 and 60, 35 patients (70%) and 33 (66%)
      were in remission, respectively. The mean increase in BMI was significantly
      higher in patients who maintained remission vs patients not in remission (week
      30, P=0.02; week 60, P=0.01). Patients with a low baseline BMI (<18.5) and those 
      with small bowel involvement achieved a higher increase in BMI as compared to
      patients with BMI>/=18.5 or patients without small bowel involvement. In this
      study, infliximab therapy was associated with improvement of patients'
      nutritional status, notably patients who responded to this biologic.
      Additionally, in patients with malnutrition and small bowel involvement, the
      nutritional impact of infliximab was higher.

TI  - Aspirin in the aetiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a European
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 649-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04784.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin has detrimental effects on the gastrointestinal tract mucosa 
      and may play a role in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To
      investigate if the regular use of aspirin is associated with the development of
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using, for the first time, a
      prospective cohort study design. METHODS: A total of 135,780 men and women in
      Europe, aged 30-74years, were recruited into the European Prospective
      Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Participants completed
      questionnaires at baseline detailing their regular aspirin use and were then
      followed up to identify those who developed either incident CD or UC. Each case
      was matched with four controls and odds ratios (OR) were calculated, adjusting
      for cigarette smoking. Potential interactions between aspirin and smoking were
      assessed. RESULTS: A total of 35 participants developed CD and a further 84 were 
      diagnosed with UC. Regular aspirin intake was positively associated with the risk
      of developing CD (OR=6.14, 95% CI=1.76-21.35). In those who took aspirin and
      smoked there was no detectable increased risk of CD (OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-3.08). 
      No association was found between regular aspirin use and UC (OR=1.29, 95%
      CI=0.67-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: A strong positive association between regular aspirin
      use and CD, but not UC, was observed. The data suggest that regular aspirin use
      should be measured in epidemiological work on CD. If such findings are consistent
      in other work then aspirin may affect the development of CD in a middle-aged to
      elderly population.

TI  - Serum concentrations of VEGF and TGF-beta1 during exclusive enteral nutrition in 
      IBD.
PG  - 150-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182144c74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of
      treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however,
      its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study
      was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and
      adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents 
      with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 
      healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at 
      the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in
      controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the
      baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P
      < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05).
      During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased
      in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease
      remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD
      during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1
      concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group
      (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving
      remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor
      production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which
      possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: Is there a shift towards onset at a
      younger age?
PG  - 141-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318218be35 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are reported. To determine whether this 
      observation is a consequence of a shift towards onset at a younger age, we
      analysed retrospective data from patients enrolled in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study 
      (SIBDCS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SIBDCS is a disease-based cohort in
      Switzerland, which collects retrospective and prospective data on a large sample 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients, diagnosed from 1980,
      were stratified according to diagnosis of CD and UC. Age at disease onset (age at
      first symptoms and age at diagnosis) was analysed in relation to calendar year of
      disease onset. Data were extracted from physician and patient questionnaires.
      Linear regressions of age at disease onset by calendar year of disease onset
      adjusted by sex, country of birth, and education were performed. RESULTS:
      Adjusted regression coefficients for CD and UC were significantly positive, that 
      is, age at disease onset has increased with time. Male sex was associated with an
      increase in age at disease onset, and birth in Switzerland with a decrease. These
      associations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the
      SIBDCS do not support the hypothesis that disease onset of both CD and UC occur
      today at a younger age. On the contrary, our results show that there is a
      significant trend for age at disease onset occurring at an older age today as
      compared with recent decades. We conclude that the observation of increasing
      numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with IBD is not caused by a trend
      towards disease onset at a younger age, but that this may rather be a consequence
      of the overall increasing incidence of these conditions.

TI  - The effects of an oral supplement enriched with fish oil, prebiotics, and
      antioxidants on nutrition status in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 463-73
LID - 10.1177/0884533611413778 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) supports
      anti-inflammatory benefits of n-3 fatty acids from fish oil, prebiotics, and
      antioxidants. A nutritionally balanced inflammatory bowel disease nutrition
      formula (IBDNF) enriched with these compounds has the potential to improve
      nutrition status and disease activity in CD. METHODS: This is an open-label pilot
      study investigating the effects of IBDNF on nutrition status in CD patients.
      Twenty-eight patients with active CD on stable medication were asked to consume
      16 oz of IBDNF/d for 4 months. Nutrition status was assessed with dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry scans and serum micronutrient levels. Disease activity and
      quality of life were measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and
      the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Twenty patients
      completed the final visit. After 4 months, there was a significant decrease in
      plasma phospholipid levels of arachidonic acid with increases in eicosapentaenoic
      acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid. Ten patients had a final EPA concentration
      of >2%. There was improvement in fat-free and fat mass in patients with final EPA
      >2% (P = .014 and P = .05). Vitamin D (25-OH) levels improved in all patients
      (18.5-25.9 ng/mL, P < .001). Those with EPA >2% had significantly lower CDAI (116
      +/- 94.5 vs 261.8 +/- 86.5; P = .005) and higher IBDQ (179.1 +/- 26.6 vs 114.6
      +/- 35.9, P < .001) compared to those with EPA <2%. CONCLUSIONS: IBDNF has the
      potential to deposit fat-free and fat mass, improve vitamin D status, and improve
      quality of life in CD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in
      a well-defined population of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
      evaluate the common clinical and laboratory characteristics of individuals with
      IBD who developed HLH. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of all
      children who developed HLH over an 8-year period. The incidence of HLH in
      patients with IBD was calculated using US census data and a statewide project
      examining the epidemiology of pediatric IBD. RESULTS: Among children in
      Wisconsin, 20 cases of HLH occurred during the study period; 5 cases occurred in 
      children with IBD. Common characteristics include: Crohn's disease (CD),
      thiopurine administration, fever lasting more than 5 days, lymphadenopathy,
      splenomegaly, anemia, lymphopenia, and elevated serum triglycerides and ferritin.
      Of the patients, 4 had primary Epstein-Barr virus infections. The incidence of
      HLH among all children in Wisconsin was 1.5 per 100 000 per year. The risk was
      more than 100-fold greater for children with CD (P < .00001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Pediatric patients with CD are at increased risk for developing HLH; primary
      Epstein-Barr virus infection and thiopurine administration may be risk factors.

TI  - Mannan-binding lectin deficiency in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1275-8
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2011.594087 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Europe has
      increased significantly. At least a fourth of patients are children.
      Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is believed to be an important component of innate
      immunity, acting as an opsonin and activator of the lectin pathway (LP) of
      complement. The data relating any of the LP factors to IBD are sparse and
      contradictory and were obtained mainly from adult patients. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the possible role of MBL in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in children. METHODS: MBL2 gene single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) and MBL concentrations (ELISA) were determined. RESULTS:
      The frequency of MBL2 gene variants responsible for MBL deficiency (LXPA/O and
      O/O) is significantly higher in CD patients compared with controls or children
      with UC. A relatively high frequency of the codon 52 mutation (D allele) was
      noted in these patients. Practically no difference was found between UC and
      control (C) groups. Similarly, the average MBL levels as well as the number of
      MBL-deficient (MBL concentrations < 150 ng/ml) individuals differed between CD
      patients and controls or children suffering from UC. Again, there was no
      difference between UC and C groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBL
      deficiency may be associated with CD but not with UC in pediatric patients. The
      possible role of MBL in IBD requires confirmation in larger series and further
      investigation of the mechanisms involved.

TI  - [When to think about Crohn's disease when facing with chronic abdominal pain in
      children and adolescents?].
PG  - 643-7
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) together with ulcerative colitis (UC) and indeterminate
      colitis (IC) are the so called inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Epidemiological
      data show an increased incidence of both UC and CD and, especially in North
      America and in Europe, an increased prevalence of CD. European data show that
      northern countries present higher rates of IBD than southern ones. It is
      estimated that 15%-20% of CD patients experience onset of their symptoms under 20
      years of age. An increasing number of children enter disease before 8 years of
      age. The pathogenesis of CD has became more documented involving both the immune 
      system and changes in intestinal microbiota. Chronic abdominal pain associated
      with failure to thrive and inflammatory syndrome with or without intestinal
      transit disorders suggest CD. Onset of a anoperineal disease is also suggestive
      of CD and is a severity sign. The diagnosis is based on clinical history,
      physical examination, radiological studies, endoscopy, and histology. CD is
      defined by evidence of a discontinuous chronic inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract with or without granulomas and supported by clinical,
      biochemical, and radiological evidence. Treatment aims to reducing inflammation
      and restauring growth. Enteral feeding has become a key issue in allowing to
      avoid steroids. Immunosuppressive treatment based on azathioprine is increasingly
      used for maintaining remission. Anti-TNF treatment is a rescue therapy in case of
      refractory, frequently relapsing disease especially those with ano-perineal
      disease.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms that increase expression of the guanosine
      triphosphatase RAC1 are associated with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 633-41
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.04.057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: RAC1 is a guanosine triphosphatase that has an evolutionarily 
      conserved role in coordinating immune defenses, from plants to mammals. Chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with dysregulation of immune defenses.
      We studied the role of RAC1 in inflammatory bowel diseases using human genetic
      and functional studies and animal models of colitis. METHODS: We used a candidate
      gene approach to HapMap-Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery
      cohort; findings were confirmed in 2 additional cohorts. RAC1 messenger RNA
      expression was examined from peripheral blood cells of patients. Colitis was
      induced in mice with conditional disruption of Rac1 in phagocytes by
      administration of dextran sulfate sodium. RESULTS: We observed a genetic
      association between RAC1 with ulcerative colitis in a discovery cohort, 2
      independent replication cohorts, and in combined analysis for the single
      nucleotide polymorphisms rs10951982 (P(combined UC) = 3.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 
      1.43 [95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.63]) and rs4720672 (P(combined UC) = 4.7 x 
      10(-6), odds ratio = 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.58]). Patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease who had the rs10951982 risk allele had increased
      expression of RAC1 compared to those without this allele. Conditional disruption 
      of Rac1 in macrophage and neutrophils of mice protected against dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Human studies and knockout mice demonstrated
      a role for the guanosine triphosphatase RAC1 in the development of ulcerative
      colitis; increased expression of RAC1 was associated with susceptibility to
      colitis.

AB  - We present here two siblings with a history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers,
      neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations. The diagnosis of Behcet's
      disease in a context of familial aggregation was assumed. Facing repeated
      steroid-dependent flares and failure of maintenance therapies with colchicine and
      intolerance to pentoxifilline and disulone, adalimumab was started. Rapid
      response was observed in both patients, with clinical remission after induction
      therapy, which currently sustains under maintenance schedule. This case report
      suggests the effectiveness of adalimumab as first anti-TNFalpha in case of
      steroid-dependent/resistant gastrointestinal BD.

TI  - Postoperative infliximab is not associated with an increase in adverse events in 
      Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab is effective treatment for Crohn's disease and has been
      associated with rare, but serious infectious complications. Emerging data suggest
      a benefit of infliximab in preventing postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence.
      It is not known whether administration of infliximab shortly after resective
      surgery for Crohn's disease increases postoperative complications. AIMS: To
      evaluate the risk of developing postoperative complications among Crohn's disease
      patients receiving infliximab within 4 weeks of intestinal resection. METHODS: As
      part of a randomized placebo-controlled infliximab postoperative prevention
      study, adverse events were prospectively monitored. Crohn's disease patients
      undergoing intestinal resection were randomized to placebo or infliximab 2-4
      weeks after surgery. Study infusions were administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks then 
      every 8 weeks for 1 year. To evaluate whether infliximab increased postoperative 
      complications, we analyzed all adverse events for 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-four patients were randomized to infliximab or placebo after intestinal
      resection for Crohn's disease. Mean time to first postoperative infusion was 20
      days (range 14-25 days). Over the course of 1 year, there were 22 total adverse
      events, but no difference between infliximab and placebo patients (12 versus 10, 
      respectively, P = 1.0). In the immediate postoperative period, within 8 weeks of 
      surgery, the number of adverse events was also similar between the two groups (3 
      infliximab and 5 placebo patients, P = 0.68). There were no serious adverse
      events and no complications related to wound healing or infection. CONCLUSIONS:
      Initiation of infliximab within 4 weeks of intestinal resection was not
      associated with postoperative complications.

TI  - Thalidomide use and outcomes in pediatric patients with Crohn disease refractory 
      to infliximab and adalimumab.
PG  - 28-33
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318228349e [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate thalidomide as rescue therapy for
      pediatric patients with severe refractory Crohn disease (CD) who failed to
      respond to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      A computerized database was used to identify children with CD who had failed
      conventional immunosuppression therapy and received thalidomide rescue therapy.
      Twelve patients, mean age at diagnosis 10 years, were identified. Eight children 
      had disease localized to the ileum and colon and 4 to the gastroduodenal area and
      colon. Five cases were complicated by strictures and 7 by fistulae. Previous drug
      therapy included azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (11/12), methotrexate (7/12), and 
      anti-TNF biologics (12/12). Outcome measures were Harvey-Bradshaw Index, change
      in prednisone dose, hospitalizations, bowel resections, and incision and drainage
      procedures. Laboratory evaluations were calculated before and after 1 to 6 months
      of thalidomide. RESULTS: Mean Harvey-Bradshaw Index score improved from 11.8 to
      3.9 (P = 0.0004), mean prednisone dose decreased from 13.9 to 2.3 mg/day (P =
      0.001), mean number of hospitalizations decreased from 6.3 to 1.3 (P = 0.002),
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased from 35 to 14 mm/h (P = 0.02). The
      surgery rate pre-thalidomide was 0.031 and on thalidomide was 0.004. Of the 7
      patients with fistulae, 5 had complete fistula closure, 1 had partial closure,
      and 1 showed no improvement. Adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation
      of thalidomide are as follows: 42% peripheral neuropathy, 17% worsening of the
      CD, 8% dizziness, and 8% allergic reaction. All 5 patients who developed
      peripheral neuropathy had clinical resolution of the neurologic symptoms within 2
      to 3 months after stopping thalidomide. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide is a potentially
      effective rescue therapy for severe refractory CD in children who fail to respond
      to anti-TNF medications.

TI  - Novel characterization of drug-associated pancreatitis in children.
PG  - 423-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318228574e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medications are a major cause of acute pancreatitis;
      however, little is known about their influence in children. Our primary aims were
      to identify common comorbidities and concomitant pancreatitis etiologies in
      children with drug-associated pancreatitis. Our secondary aims were to identify
      the most commonly associated drugs in the different age groups, evaluate
      management practices, and compare drug-associated cases with non-drug-associated 
      cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we examined children (ages
      0-20 years) admitted to Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital with pancreatitis
      between 1994 and 2007. RESULTS: Of a total of 271 pediatric cases, drugs were
      associated with pancreatitis in 25.6% (55). The 3 most common comorbidities in
      children with drug-associated pancreatitis were seizure disorders, acute
      lymphocytic leukemia, and Crohn disease. One third of drug-associated cases had
      an additional pancreatitis etiology. The most commonly associated drugs were
      valproic acid and corticosteroids. Compared with non-drug-associated cases,
      children with drug-associated cases were more likely to undergo CT scanning
      (54.5% vs 28.4%; P < 0.001), stay in the hospital longer (10 vs 4 days; P <
      0.001), and transition to parenteral nutrition from a nil per os status (37.5% vs
      21.2%; P < 0.05). There was a higher frequency of valproic acid-associated cases 
      in children younger than 11 years (29.4% vs 9.5% in the 11- to 20-year-old age
      group). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of considering drugs as
      a cause and a contributor to pancreatitis in children, particularly valproic acid
      in young children.

TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

TI  - Plasma citrulline as surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation in pediatric and
      adolescent with Crohn's disease: preliminary report.
PG  - 1445-51
LID - 10.1007/s00384-011-1255-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several researchers have found that plasma citrulline could be a marker 
      of reduced enterocyte mass. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship 
      between plasma citrulline and bowel inflammation and/or disease location in
      pediatric and adolescent Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Between January 
      2008 and January 2010, 31 CD patients and 44 controls were included in our study,
      and 15 out of the 31 CD patients continued a prospective survey. We evaluated the
      differences between groups, at baseline, in plasma citrulline and glutamine and
      between their baseline and final values during the prospective survey, and
      correlation between baseline values of citrulline and duration of disease,
      C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: Mean citrulline value was
      33.0 +/- 7.5 mumol/L in controls and 23.5 +/- 8.4 mumol/L in CD patients (P <
      0.0001). Plasma citrulline was significantly lower in patients with small bowel
      (SB) location than in patient with only ileo-colon disease (14.2 +/- 5.5 and 24.7
      +/- 8.0, respectively; P = 0.0037). Citrulline </=22 mumol/L reached sensitivity 
      of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 54-100) and specificity of 98% (CI 89-99)
      in differentiating control subjects from CD with SB location. CONCLUSIONS: CD
      patients have reduced concentration of plasma citrulline than controls.
      Intestinal damage rather than inflammation seems to be responsible for the
      reduced biosynthesis of citrulline, which decreases particularly in CD patients
      with SB location. This finding suggests the potential role of citrulline as
      marker of disease location, but future works will be needed to confirm this
      suggestion.

TI  - Approaches to intestinal failure in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 336-41
LID - 10.1017/S0029665111000516 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is one of the leading causes of intestinal failure. The term
      'type 2' intestinal failure is used to describe the relatively rare type of
      intestinal failure that occurs in association with septic, metabolic and complex 
      nutritional complications, typically following surgical resection and/or
      laparostomy for intra-abdominal sepsis. A multidisciplinary approach to the
      management of patients with type 2 intestinal failure is crucial, and it is
      helpful to approach patient care in a structured manner using the
      'sepsis-nutrition-anatomy-plan' algorithm: resolution of sepsis is required
      before adequate nutritional repletion can be achieved, and it is crucial to
      optimise nutritional status, and define intestinal anatomy before delineating a
      definitive medical or surgical plan. A structured approach to the management of
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who have developed type 2 intestinal
      failure, should reduce the likelihood of these patients developing 'type 3'
      intestinal failure, which is characterised by the need for long-term parenteral
      nutrition. However, Crohn's disease is still the commonest indication for home
      parenteral nutrition in the UK.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often question their doctors about
      diet. The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing
      dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical
      societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD;
      listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and
      creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the
      existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from
      sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding 
      foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals,
      drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral
      supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat,
      reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice 
      exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease
      patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.

TI  - Association of TNFSF15 polymorphism with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1671-1677
LID - 10.1136/gut.2011.241877 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal
      disorder, affecting more than 10% of the general population worldwide. Although a
      genetic component is suspected, unambiguous susceptibility genes have so far not 
      been identified. This study tested the hypothesis that genes contributing to
      epithelial barrier integrity, control of mucosal immune responses and
      interactions with bacteria in the gut are associated with IBS. METHODS: Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to top signals of association with 
      Crohn's disease at 30 known susceptibility loci were tested for their effect on
      IBS risk in 1992 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts from
      Sweden and the USA. Association tests included a conservative Bonferroni
      correction for multiple comparisons, and were also performed on specific
      subgroups of patients characterised by constipation (IBS-C), diarrhoea (IBS-D) or
      alternating constipation and diarrhoea (IBS-A). RESULTS: The Crohn's disease risk
      allele rs4263839 G in the TNFSF15 gene was significantly associated with an
      increased risk of both IBS (p=2.2x10(-5); OR 1.37) and more pronouncedly, IBS-C
      (p=8.7x10(-7); OR 1.79) in the entire sample. Similar associations and risk
      effects of the same magnitude were observed in the two cohorts analysed
      separately. A correlation between rs4263839 genotype and TNFSF15 mRNA expression 
      was detected both in peripheral blood and in rectal mucosal biopsies from healthy
      individuals (combined p=0.0033). CONCLUSIONS: TNFSF15 is a susceptibility gene
      for IBS and IBS constipation. As TL1A, the protein encoded by TNFSF15,
      contributes to the modulation of inflammatory responses, the results support a
      role of immune activation in IBS.

AB  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis commonly affect women in their childbearing 
      years. Fortunately, advances in the field of inflammatory bowel disease have made
      successful pregnancy outcomes a reality for many women. These advances have led
      to family planning as a common discussion between gastroenterologists and
      inflammatory bowel disease patients. Common discussion topics are fertility,
      conception, medication safety, pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding although
      there are limited available data. Education and patient awareness have become
      vital factors in successful pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Combined azithromycin and metronidazole therapy is effective in inducing
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 222-6
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.01.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an aberrant response to the 
      gut microbiota. We aimed to assess whether azithromycin based therapy is
      effective in inducing remission in CD, due to its effect in inducing apoptosis
      and efficacy against biofilms and intracellular bacteria. METHODS: Retrospective 
      analysis of patients treated with an 8 week course of combined azithromycin and
      metronidazole. Patients were included if they had active CD defined as pediatric 
      CD activity index (PCDAI) >/= 10, and were not receiving any other medication for
      inducing remission in active disease. PCDAI score and CRP were recorded at
      baseline and 8 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: Thirty two patients (mean age 13.1 +/- 
      3.9, mean duration of disease 0.65 years) were included, of whom 21 (66%) entered
      clinical remission (PCDAI<10) after 8 weeks of treatment. The mean age at
      treatment and duration of disease did not differ between patients entering
      remission and those unresponsive to therapy. CRP, normalized in 54% of patients
      with elevated CRP at baseline. Factors associated with lack of response were a
      more severe disease (reflected by higher PCDAI and CRP values at baseline),
      presence of arthritis and extensive disease (ileocolonic, or prominent upper
      intestinal disease). CONCLUSIONS: An 8 week course of azithromycin and
      metronidazole therapy may be effective in inducing clinical remission in
      mild-moderate luminal CD in children and young adults.

AB  - Disease-associated undernutrition of all types is very common in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent weight loss remains one of the triad of 
      clinical manifestations and a cornerstone for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease
      (CD), although significantly fewer patients now present as being underweight.
      Recent evidence suggests that the introduction of medical treatment will quickly 
      restore body weight, although this does not reflect concomitant changes in body
      composition. CD children present with features of nutritional cachexia with
      normal fat stores but depleted lean mass. Poor bone health, delayed puberty and
      growth failure are additional features that further complicate clinical
      management. Suboptimal nutritional intake is a main determinant of
      undernutrition, although activation of the immune system and secretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines exert additional independent effects. Biochemically
      low concentrations of plasma micronutrients are commonly reported in IBD
      patients, although their interpretation is difficult in the presence of an acute 
      phase response and other indices of body stores adequacy are needed. Anaemia is a
      common extraintestinal manifestation of the IBD child. Iron-deficient anaemia is 
      the predominant type, with anaemia of chronic disease second. Decreased dietary
      intake, as a result of decreased appetite and food aversion, is the major cause
      of undernutrition in paediatric IBD. Altered energy and nutrient requirements,
      malabsorption and increased gastrointestinal losses are additional factors,
      although their contribution to undernutrition in paediatric CD needs to be
      studied further.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is an incurable intestinal disorder in which the loss of
      immune tolerance to the commensal gut microbiota leads to chronic inflammation.
      The reason this occurs in specific individuals is unclear; however, a genetic
      predisposition is fundamental and relatives of patients with CD are at
      significant risk of developing the disease. Knowledge relating to the genetic
      loci that predispose to CD is accumulating, which raises the possibility of
      disease prediction and prevention in susceptible populations. However, the
      genetic basis of CD is complex and genotyping alone is likely to be insufficient 
      to predict disease risk accurately. Specific physiological abnormalities
      associated with CD, such as increased intestinal permeability and raised faecal
      calprotectin, are also abnormal in some relatives of patients with CD. The
      combination of genotypic factors and biomarkers of risk makes the development of 
      models of disease prediction a realistic possibility. Furthermore, enhanced
      understanding of the genotype and phenotype of the at-risk state in relatives of 
      patients with CD allows the earliest stages in the pathogenesis of CD to be
      investigated and may allow intervention to prevent disease onset. This article
      reviews current knowledge of the at-risk phenotype in relatives of patients with 
      CD and focuses on the implications for the design of future studies.

TI  - Circulating microRNA is a biomarker of pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 26-33
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31822200cc [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of Crohn disease
      (CD) is endoscopy/colonoscopy, although this is invasive, costly, and associated 
      with risks to the patient. Recently, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged 
      as promising noninvasive biomarkers. Here, we examined the utility of serum
      miRNAs as biomarkers of CD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Studies were
      conducted using sera samples from patients with pediatric CD, healthy controls,
      and a comparison group of patients with pediatric celiac disease. Serum miRNA
      levels were explored initially using a microfluidic quantitative reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction array platform. Findings were
      subsequently validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction in larger validation sample sets. The diagnostic utility of
      CD-associated serum miRNA was examined using receiver operating characteristic
      analysis. RESULTS: A survey of miRNA levels in the sera of control and patients
      with CD detected significant elevation of 24 miRNAs, 11 of which were chosen for 
      further validation. All of the candidate biomarker miRNAs were confirmed in an
      independent CD sample set (n = 46). To explore the specificity of the
      CD-associated miRNAs, they were measured in the sera of patients with celiac
      disease (n = 12); none were changed compared with healthy controls. Receiver
      operating characteristic analyses revealed that serum miRNAs have promising
      diagnostic utility, with sensitivities for CD above 80%. Significant decreases in
      serum miRNAs were observed in 24 incident patients with pediatric CD after 6
      months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies 11 CD-associated
      serum miRNA with encouraging diagnostic potential. Our findings suggest serum
      miRNAs may prove useful as noninvasive biomarkers in CD.

AB  - In the West, the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases has
      increased in the past 50 years, up to 8-14/100,000 and 120-200/100,000 persons,
      respectively, for ulcerative colitis (UC) and 6-15/100,000 and 50-200/100,000
      persons, respectively, for Crohn's disease (CD). Studies of migrant populations
      and populations of developing countries demonstrated a recent, slow increase in
      the incidence of UC, whereas that of CD remained low, but CD incidence eventually
      increased to the level of UC. CD and UC are incurable; they begin in young
      adulthood and continue throughout life. The anatomic evolution of CD has been
      determined from studies of postoperative recurrence; CD begins with aphthous
      ulcers that develop into strictures or fistulas. Lesions usually arise in a
      single digestive segment; this site tends to be stable over time. Strictures and 
      fistulas are more frequent in patients with ileal disease, whereas Crohn's
      colitis remains uncomplicated for many years. Among patients with CD, intestinal 
      surgery is required for as many as 80% and a permanent stoma required in more
      than 10%. In patients with UC, the lesions usually remain superficial and extend 
      proximally; colectomy is required for 10%-30% of patients. Prognosis is difficult
      to determine. The mortality of patients with UC is not greater than that of the
      population, but patients with CD have greater mortality than the population. It
      has been proposed that only aggressive therapeutic approaches, based on treatment
      of early recurrent lesions in asymptomatic individuals, have a significant impact
      on progression of these chronic diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal
      tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs 
      in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is
      unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition,
      environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted 
      a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What
      are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's 
      disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain
      remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of
      surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's
      disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in
      adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What
      are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with
      Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other
      important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety
      of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics,
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral
      nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental
      colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

PG  - 592-7
LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2011.03.025 [doi]
AB  - Various genes that may influence the intestinal barrier have been identified,
      including MAGI2, PARD3, and MYO9B. These genes are associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) in several European studies. A total of 2,049 individuals
      (656 Crohn's disease [CD], 544 ulcerative colitis [UC], and 849 controls) were
      genotyped and association studies were performed for 1 single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) in MAGI2, 1 SNP in PARD3, and 6 SNPs in MYO9B. We reported an 
      association between 3 SNPs in MYO9B and ileal involvement with rs1457092 as the
      most significant SNP (p = 0.0073, odds ratio [OR] 0.69 [95% confidence interval
      (95% CI) 0.52-0.90]). The nonsynonymous SNP rs1545620 exhibited a p value of
      0.014, OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.55-0.93). MYO9B was not associated with UC. MAGI2 or
      PARD3 was not associated with IBD. A 6-SNP haplotype block in MYO9B demonstrated 
      association with CD and ileal CD (p = 0.0030 and 0.0065, respectively). These
      data demonstrate an association of MYO9B with ileal CD; however, there was no
      association of MAGI2 and PARD3 with IBD. Because the direction of association of 
      MYO9B in this Canadian study was not consistent with European studies, further
      studies are needed to elucidate the role of MYO9B in IBD.

TI  - The efficacy of exclusive nutritional therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease,
      comparing fractionated oral vs. continuous enteral feeding.
PG  - 1332-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy has an established role as induction therapy in
      paediatric Crohn's disease. However, compliance is the main difficulty and may be
      greatly influenced by the administration route. AIM: To analyse the efficiency of
      exclusive nutrition to induce remission in children with Crohn's disease
      comparing fractionated oral vs. continuous enteral feeding. METHODS: The medical 
      records of 106 patients treated by exclusive nutritional therapy [Modulen IBD
      (R)] by either oral or continuous enteral route were reviewed retrospectively.
      Comparative analyses of remission rates, changes in anthropometry, Paediatric
      Crohn's disease Activity Index (PCDAI), laboratory indices and compliance rates
      were performed. RESULTS: On exclusive enteral nutrition, at 8 weeks, 34/45
      patients achieved remission in the oral group (75% on intention-to-treat
      analysis) and 52/61 (85%) in the enteral nutrition group (P = 0.157). All
      patients showed a significant decrease in disease severity assessed by PCDAI (P <
      0.0001) and significant improvements in anthropometric measures and inflammatory 
      indices. No difference was observed whether Modulen IBD was administered orally
      or by continuous enteral feeding, apart from weight gain, which was greater in
      the enteral group (P = 0.041). In a subgroup of patients, mucosal healing was
      evidenced on follow-up endoscopies showing a clear correlation to remission.
      Compliance rates (87% and 90%) were similar. Nevertheless, noncompliant patients 
      had lower mucosal healing and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: These retrospective
      data suggest that the use of fractionated oral nutritional therapy might be as
      efficacious as continuous enteral administration to induce remission and mucosal 
      healing in children with Crohn's disease. However, appropriate prospective
      clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Varicella immunity in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 386-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31821e1917 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Varicella zoster is a childhood disease that can cause devastating
      illness and death in immunocompromised individuals, including those who are
      taking steroids. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is managed by decreasing or
      controlling the inflammation using immunosuppression. Our objective was to show
      that at least 90% of patients newly diagnosed as having IBD had antibodies
      against varicella zoster and were protected by vaccination or natural disease.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all of the charts of the patients 
      diagnosed with IBD at the University of Buffalo's Digestive Diseases and
      Nutrition Center for 5 years from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. RESULTS: 
      There were 163 new diagnoses of IBD during this time; 57% were boys. Mean age was
      12 years (range 1-19 years); 62% had Crohn disease, 33% ulcerative colitis, and
      5% indeterminate colitis. A total of 66% of all of the patients had a history of 
      disease or vaccination. Measurable titers against varicella were found in only
      77% of all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of varicella immunity is common in 
      children and adolescents at the time of diagnosis of IBD. Routine screening for
      varicella immune status may be warranted. Offering immunization to susceptible
      patients should confer protection, but this may be difficult to achieve once
      immune suppression has begun.

TI  - Nutritional modulation of the inflammatory bowel response.
PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1159/000323456 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The
      corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment 
      for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. 
      Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various
      chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and
      the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of
      reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of
      the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional
      treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote 
      the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify
      the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction.
      Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a
      significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional
      components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to
      present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the
      management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Association of vitamin K deficiency with bone metabolism and clinical disease
      activity in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1023-8
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2010.10.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process in 
      the digestive tract and patients with IBD develop osteopenia. Although vitamins K
      and D are important for maintaining bone health and inhibiting inflammation,
      their roles in patients with IBD are not clear. We investigated the roles of
      vitamins K and D in the bone health and inflammation in patients with IBD.
      METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD], n
      = 47, and ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 40) was measured with dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. Vitamin K and D levels of patients with IBD and healthy
      volunteers (n = 41) were evaluated by measuring serum undercarboxylated
      osteocalcin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, respectively. Clinical activity index
      was evaluated in patients with CD and UC. RESULTS: BMD was low in patients with
      CD and UC. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were significantly higher
      in patients with CD, but not with UC, compared with healthy subjects, indicating 
      that bone vitamin K is insufficient in patients with CD. The levels of
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin were significantly correlated with the clinical
      activity index of CD, although they were not correlated with BMD. The levels of
      1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly lower in patients with CD and UC than 
      in healthy subjects. The levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were inversely
      correlated with BMD in patients with UC and were not correlated with the clinical
      activity index of CD. CONCLUSION: Vitamins K and D are insufficient in patients
      with IBD. Insufficiency of vitamin K is suggested to be associated with
      inflammatory processes of CD.

TI  - Idiopathic pancreatitis preceding the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is 
      more frequent in pediatric patients.
PG  - 714-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182065cad [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be a rare extraintestinal 
      manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are only a few reports
      of AP presenting before the diagnosis of IBD. We aimed to characterize the
      demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients with IBD in whom AP
      preceded disease onset and compare the presentation of AP between children and
      adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric and adult patients presenting with AP as 
      the first symptom of IBD were retrospectively identified (10 years, 7 university 
      hospitals). Demographic and clinical data, IBD type, disease extension, and
      laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Imaging methods, number of AP
      episodes, and lag time between onset of first pancreatitis episode and onset of
      IBD were recorded. RESULTS: AP preceding the diagnosis of IBD was found in 10 in 
      460 pediatric patients with IBD (2.17%), compared with only 2 in 3500 adults
      (0.06%). Eight children had colonic disease (4 Crohn disease, 4 ulcerative
      colitis [3 pancolitis]). Mean amylase level was 1419 and range 100 to 1370. Three
      children (30%) had mildly elevated transaminases. Median time between onset of
      first episode of AP in relation to onset of IBD was 24 (range 1-156) weeks. AP
      most commonly presented with abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: IBD presenting as AP
      was more frequent among the pediatric population with IBD in comparison to
      adults. It was more common in patients with colitis than in those with ileal
      disease, suggesting that patients with idiopathic AP should be observed carefully
      for a possible diagnosis of IBD.

      Crohn's disease: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1929-36
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1671-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of use of azathioprine (Aza) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
      for maintaining remission for Crohn's disease is debatable. AIM: To examine
      whether Aza/6-MP can be safely withdrawn in patients with Crohn's disease who
      have been in remission. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE
      (1950-September 2010), EMBASE (1980-September 2010), CINHAL (1981-September
      2010), PubMed (1950-September 2010), and the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomised controlled and cohort studies comparing
      azathioprine continuation versus placebo or no treatment were eligible for
      inclusion. Primary outcomes were relapse rate after discontinuation of Aza/6-MP
      at 6, 12, and 18 months, and 5 and 10 years. RESULTS: Five studies, with 256
      patients and 168 controls, met the inclusion criteria. Stopping azathioprine/6-MP
      was found to significantly increase the risk of relapse at 6, 12, and 18 months
      with pooled odds ratios of 0.22 (95% CI 0.09-0.53), 0.25 (95% CI 0.11-0.56), and 
      0.35 (95% CI 0.21-0.6), respectively. Two trials examined relapse rate at 5 years
      with pooled OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.13-2.21). No trials looking at relapse rates beyond
      5 years were identified. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear benefit of continuing
      Aza/6-MP for at least 18 months to maintain remission for Crohn's disease
      patients who established remission. There is not enough evidence to provide clear
      guidance on whether or not to continue Aza/6-MP treatment beyond 18 months.
      Well-designed randomised controlled trials addressing this issue are needed.

TI  - A preliminary trial of the effect of recombinant human growth hormone on
      short-term linear growth and glucose homeostasis in children with Crohn's
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH)
      improves linear growth in children with Crohn's disease (CD). AIMS: To
      investigate the effects of rhGH on height velocity (HV) and glucose homeostasis
      over a 6-month period. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled trial in two
      tertiary children's hospitals in 22 children with inflammatory bowel disease
      amongst whom 21 had CD. Duration of disease from diagnosis and number of acute
      relapses requiring either exclusive enteral nutrition or therapeutic dose of oral
      prednisolone were similar in the treatment and control groups. INTERVENTION:
      Either rhGH (0.067 mg/kg per day) as daily subcutaneous injections (rhGH group;
      n, 11) or no rhGH, (Ctrl; n, 11) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage
      change in HV after 6 months in the two groups. Auxology, puberty, skeletal age,
      disease factors, treatment and glucose homeostasis were also assessed. RESULTS:
      Median HV increased from 4.5 (range, 0.6, 8.9) at baseline to 10.8 (6.1, 15.0)
      cm/year at 6 month (P = 0.003) in the rhGH group, whereas in the Ctrl group, it
      was 3.8 (1.4, 6.7) and 3.5 cm/year (2.0, 9.6), respectively (P = 0.58). Median
      percentage increase in HV after 6 months in the rhGH group was 140% (16.7, 916.7)
      compared with 17.4% (-42.1%, 97.7%) in the Ctrl group (P < 0.001). There were no 
      significant differences in disease activity and proinflammatory cytokines at
      baseline and 6 months in both groups and change in bone age for chronological age
      was also similar in the two groups. In the rhGH group, fasting insulin increased 
      from 4.0 (2.0, 11.0) to 7.0 mU/l (2.0, 16.0) (P = 0.02), whereas in the Ctrl
      group, it was 3.0 (1.2, 12.7) and 3.8 mU/l (2.1, 7.0) (P = 0.72), respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although this pilot trial shows that rhGH can improve short-term
      linear growth in children with CD, the clinical efficacy of this therapy needs to
      be further studied in longer-term studies of growth, glucose homeostasis and
      disease status.

TI  - [Comparison between staged surgery and one-stage surgery in active complex Crohn 
      disease].
PG  - 171-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the prognosis between staged surgery and one-stage surgery 
      in active complex Crohn disease(CD). METHODS: Clinical data of 33 patients with
      active complex CD from February 2006 to September 2010 were analyzed
      retrospectively. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who were diagnosed with CD by
      pathology or endoscopy with CD activity index(CDAI)>220 and long history of
      preoperative steroid use(over 6 months), or complicated with severe preoperative 
      malnutrition. The indications for surgery included enterocutaneous or entero
      enteric fistula, with/without intra-abdominal abscess, intestinal obstruction,
      and acute intestinal perforation intra-abdominal sepsis. The surgical procedures,
      including staged surgery and one-stage definite surgery were chosen by
      experienced surgeons. All the patients quit smoking and received
      immunosuppressant therapy (TwHF or azathioprine) together with enteral nutrition 
      supplement for preventing postoperative recurrence. All the patients were
      followed up after the surgery with regards to CDAI, serum C-reactive protein
      (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Postoperative complications,
      clinical and endoscopic recurrence were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients, 14
      underwent one-stage definite surgery and 19 received staged surgery.
      Postoperative complication rates in the two groups were 71% and 26%
      respectively(P=0.015). The early clinical recurrence rates within postoperative 3
      months were 36% and 0(P=0.008). In regard to cumulative probability of
      post-operative clinical and endoscopic recurrence, staged surgery group was
      superior to one stage definite surgery group(P=0.000 and 0.006). CONCLUSION:
      Staged surgery may significantly increase the success rate of operation, reduce
      postoperative complications and postoperative early relapse, and decrease
      postoperative recurrence.

AB  - We present a 36-year-old female diagnosed with Crohn's disease at the age of 11
      years. In 2001, she underwent a total colectomy and further small bowel resection
      as a result of active Crohn's. Her residual anatomy consisted of 150 cm of small 
      bowel to an end jejunostomy. Subsequently, she developed short bowel syndrome
      with recurrent episodes of hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypokalaemia.
      Dietetic assessment revealed her to be severely underweight at 37 kg with a
      bodymass index (BMI) of 14.4 kg/m(2) . During her admission, our patient
      underwent psychiatric assessment and was established on home parenteral nutrition
      (HPN). At the time of discharge, 1 month later, her weight had increased to 44 kg
      (BMI = 17.7 kg/m(2) ). Over the following 12-month period, she lost weight (BMI, 
      15.4 mg/m(2) ; weight, 39.5 kg) and she described a high stoma output (up to 17
      L) and dehydration. Assessment of her oral intake found she was consuming an
      estimated 14,000 kcal and 600 g protein per day. At this time, the possibility of
      a new form of eating disorder was discussed with the patient and she agreed that 
      her behavior i.e., using her stoma as a purging device, fulfilled the criteria
      for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and she was referred to a specialist eating
      disorder unit.

      double-blind randomized controlled trial with two years follow-up.
PG  - 246-53
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of an elemental formula (EF) to a
      polymeric formula (PF) in inducing remission for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). 
      METHODS: Newly diagnosed CD children were randomized to EF or PF for 6 weeks.
      Change in the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), fecal
      calprotectin, and plasma fatty acids were measured at 0 and 6 weeks. Patients
      were followed up for 2 years. Time and treatment choice for first relapse were
      documented. RESULTS: Thirty-four children completed the study; EF: 15 (7 M, 8 F),
      PF: 19 (13 M, 6 F). The mean age was (years) EF: 12.6, PF: 11.7. Ninety-three
      percent of children (14/15) achieved remission in the EF group and 79% (15/19) in
      the PF group. One-third of patients maintained remission for 2 years. Mean time
      to relapse (days); EF: 183 (63-286), PF: 162 (53-301). Most children who relapsed
      used feed as a treatment for that relapse (EF: 9/10 and PF: 8/13). With PF, an
      increase of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and alpha linolenic acid was found with a 
      reciprocal decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). With EF, AA and EPA levels were
      reduced with a significant decrease in docosahexaenoic acid. Fecal calprotectin
      measurements decreased significantly but did not normalize at the end of week 6. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between EF and PF in inducing
      remission. One-third of children maintained remission. Changes in plasma
      polyunsaturated fatty acid status were subtle and may be relevant; however,
      further evaluation is recommended.

TI  - Laparoscopic ileocecectomy in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 193-5
LID - 10.1089/lap.2010.0169 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Definitive management for medically refractory ileocecal Crohn's
      disease is resection with primary anastomosis. Laparoscopic resection has been
      demonstrated to be effective in adults. There is a relative paucity of data in
      the pediatric population. We therefore audited our experience with laparoscopic
      ileocecectomy in patients with medically refractory ileocecal Crohn's disease to 
      determine its efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all
      pediatric patients who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection for medically
      refractory Crohn's disease at a single institution from 2000 to 2009. RESULTS:
      Thirty patients aged 10-18 years (mean: 15.3 years) with a mean weight of 50 kg
      (standard deviation: +/- 15.5 kg) underwent laparoscopic ileocecectomy for
      Crohn's disease. Five of these were performed using a single-incision
      laparoscopic approach. The indications for surgery were obstruction/stricture
      (21), pain (10), abscess (3), fistula (3), perforation (2), and bleeding (1).
      Some patient's had multiple indications. There were a total of five abscesses
      encountered at operation. Eight patients were on total parenteral nutrition at
      the time of resection. Twenty-five patients (83.3%) were being treated with
      steroids at operation. The anastomosis was stapled in 26 patients and hand-sewn
      in 4. Two patients developed a postoperative abscess, and both of them were
      taking 20 mg of prednisone daily. One patient developed a small bowel obstruction
      due to a second Crohn's stricture that manifested itself after the more severe
      downstream obstruction was relieved with ileocecectomy. Of the 5 patients who
      underwent a single-incision laparoscopic operation, 3 underwent for
      obstruction/stricture and 2 for perforation. There were no intraoperative or
      postoperative complications. The patients were followed up for a maximum of 80.7 
      months (average: 14.7 months; median: 9.7 months). There were no anastomotic
      leaks or wound infections. DISCUSSION: This series demonstrates that laparoscopic
      ileocecectomy, both single-incision laparoscopic approach and standard
      laparoscopy, is safe and effective in the setting of medically refractory Crohn's
      disease in pediatric patients.

      lymphocyte expansion in Nod2 deficient mice.
PG  - 2443-55
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21672 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ileal involvement in Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with NOD2
      mutations and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies
      (GM-CSF Ab), and GM-CSF blockade promotes ileitis in Nod2/Card15-deficient
      (C15KO) mice. RALDH2-expressing dendritic cells (DC) and IL-4 promote CCR9
      imprinting and small bowel homing of T lymphocytes, in conjunction with CCL25
      expression by ileal epithelial cells (IEC). We hypothesized that GM-CSF
      neutralization promotes ileal disease by modulating expression of CCL25 by IEC
      and CCR9 by T lymphocytes via Nod2-dependent and independent pathways. METHODS:
      CCL25 and CCR9 expression were determined in pediatric CD patients stratified by 
      GM-CSF Ab. Ileitis was induced in C15KO mice via GM-CSF Ab administration
      followed by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure, and expression
      of CCL25, CCR9, FOXP3, intracellular cytokines, and RALDH2 was determined in IEC 
      and immune cell populations. RESULTS: The frequency of CCL25(+) IEC and CCR9(+) T
      lymphocytes was increased in CD patients with elevated GM-CSF Ab. In the murine
      model, GM-CSF blockade alone induced IEC CCL25 expression, and reduced the
      frequency of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) CD4(+) FOXP3(+) cells, while Card15
      deficiency alone enhanced MLN DC RALDH2 expression. Both GM-CSF neutralization
      and Card15 deficiency were required for downregulation of MLN DC IL-10
      expression; under these conditions NSAID exposure led to an expansion of IL-4(+) 
      and IL-17(+) CCR9(+) lymphocytes in the ileum. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF prevents ileal
      expansion of CCR9(+) lymphocytes via Nod2-dependent and independent pathways.
      CCR9 blockade may be beneficial in CD patients with elevated GM-CSF Ab.

TI  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: increasing incidence, decreasing surgery
      rate, and compromised nutritional status: A prospective population-based cohort
      study 2007-2009.
PG  - 2541-50
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the incidence, treatment, surgery rate, and
      anthropometry at diagnosis of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      METHODS: Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 in
      Eastern Denmark, Funen, and Aarhus were included from a background population of 
      668,056 children <15 years of age. For evaluation of incidence, treatment, and
      surgery rate, a subcohort from Eastern Denmark was extracted for comparison with 
      a previously published population-based cohort from the same geographical area
      (1998-2006). RESULTS: In all, 130 children with IBD: 65 with Crohn's disease
      (CD), 62 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and three with IBD unclassified (IBDU)
      were included. The mean incidence rates per 10(6) in 2007-2009 were: IBD: 6.4
      (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4-7.7), CD: 3.2 (2.5-4.1), UC: 3.1 (2.4-4.0) and
      IBDU: 0.2 (0.05-0.5). Comparing the two cohorts from Eastern Denmark we found
      higher incidence rates for IBD (5.0 and 7.2 in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009,
      respectively, P = 0.02) and CD (2.3 versus 3.3, P = 0.04). Furthermore, we found 
      a significant decrease in surgery rates (15.8/100 person-years versus 4.2, P =
      0.02) and an increase in the rate of initiating immunomodulators (IM) within the 
      first year (29.0/100 person-years versus 69.2, P < 0.001). IM use was associated 
      with a trend towards a decreased surgery risk (relative risk [RR] 0.38;
      0.15-1.0). Children with CD had poor nutritional status at diagnosis compared
      with the general pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 12 years we
      found an increase in the incidence of IBD in children, an increasing use of IM,
      and decreasing 1-year surgery rates. CD patients had poor nutritional status.

TI  - The effect of IL-10 genetic variation and interleukin 10 serum levels on Crohn's 
      disease susceptibility in a New Zealand population.
PG  - 431-5
LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2011.02.014 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin (IL)-10 has important effects in immunoregulation and inflammation,
      and previous studies have provided evidence for the involvement of IL-10 in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). In this study, we investigated whether
      genetic variants of the IL-10 gene were associated with CD in a New Zealand
      population. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region
      of IL-10 (rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896) and a flanking SNP, rs3024505,
      were genotyped in a well-characterized New Zealand dataset consisting of 342 CD
      cases and 610 controls. Furthermore, we measured serum IL-10 levels in a number
      of the CD patients and controls and examined whether a relationship existed
      between these polymorphisms and serum IL-10 levels. We demonstrated an
      association with CD for SNPs rs3024505 and rs1800896, and phenotypic analysis
      indicated an association of rs3024505 with an early age at first diagnosis,
      stricturing CD behavior, and requirement for bowel resection. We also observed
      that IL-10 concentration was significantly higher in CD patients than in the
      controls and that the T allele of rs1800896, the A allele of rs1800871, and the T
      allele of rs1800872 were associated with increased serum IL-10 levels.

TI  - Clinical course of Crohn's disease following treatment of lymphoma.
PG  - 1265-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) patients may be at increased risk for the
      development of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), either
      through exposure to immunosuppressive medications or due to their underlying
      chronic inflammatory illness. There are limited data regarding the natural
      history of CD following treatment of lymphoma. We present a series of CD patients
      who were treated for lymphoma and describe the natural history of their CD
      following lymphoma treatment. METHODS: Retrospective case series from three
      academic referral centers was used. All CD patients with a history of lymphoma
      were identified. Demographic data, CD medication exposure, and surgical
      procedures before and after lymphoma treatment were recorded. RESULTS: Nine CD
      patients with a history of lymphoma were identified. Eight individuals received
      chemotherapy, while one patient was observed without treatment. Eight patients
      remained free of lymphoma for a mean of 72.8 months (range 1-276 months). The
      ninth patient had recurrence of his HL 3 years after lymphoma diagnosis.
      Following lymphoma treatment, two patients had quiescent CD with no specific
      therapy. Three patients demonstrated significant clinical relapse of their CD and
      a fourth patient developed CD after treatment of her lymphoma, which ultimately
      required long-term immunomodulator therapy with 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate 
      in the first three patients, and azathioprine in the fourth. Four patients
      required CD surgery after lymphoma treatment. CONCLUSION: We report on the
      clinical course of CD in patients who develop lymphoma. Significant clinical
      relapse of CD following successful medical treatment of lymphoma occurred
      frequently in patients with a history of this neoplasm.

TI  - Innate dysfunction promotes linear growth failure in pediatric Crohn's disease
      and growth hormone resistance in murine ileitis.
PG  - 236-45
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth failure remains a common complication of pediatric Crohn's
      disease (CD) and has been associated with small bowel involvement and need for
      surgery. We have reported that patients with elevated (>/= 1.6 mug/mL)
      granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies (GM-CSF Ab) are
      more likely to experience complicated ileal disease requiring surgery. We
      hypothesized that concurrent GM-CSF Ab and CARD15 risk allele carriage (C15(+)
      GMAb(+) ) would be associated with growth failure in CD and growth hormone (GH)
      resistance in murine ileitis. METHODS: We enrolled 229 pediatric CD patients at
      two sites and determined CARD15 genotype, serum GM-CSF Ab, and GH binding protein
      (GHBP), and height (HTz) and weight (WTz) z-scores at diagnosis. Ileitis was
      induced in card15-deficient mice by GM-CSF neutralization and nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure. Hepatic GH receptor (GHR) abundance and
      GH-dependent Stat5 activation were determined by western blot and Igf-I mRNA
      expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Mean (95%
      confidence interval [CI]) HTz at diagnosis was reduced to -0.48 (-4.2, 2.3) in
      C15(+) GMAb(+) patients, compared to -0.07 (-4.9, 3.4) in disease controls (P </=
      0.05). Circulating GHBP, as a marker for tissue GHR abundance, was reduced in
      C15(+) GMAb(+) patients. Hepatic GHR abundance, GH induction of Stat5 tyrosine
      phosphorylation, and Igf-I mRNA expression were reduced in male card15-deficient 
      mice with ileitis due to GM-CSF neutralization and NSAID exposure. CONCLUSIONS:
      Innate dysfunction due to concurrent genetic variation in CARD15 and neutralizing
      GM-CSF Ab is associated with linear growth failure in pediatric CD, and hepatic
      GH resistance in murine ileitis.

      retrospective study in a Canadian pediatric IBD center.
PG  - 2521-6
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21653 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is used as an alternative immunosuppressive
      treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the
      study was to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of MTX for children with IBD.
      METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in our pediatric IBD center of all
      children having received MTX for the treatment of their IBD between 2000 and
      2008. Remission was defined as discontinuation of steroids and Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index <4 for Crohn's disease (CD) patients or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index (PUCAI) <10 for ulcerative (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC)
      patients. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients had CD, 5 UC, and 13 IC. Mean age at
      diagnosis was 11 (0.6-17.4) years. Ninety patients were previously treated with
      purine analogs and 26 with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Among patients
      assessed for effectiveness of MTX (n = 79), clinical remission was observed in
      29, 37, 25, and 16% of CD patients (n = 63) and 19, 25, 13, and 7% of patients
      with UC or IC (n = 16), respectively, 3, 6,12, and 24 months after initiation of 
      MTX. The 1-year remission rate for CD patients was significantly higher in
      patients with colonic disease. Forty-six patients (49%) experienced side effects 
      but only 13 (14%) had to discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term
      remission rate with MTX in our pediatric IBD population was low. However, MTX was
      generally well tolerated and induced and maintained remission in some patients
      who previously had failed a purine analog and/or anti-TNF. Prospective controlled
      trials are indicated to determine the place of MTX in the management of pediatric
      IBD.

TI  - STAT6 activation in ulcerative colitis: a new target for prevention of
      IL-13-induced colon epithelial cell dysfunction.
PG  - 2224-34
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21628 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is upregulated in ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
      increases colon epithelial permeability by inducing apoptosis and expression of
      the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2. IL-13 induces activation of
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). However, the STAT6
      phosphorylation status in patients with UC is unknown, as is the effect of STAT6 
      inhibition on colonic epithelium exposed to IL-13. The study aims were to
      determine if mucosal STAT6 phosphorylation is increased in patients with UC, and 
      if STAT6 inhibition attenuates IL-13-induced colon epithelial cell dysfunction.
      METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated (p) STAT6 was performed 
      on colonic tissue from newly diagnosed pediatric subjects with UC (early UC) or
      Crohn's disease (CD), colectomy tissue from adults with UC (advanced UC), and
      controls. Colon HT-29 and T84 cells were transfected with STAT6 small interfering
      RNA (siRNA), or treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone
      deacetylase inhibitor that inhibits STAT6, prior to IL-13 treatment. RESULTS: The
      median score for epithelial pSTAT6 was 0 in control subjects, 2 in early UC
      (versus control P = 0.019), 4 in advanced UC (P = 0.003), and 0 in CD (P = 0.4). 
      Cell transfection with STAT6 siRNA prevented IL-13-induced apoptosis and
      claudin-2 expression. SAHA inhibited IL-13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation,
      apoptosis, and claudin-2 expression, and mitigated IL-13-induced reductions in
      transepithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: UC is associated with increased colonic 
      epithelial STAT6 phosphorylation, and STAT6 inhibition prevents IL-13-induced
      apoptosis and barrier disruption. These data identify STAT6 as a novel target for
      UC treatment and support further study of SAHA as a therapeutic agent.

AB  - Thromboembolic events are one of the important extraintestinal manifestations of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases that are associated with considerable morbidity and
      mortality. Iliac vein thrombosis is rarely reported in inflammatory bowel
      diseases. A 9.5 year-old girl was presented with joint pain, nausea, vomiting and
      weight loss. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and right internal iliac vein
      thrombosis. With the implementation of immunosuppressive and anticoagulant
      therapies clinical picture has improved and thrombosis has resolved. Timely
      diagnosis and early treatment of extraintestinal complications of inflammatory
      bowel diseases might be lifesaving.

PG  - 48-53
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.08.007 [doi]
AB  - Thiopurines represent an effective and widely used immunosuppressant in the
      therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease. However up to 25% of
      patients may be unable to continue the drug due to side effects. The incidence of
      hepatotoxicity associated with thiopurine use is reported between 0% and 32%.
      Veno-occlusive disease, peliosis hepatis, perisinusoidal fibrosis and nodular
      regenerative hyperplasia have all been described with thiopurines. Recent trials 
      of 6-tioguanine, although successful in patients with allergies to azathioprine
      or mercaptopurine, have been compromised by increased hepatotoxicity, either
      veno-occlusive disease or nodular regenerative hyperplasia. We describe a report 
      of nodular regenerative hyperplasia in a Crohn's disease patient associated with 
      6-mercaptopurine therapy and have reviewed the management and the literature
      regarding this complication. Our report strengthens the importance of further
      safety studies to evaluate the etiology, prevalence, risk factors and screening
      modalities for hepatotoxicity, in particular of nodular regenerative hyperplasia,
      in patients treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of children with Crohn's disease in 
      Sweden: a questionnaire survey.
PG  - 1018-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02178.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: The general use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as therapy for children
      with Crohn's disease (CD) in Sweden has not previously been studied. Thus, the
      aim of this study was to investigate how EEN is used as therapy in Sweden for
      children with CD. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all 37 paediatric units in
      Sweden that treat children with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The response
      rate was 78%, which covers nearly 90% of Sweden's paediatric population between 0
      and 17 years of age. Ninety-six per cent of the units used EEN as a treatment
      option for children with CD, and 65% of the units used EEN as their primary
      therapy in newly diagnosed CD. The standard duration of EEN was 6 weeks, but the 
      questionnaire revealed a span of 4-8 weeks. The use of polymeric formula was just
      as common as a combination of polymeric and elemental formulas. Fifty-seven per
      cent used oral nutrition supplements, and 81% allowed some extent of concomitant 
      feeding, the addition of food and fluids, during EEN. All units used enteral
      nutrition to some extent as maintenance therapy after EEN was discontinued.
      CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, EEN is used as therapy for children with Crohn's disease 
      (CD), but the EEN protocols vary as to choice of formula and type of food and
      fluids allowed during EEN. Standardized EEN protocols would enable multicentre
      studies in Sweden, with the objective of investigating how EEN treatment can be
      improved and employed in the most efficient way.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The commensal intestinal microbiota drive the inflammation
      associated with Crohn's disease. However, bacteria such as bifidobacteria and
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii appear to be immunoregulatory. In healthy subjects
      the intestinal microbiota are influenced by prebiotic carbohydrates such as
      fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). Preliminary data suggest that FOS increase faecal 
      bifidobacteria, induce immunoregulatory dendritic cell (DC) responses and reduce 
      disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. AIMS AND METHODS: To assess
      the impact of FOS in patients with active Crohn's disease using an adequately
      powered randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with predefined
      clinical, microbiological and immunological end points. Patients with active
      Crohn's disease were randomised to 15 g/day FOS or non-prebiotic placebo for 4
      weeks. The primary end point was clinical response at week 4 (fall in Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index of >/= 70 points) in the intention-to-treat (ITT)
      population. RESULTS: 103 patients were randomised to receive FOS (n = 54) or
      placebo (n = 49). More patients receiving FOS (14 (26%) vs 4 (8%); p = 0.018)
      withdrew before the 4-week end point. There was no significant difference in the 
      number of patients achieving a clinical response between the FOS and placebo
      groups in the ITT analysis (12 (22%) vs 19 (39%), p = 0.067). Patients receiving 
      FOS had reduced proportions of interleukin (IL)-6-positive lamina propria DC and 
      increased DC staining of IL-10 (p < 0.05) but no change in IL-12p40 production.
      There were no significant differences in the faecal concentration of
      bifidobacteria and F prausnitzii between the groups at baseline or after the
      4-week intervention. CONCLUSION: An adequately powered placebo-controlled trial
      of FOS showed no clinical benefit in patients with active Crohn's disease,
      despite impacting on DC function. ISRCTN50422530.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of maintenance infliximab therapy for moderate-to-severe
      Crohn's disease in children: REACH open-label extension.
PG  - 651-62
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2010.547575 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assess long-term effects of maintenance infliximab therapy in children
      with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      One hundred twelve patients with a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      (PCDAI) score >30 received infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 in the REACH
      study. Patients considered responders at week 10 were randomized to infliximab 5 
      mg/kg every 8 (q8w) or 12 (q12w) weeks. Patients who completed treatment through 
      week 46, and who the investigator believed would benefit from continued
      treatment, could enter the open-label extension (OLE) and receive up to three
      additional years of infliximab. No hypothesis testing was performed. CLINICAL
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT0020767. RESULTS:
      Sixty children entered the OLE: 33, 12, and 15 patients were receiving infliximab
      5 mg/kg q8w, 5 mg/kg q12w, and 10 mg/kg q8w, respectively, at extension entry.
      Patients receiving infliximab for up to 3 years during the OLE maintained
      clinical benefit, with approximately 80% of patients consistently having no to
      mild disease activity per the physician's global assessment and very good to fair
      health in the past 2 weeks per the patient and parent/guardian global
      assessments. Patients with >/=1-year delay in bone age at baseline trended toward
      improvement in height during the OLE. Respiratory system disorders, most commonly
      upper respiratory infections, were the most prevalent adverse events reported;
      six (10%) patients had serious infections. CONCLUSIONS: Among children with
      moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease who received infliximab for 46
      weeks in REACH and then for up to 3 additional years in the REACH OLE, infliximab
      was effective in maintaining clinical benefit and was generally well-tolerated.

      disease.
PG  - 13-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.07.021 [doi]
AB  - Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is defined as a "state of nutrition in which a 
      deficiency or excess (or imbalance) of energy, protein, and other nutrients
      causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and
      composition) and function, and clinical outcome". Although this definition
      resulted from a long discussion among experts, it lacks concise assessment
      criteria. Essential to an effective practice of nutrition support, however, is
      the ability to identify who actually needs medical nutrition therapy. Patients
      with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are a high risk group for
      protein-energy malnutrition, with a prevalence ranging up to 75%.

AB  - Bariatric surgery for the treatment of severe obesity has increased dramatically 
      in recent years in the USA and parts of Western Europe. The most commonly used
      technique is the Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). Several nutritional and
      gastrointestinal complications after bariatric surgery have been described during
      the last 10 years. The authors present two patients with diarrhoea and
      malnutrition; one after RYGBP and the other after jejunoileal bypass surgery.
      These patients were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Significance of esophageal Crohn disease in children.
PG  - 291-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181ec21b5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Esophageal Crohn disease (ECD) is more common than it was
      originally thought to be. Only limited information, however, is available
      regarding its significance and effect on clinical course in the pediatric
      population. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of ECD in our
      patient population and compare clinical features and severity of disease among
      patients with ECD and nonesophageal Crohn disease (NECD). PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Medical records of all patients with ECD diagnosed during a 12-year period based 
      on specific endoscopic and histological criteria were reviewed and compared with 
      a random group of patients with NECD. RESULTS: During the study period, 81 (20%) 
      patients with ECD were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 12 (range 4-19
      years) with a male predominance of 63%. Only 29 (36%) patients had symptoms
      suggestive of upper gastrointestinal involvement. Endoscopic ulcers were present 
      in 45 (56%) of patients with ECD, whereas noncaseating granulomas were found in
      10 (12%) of those patients. The majority (89%) of these patients had concomitant 
      gastric and/or duodenal involvement. When compared with 160 random patients with 
      NECD, patients with ECD had higher mean Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index
      scores (40.2 vs 23.9; P < 0.001), more penetrating-type disease (12% vs 2%; P =
      0.001), and a greater frequency of perianal involvement (51% vs 33%; P = 0.005)
      at diagnosis. No differences, however, were noted between the 2 groups in terms
      of need for surgical resection throughout duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with ECD may represent a phenotype of Crohn disease with a more severe
      presentation. Patients with perianal disease at the time of initial physical
      examination should be considered for an upper endoscopy in addition to the
      colonoscopy to exclude esophageal involvement despite the absence of specific
      upper gastrointestinal symptoms. These observations should foster additional
      investigation into ECD phenotype to determine appropriate treatment and
      prognosis.

TI  - Surgical treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 385-90
LID - 10.1007/s00383-010-2809-9 [doi]
AB  - Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often
      necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these
      operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed
      patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional 
      outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence
      (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed 
      in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 
      had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of
      85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1
      stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent
      enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to
      significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The
      transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of 
      unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years
      required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one 
      death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and
      ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective
      ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in
      five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13)
      stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean
      Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All
      attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than
      18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had
      ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves
      frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a
      reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons
      should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and
      families.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect 
      bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may
      contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and
      inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. 
      It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased
      mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone
      resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD 
      and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge
      the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly
      complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss.
      Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation)
      are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical
      for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted
      therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of 
      inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and
      phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential
      limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.

TI  - Physician attitudes and practices of enteral nutrition as primary treatment of
      paediatric Crohn disease in North America.
PG  - 38-42
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181e2c724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in children with Crohn
      disease has not been universally adopted by North American paediatric
      gastroenterologists. This is in stark contrast to their European counterparts.
      The present study aimed to define attitudes and practice patterns of EEN use by
      members of the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition. METHODS: Members were contacted by e-mail and provided
      with access to a Web-based survey. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 326 of 1162
      (30.7%) eligible North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition members from North America (86% United States, 14%
      Canada). Thirty-one percent of respondents reported never using EEN, 55% reported
      sparse use, and 12% reported regular use. Physicians in Canada reported
      significantly more use than those in United States (P < 0.001). Currently working
      and previously working in a centre where EEN was used were highly correlated with
      both the perceived appropriateness of EEN and the regularity of its use (P <
      0.01). More American physicians than Canadian physicians reported that concurrent
      medical therapy was necessary to induce remission (P < 0.001). Canadian
      respondents were more likely to use maintenance therapy than American respondents
      (P = 0.02). Compliance issues were seen as the main disadvantages of EEN and as
      the major barrier to increased use by nonregular users. CONCLUSIONS: There are
      significant variations in the patterns of use and the acceptance of EEN between
      Canada and the United States, with Canadian physicians showing a greater use of
      EEN. The use of EEN appears influenced by the extent to which physicians are
      exposed to its use both in their training and in their current practice setting.

TI  - Surgery in children with Crohn disease refractory to medical therapy.
PG  - 286-90
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181e999af [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of surgery in
      children with Crohn disease (CD) not responding to medical therapy and establish 
      whether surgery improves growth and nutrition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children
      with CD diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed. Relapse was defined by
      Harvey-Bradshaw index >5. Data, reported as median (range), were compared by
      Fisher exact test and repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: One hundred forty-one
      children, ages 12.7 years (3.5-16.8), were identified; 27 (19%) required surgery 
      14.5 months (1.1-61.8) after diagnosis. Twenty-one had elective surgery (19
      isolated ileocaecal disease and stricture, 2 diffuse disease of ileum); 6 had
      emergency surgery (3 peritonitis, 2 haemorrhage, 1 perforation). Surgery included
      18 ileocaecal resection and end-to-end anastomosis, 5 stoma formation, 2 left
      hemicolectomy and end-to-end anastomosis, and 2 stricturoplasty. Follow-up was
      2.5 years (1-9.4). Growth and nutrition improved by 6 and 12 months after
      surgery, with a significant increase in weight z score (P < 0.0001), height z
      score (P < 0.0001), albumin (30 [13-36] vs 39 [30-46] vs 40 [33-45], P < 0.0001),
      and haemoglobin [10 (6.8-13.2) vs 11.7 (8.2-13.7) vs 12.0 (9.3-14.7), P <
      0.0001]. All patients of the received azathioprine (2-2.5 mg . kg(-)(1) .
      day(-)(1)) after surgery. Fifteen patients (55%) relapsed with a modified
      Harvey-Bradshaw index of 8 (6-11) within 11.5 months (4.2-33.4). Of these, 5
      patients (18%) relapsed within 1 year. Five patients (18%) had further surgery (2
      anastomotic strictures, 2 diseased stoma, and 1 enterocutaneous fistula).
      CONCLUSIONS: Growth and nutrition following surgery for CD improve, but there is 
      a high relapse rate. Despite this, the improved growth and nutrition before
      relapse may be beneficial during puberty and justify surgery in children not
      responding to medications.

AB  - We report a patient with Crohn's disease who presented with renal insufficiency
      and the nephrotic syndrome after initiating therapy with adalimumab. Renal biopsy
      showed stages 2 to 3 membranous glomerulonephritis, and immunostaining showed
      glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin G and C3. The patient's serum creatinine 
      decreased after discontinuation of adalimumab, and treatment with prednisone and 
      mycophenolic acid reversed his proteinuria. The pathogenesis of glomerular
      disease induced by antitumor necrosis factor antibodies is uncertain, and the
      potential roles of the generation of autoantibodies, development of
      antiadalimumab antibodies, and the interaction of adalimumab with glomerular
      tumor necrosis factor are discussed.

PG  - 234-9
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181f39af5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) induces clinical remission in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). GOALS: This study explored changes in fecal
      calprotectin concentration during treatment with EEN. STUDY: Fecal calprotectin
      was measured in 4 serial stool samples from CD children during EEN. The Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and systemic markers of disease activity
      were measured at the beginning and end of treatment. RESULTS: Fifteen CD children
      (7 girls; 11.6+/-2.3 y) participated. PCDAI decreased in 14 children and 7
      children achieved clinical remission (PCDAI </=10). Fecal calprotectin
      concentration decreased (30 d, P=0.014; 60 d, P<0.0001) only in those children
      who entered clinical remission (PCDAI </=10). In the whole group mean
      calprotectin concentration at baseline (2158+/-642 mg/kg) was reduced by 975
      mg/kg (95% confidence interval -1783; -167) after 30 days and 1700 mg/kg (95%
      confidence interval -2508; -892) on EEN completion. Only one child reached normal
      levels by the end of EEN. Decrease of pretreatment calprotectin levels by more
      than 18% after 30 days on EEN predicted clinical response at the end of EEN.
      Calprotectin levels at the end of EEN treatment did not predict the length of
      time lapsed to a future relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study calprotectin
      decreased in patients who achieved clinical remission and may be useful to
      predict response to treatment.

PG  - 516-23
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) may have proinflammatory roles in addition to
      its contribution to the maintenance of bone mass. Exclusive enteral nutrition
      (EEN) is an established therapy for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease
      (CD). The aims of this study were to ascertain serum, fecal, and mucosal
      expression of OPG in children with CD and to investigate the effects of EEN on
      OPG expression. METHODS: OPG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in
      serum, mucosal, and fecal samples collected from children with CD and controls.
      Fecal and Serum OPG was measured prior to and following 6-8 weeks of EEN therapy.
      RESULTS: Children with CD (n=82) and controls (n=45) were included. Mucosal and
      fecal OPG levels were elevated in CD compared to controls (P=0.018 and P<0.0001, 
      respectively). Serum OPG was elevated in children with severe CD (P=0.005). Serum
      and fecal OPG levels dropped significantly following EEN therapy (P=0.0001 and
      P=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum and fecal OPG are seen in
      active CD and likely originate from the inflamed gut. Fecal and serum OPG
      decrease following EEN therapy. Further investigation of OPG and related proteins
      in the setting of IBD is now required.

TI  - Crohn's disease activity index does not correlate with endoscopic recurrence one 
      year after ileocolonic resection.
PG  - 118-26
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease clinical trials utilize the Crohn's Disease Activity 
      Index (CDAI) to measure primary endpoint assessments of clinical recurrence and
      remission. We evaluated the extent of agreement between clinical
      recurrence/remission as defined by the CDAI and endoscopic recurrence 1 year
      after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Twenty-four CD
      patients who had been randomly assigned to a postoperative clinical trial had 1
      year clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessment for disease recurrence.
      The primary endpoint was the extent of agreement between endoscopic recurrence
      and clinical recurrence 1 year after intestinal resection for CD. Secondary
      endpoints were extent of agreement between endoscopic recurrence and the
      surrogate markers of CD activity, i.e., histological activity, sedimentation
      rate, and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Twelve of the 24 patients (50%) were
      in endoscopic remission (i0, i1) and 12 (50%) had endoscopic recurrence (i2, i3, 
      or i4). There was good agreement between endoscopy and histological activity
      scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.53, kappa coefficient = 0.58). In 
      contrast, there was little to no relationship between endoscopy and CDAI scores; 
      median CDAI scores for endoscopy scores of i0/i1, i2, i3, and i4 were 118, 76,
      156, and 78, respectively (P for trend = 0.88). The kappa coefficient (of
      agreement) between endoscopy score +/- 2 and CDAI score +/- 150 was 0.12 (exact P
      = 0.68), indicating poor agreement. Similarly, there was no consistent
      association observed between endoscopy scores and mean CRP and ESR values at week
      54. CONCLUSIONS: The CDAI shows poor agreement with endoscopic recurrence 1 year 
      after intestinal resection. Endoscopic recurrence should be the primary endpoint 
      of future postoperative studies and ileocolonoscopy the gold standard test to
      detect postoperative recurrence.

AB  - Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need
      to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American
      Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national
      guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may
      differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of
      Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics 
      in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions 
      of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of
      activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid
      dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease,
      in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer;
      risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special
      situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical
      literature and clinical experience of a national working group.

TI  - Bones in pediatric Crohn's disease: a review of fracture risk in children and
      adults.
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21471 [doi]
AB  - There is evidence to suggest that the inflammation associated with Crohn's
      disease (CD) impacts the bone health of patients, predisposing them to early
      onset osteoporosis and increasing their risk of fracture. Fractures have been
      documented in patients with CD, with a high proportion of these being found
      during young adulthood, which suggests that these patients are not simply
      fracturing as a result of the normal aging process but rather due to the presence
      of CD. In population terms, patients with CD have increased risk of fracture
      compared with the general population. Studies in children suggest that,
      irrespective of time on corticosteroid therapy, the underlying systemic
      inflammation associated with CD is an independent detrimental influence on the
      bone health of children with CD. This poses the question as to whether the onset 
      of disease in childhood predisposes the individual to increased risk of future
      fractures later in life, as a result of decreased peak bone mass during the
      growing years. It is generally believed that dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry-assessed areal bone mineral density is a good indicator of
      fracture risk; however, several studies have shown this may not be the case. New 
      research, utilizing peripheral quantitative computed tomography, which provides a
      true volumetric assessment of bone, suggests altered bone geometry in patients
      with CD, which poses a structural threat by being more brittle and susceptible to
      damage accumulation.

TI  - Immunogenecity of hepatitis A vaccine in pediatric patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1117-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are only a few studies on immune response to routine
      vaccinations in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), despite a strong 
      need for this kind of study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) in IBD pediatric
      patients compared with healthy controls. METHODS: This was an open, prospective, 
      and controlled study on anti-HAV-negative children and adolescents age 2-18 years
      with IBD. HAV using 720 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units were
      administered at 0 months and at 6-12 months. Seroconversion and geometric mean
      titers were measured after each vaccine dose. The evidence of local and systemic 
      adverse effects for 3 days after the first and second dose of vaccine was
      registered. RESULTS: A total of 134 subjects (66 patients and 68 controls)
      completed the whole study course consisting of two doses of vaccine and six serum
      samples. There was no significant difference in the rate of seroconversion
      between IBD patients and controls when measured after the second dose of vaccine 
      (97% versus 100%, P = 0.2407), but the rate was significantly lower in the IBD
      group when measured after the first dose (39% versus 64%, P = 0.00001). The mean 
      geometric titers were statistically significantly lower in the IBD group than in 
      the control group at all of the measured timepoints. There were no serious
      adverse events related to HAV during the study. CONCLUSIONS: HAV is both
      immunogenic and safe in pediatric patients with IBD.

PG  - 112-5
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

TI  - The prevalence of malnutrition and the evolution of nutritional status in
      patients with moderate to severe forms of Crohn's disease treated with
      Infliximab.
PG  - 86-91
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is variably encountered in adult patients with
      Crohn's disease. We evaluated the nutritional status at the beginning and during 
      Infliximab treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Patients with
      moderate/severe flares of disease treated with Infliximab for induction and
      maintenance of remission were included in a prospective observational study. Body
      Mass Index and Nutritional Risk Index were calculated in each patient at 0, 6
      weeks and than every 8 weeks for one year. RESULTS: From 30 patients treated with
      Infliximab 59.3% had low BMI, 35.7% being undernourished. The severity of Crohn's
      disease did not correlate with low BMI but did correlate with Nutritional Risk
      Index (p = 0.001). In all patients that responded to Infliximab treatment
      progressive weight gain was observed, all but one patient reaching normal BMI
      after one year. Mean weight gain was significantly more elevated (p = 0.001) and 
      time needed to reach normal BMI was longer in the undernutrition group (p =
      0.01). Clinical remission was the principal factor associated with weight gain (p
      = 0.001), while there was no influence of endoscopic remission on nutritional
      status. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate/severe forms of Crohn's disease
      malnutrition is frequently encountered. Induction and maintenance treatment with 
      Infliximab determines weight gain and corrects malnutrition in all patients with

TI  - Is Crohn's creeping fat an adipose tissue?
PG  - 747-57
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21413 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In human pathology, the "creeping fat" (CF) of the mesentery is
      unique to Crohn's disease (CD). CF is usually referred to as an ectopic extension
      of mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT). However, since no animal model developing CF 
      has ever been established, very little is known about this type of fat-depot
      expansion and its role in the development of the disease. METHODS: We developed
      and standardized an experimental protocol in mice that reproducibly induces CF
      development when a severe colonic inflammation is obtained by intracolonic
      instillation of DNBS. RESULTS: Macro-microscopic observations revealed a fatty
      appearance of CF. Yet when compared to MAT from the same animals, CF contains
      very little triglycerides, few adipocytes, and we observed a very low expression 
      and protein levels of both adipose markers (hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin) 
      and adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin). The decreased expression of perilipin
      in CF was also observed by immunohistochemistry. Conversely, the expression of
      proinflammatory and fibrous markers (Pref-1) was much higher in CF than in MAT.
      These observations were fully consistent with those made on CF recovered from
      five CD patients and compared with subcutaneous and mesenteric fat from the same 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this work reports an original experimental
      mice model of CF. In this model we establish for the first time that CF only
      occurs in severe colonic inflammation and shows an inflammatory, fibrous but not 
      an adipose pattern.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease aggregation in Utah kindreds.
PG  - 823-30
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The observed heritability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      incompletely explained by known genetic risk factors. Kindred-specific genetic
      variants that cause IBD may be a source of "missing heritability." Given that
      they have been previously difficult to identify, we sought to identify high-risk 
      IBD kindreds. METHODS: We used a large population-based database--the Utah
      Population Database (UPDB)--which contains genealogical and healthcare data to
      characterize the risk of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD
      in kindreds. We identified CD and UC cases using ICD-9 codes. We calculated the
      adjusted relative risk to relatives of affected individuals. We calculated the
      familial standardized incidence ratio (FSIR) to quantify the kindred-specific
      disease risk. RESULTS: In all, 3601 CD cases and 3976 UC cases met inclusion
      criteria. A total of 655 CD kindreds and 615 UC kindreds had a statistical excess
      of disease. Risk of disease varied among kindreds, with some kindreds
      demonstrating approximately 20-fold elevated risk. For CD, UC, and IBD, relative 
      risks were significantly elevated for first- and second-degree relatives and
      first cousins. The adjusted population attributable risks for familial CD, UC,
      and IBD were 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.23); 0.17 (0.14-0.21);
      and 0.19 (0.17-0.22), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple kindreds 
      with a statistical excess of CD, UC, and IBD, and validated the UPDB as a
      resource for family studies in IBD. Given the need for novel genetic mapping
      strategies to explain the apparent missing heritability in IBD, further studies
      of these high-risk kindreds is justified.

TI  - Intestinal ferroportin expression in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 524-31
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21367 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a frequent complication of Crohn's disease (CD). The
      intestinal iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) is involved in both iron deficiency
      anemia and the anemia of chronic disease. To examine its role in CD, intestinal
      FPN expression was studied in subjects with and without CD. METHODS: Duodenal
      mucosal biopsies from 29 pediatric subjects with CD (n=19) and without CD (n=10) 
      were obtained. FPN protein was measured using Western blot analysis and mRNA was 
      assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS:
      Intestinal FPN protein was higher in anemic CD subjects than in nonanemic CD
      subjects (P=0.01), while FPN mRNA levels were not different (P=0.66). In
      nonanemic CD subjects, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P=0.04), C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) (P=0.03), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P=0.01) levels were elevated
      compared to controls. Nonanemic CD subjects had a lower median FPN protein than
      nonanemic controls, although it did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07). 
      Median FPN mRNA was similar between groups (P=0.71). Although no correlation
      between FPN protein and IL-6 was noted, there was a strong negative correlation
      between serum iron and IL-6, both in subjects with CD (r=-0.88, P<0.0001) and
      those without anemia (r=-0.58, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal FPN protein is
      upregulated in anemic CD subjects, suggesting that iron deficiency or anemia is
      the driving force regulating FPN levels. A transporter distinct from FPN appears 
      to be involved in the hypoferremia associated with the inflammatory process of
      CD.

      Crohn's disease strictures.
PG  - 121-5
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2010.05.001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate prospectively the clinical efficacy and safety of endoscopic
      hydrostatic balloon dilation in a consecutive cohort of symptomatic intestinal
      Crohn's disease strictures. METHODS: Between September 2003 and December 2008 we 
      performed endoscopic balloon dilations in 37 Crohn's disease patients with 39
      intestinal symptomatic strictures (4 naive and 35 postoperative). Dilations were 
      performed using a Rigiflex through-the-scope balloon. Clinical success rate was
      claimed if a patient remained asymptomatic and did not require surgery or further
      endoscopic dilation, following technical success. Actuarial curves of clinical,
      endoscopic (redilation) and surgical recurrence were obtained by Kaplan-Meier
      method. Demographic and disease variables were related to the main outcomes.
      RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 26.3 months (range, 2-61 months), the
      long-term global benefit rate was 89% (33/37). The 1-2-3 years cumulative
      symptom-free rates were respectively: 76%, 55% and 46%. Four patients were
      operated upon. Technical success predicts a lower rate of surgery. There were no 
      complications related to the endoscopic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic
      balloon dilation of symptomatic Crohn's disease strictures may achieve clinical
      benefit in many patients and is a valid alternative to surgery in the management 
      of the disease. Dilation may be repeated in recurrent intestinal obstructions and
      appears safe without morbidity.

      in Crohn's disease patients compared to healthy population.
PG  - 197-202
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1235-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease might have accelerated atherosclerosis 
      due to: chronic systemic inflammation, metabolic changes or prolonged steroid
      treatment. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of sub-clinical
      atherosclerosis in Crohn's disease, by measuring the intima-media thickness and
      peak systolic velocity of the common carotid artery. METHODS: Fifty Crohn's
      disease patients aged between 20 and 45 years were compared to 25 controls.
      Patients with a family history of cardiovascular diseases or a known risk for
      atherosclerosis were excluded. All participants underwent nutritional assessment.
      Carotid artery ultrasonography was performed and intima-media thickness and peak 
      systolic velocity were measured, proximal to the common carotid bifurcation.
      Clinical data and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein, and plasma homocysteine) were determined. RESULTS: No significant
      differences between the groups were found for intima-media thickness or peak
      systolic velocity. Multiple regression analysis revealed a positive correlation
      of intima-media thickness with older age. Peak systolic velocity was negatively
      associated with age. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients do not have an
      increased risk for developing early atherosclerosis.
