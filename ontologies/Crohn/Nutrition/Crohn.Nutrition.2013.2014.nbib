TI  - [Dietary intake in Crohn's disease: results of a prospective comparative study].
PG  - 551-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is thought to have an important role in the etiopathogenesis of 
      Crohn's disease. In the other hand, Crohn's disease is frequently associated with
      nutritional deficiencies probably as result of disease activity and poor oral
      intake. AIMS: To investigate the dietary intake in patients with Crohn's disease 
      in comparison with matched population controls and to assess the correlation
      between the results of the dietary enquete, nutritional status and disease
      activity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case control study in patients with
      Crohn's disease and matched controls. All subjects were evaluated in respect of
      dietary intake (based on "NUTISTAR" logiciel) and nutritional status. RESULTS: We
      studied 23 patients and 23 controls. There was no statistical difference between 
      patients and controls according to the proportion of carbohydrates, fat and
      protein intakes. Energy intakes were significantly lower in patients with Crohn's
      disease (1991 + 678 kcal/j) compared to controls (2537 + 345 kcal/j) (p=0.007) ; 
      and in active disease (1353 + 308 kcal/j) compared to inactive disease patients
      (2481 + 415 kcal/j) (p<0.0001). In Crohn's disease patients, correlation study
      showed that energy intakes were correlated with CDAI (p<0.0001 ; r = - 0.74) and 
      BMI (p=0.03 ; r = 0.45). CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, an inadequate dietary
      intake is correlated with nutritional status and disease activity.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients may be at a higher risk for developing 
      infections due to underlying disease, malnutrition, surgery, or immunosuppressive
      therapy. Therefore, protecting this group against infections is of particular
      importance. Immunisation against vaccine-preventable diseases is strongly
      recommended. This article for the first time summarises data on immunogenicity
      and safety of vaccines in IBD children and provides an update on some important
      issues regarding immunisation in these group of children.

AB  - PURPOSE: Children with perianal Crohn's disease (PCD) are a unique and diverse
      patient population. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of
      disease and role of surgery. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all
      children having at least one surgical intervention for PCD over 10 years was
      performed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (63% male) aged 0.5-17 (median 13) years
      were identified. Perianal disease consisted of skin tags (49%), superficial
      fistulae (49%), deep fistulae (37%), superficial abscesses (68%), deep abscesses 
      (9%), skin breakdown (19%), and anal strictures (7%). 84% received anti-TNF
      therapy, with 27% treated with a second anti-TNF medication. Minor surgical
      procedures, commonly done during anti-TNF therapy, included abscess drainage
      (67%) and seton placement (33%). Major surgical procedures, done almost
      exclusively after anti-TNF failure, included defunctioning ileostomy (23%) and
      subtotal colectomy (9%). Follow-up ranged from 7 to 160 (median 54) months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric PCD has a wide range of disease severity. Minor surgery
      provides adequate drainage before and during anti-TNF therapy, while major
      surgery plays a role in medically refractory disease. Appropriate surgical
      intervention remains an important part of the treatment paradigm.

TI  - Focal enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates in the gastric mucosa:
      potential role in the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 276-82

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates
      are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may
      reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are
      also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these 
      gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a
      population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven
      Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included.
      The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The
      presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was
      recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's
      disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls,
      presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 
      88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were 
      only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori
      infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61%
      and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with
      Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only
      in H. pylori-negative specimens.

TI  - Efficacy of concomitant elemental diet therapy in scheduled infliximab therapy in
      patients with Crohn's disease to prevent loss of response.
PG  - 1382-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3493-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important
      clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED)
      therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy
      can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate
      the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in
      patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal
      CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients
      were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and
      the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the
      basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the
      physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy
      of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With
      the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient
      characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was
      significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled
      IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for
      small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and
      ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the
      non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in
      maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in
      order to prevent LOR.

      natural and parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 410-7

AB  - UNLABELLED: One of the elements of treatment considering inflammatory bowel
      diseases is nutritional therapy. The duration of the above-mentioned depends on
      the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the
      functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence.
      Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside
      pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods.
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead
      towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the
      reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the
      quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral
      nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the
      Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of
      Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was
      performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization
      Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to
      deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life
      was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor
      education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The 
      quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and
      additional medical care.

TI  - Insights into the molecular basis of the NOD2 signalling pathway.
LID - 10.1098/rsob.140178 [doi]
LID - 140178 [pii]
AB  - The cytosolic pattern recognition receptor NOD2 is activated by the peptidoglycan
      fragment muramyl dipeptide to generate a proinflammatory immune response.
      Downstream effects include the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin 8, the 
      upregulation of pro-interleukin 1beta, the induction of autophagy, the production
      of antimicrobial peptides and defensins, and contributions to the maintenance of 
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Polymorphisms in NOD2 are the cause
      of the inflammatory disorder Blau syndrome and act as susceptibility factors for 
      the inflammatory bowel condition Crohn's disease. The complexity of NOD2
      signalling is highlighted by the observation that over 30 cellular proteins
      interact with NOD2 directly and influence or regulate its functional activity.
      Previously, the majority of reviews on NOD2 function have focused upon the role
      of NOD2 in inflammatory disease or in its interaction with and response to
      microbes. However, the functionality of NOD2 is underpinned by its biochemical
      interactions. Consequently, in this review, we have taken the opportunity to
      address the more 'basic' elements of NOD2 signalling. In particular, we have
      focused upon the core interactions of NOD2 with protein factors that influence
      and modulate the signal transduction pathways involved in NOD2 signalling.
      Further, where information exists, such as in relation to the role of RIP2, we
      have drawn comparison with the closely related, but functionally discrete,
      pattern recognition receptor NOD1. Overall, we provide a comprehensive resource
      targeted at understanding the complexities of NOD2 signalling.

      pancreatic antibodies by a novel ELISA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on
      recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the
      major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and
      assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive 
      IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary
      centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA
      anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95,
      99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%.
      IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a
      specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or
      IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA 
      anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease
      onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive
      disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more
      likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms
      the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with 
      disease severity phenotypes.

LID - 10.1556/OH.2014.29973 [doi]
AB  - Home parenteral nutrition administered in selected care centres has been financed
      in Hungary since January, 2013. The authors discuss diagnostic issues, treatment 
      and nutrition therapy of short bowel syndrome patients in line with the
      principles of personalised medicine. The most severe form of short bowel syndrome
      occurs in patients having jejunostomy, whose treatment is discussed separately.
      The authors give a detailed overview of home parenteral feeding, its possible
      complications, outcomes and adaptation of the remaining bowel. They describe how 
      their own care centre operates where they administer home parenteral nutrition to
      12 patients with short bowel syndrome (5 females and 7 males aged 51.25+/-14.4
      years). The body mass index was 19.07+/-5.08 kg/m2 and 20.87+/-3.3 kg/m2,
      skeletal muscle mass was 25.7+/-6.3 kg and 26.45+/-5.38 kg, and body fat mass was
      14.25+/-8.55 kg and 11.77+/-2.71 kg at the start of home parenteral nutrition and
      presently, respectively. The underlying conditions of short bowel syndrome were
      tumours in 4 patients, bowel ischaemia in four patients, surgical complications
      in three patients, Crohn's disease in one patient, and Crohn's disease plus
      tumour in one patient.

LID - 10.1556/OH.2014.29983 [doi]
AB  - The association between nutrition and intestinal function is based on facts. The 
      main function of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain
      life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal diseases commonly result in
      malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic malnutrition impairs 
      digestive and absorptive function. Parenteral and enteral nutritions are
      effective therapeutic modalities in several diseases. In cases of
      gastrointestinal malfunctions, nutrition has a direct therapeutic role. The
      benefit of nutrition therapy is similar to medical treatment in patients with
      pancreatitis, Crohn disease, hepatic failure, and in those with gastrointestinal 
      fistulas. Nutrition has both supportive and therapeutic roles in the management
      of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques
      of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic
      gastrointestinal diseases can be reduced.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

AB  - We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to 
      examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort
      study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative
      colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on
      demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We
      used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers,
      controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among
      centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio
      [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis 
      factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of
      immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor
      therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of
      evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce
      variation and improve outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that in children with Crohn's disease (CD) isolated to
      a single site, resection leads to clinical improvement, decreased medication
      requirements, and improved growth. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted 
      of children with CD isolated to the terminal ileum undergoing operative
      intervention at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2002 and 2013. RESULTS:
      Twenty-six patients underwent ileocecetomy (mean age at diagnosis 14.1 +/- 2.6
      years; mean age at resection 15.7 +/- 2.5 years; median follow-up 2 +/- 1.5
      years). Twenty-two (84.6%) patients reported clinical improvement and 17 (65.4%) 
      were able to decrease the number or dosage of medications. Average weight
      increased from the 29th to the 45th percentile (P = .09) at 1 year and to the
      56th percentile (P = .02) at 3 years post resection. Average body mass index
      increased from the 30th to the 48th and 49th percentile at 1 and 3 years (P < .05
      for both), respectively. Height increased from the 39th percentile at the time of
      resection to the 51st percentile at 3 years (P = nonsignificant). CONCLUSION:
      Surgical resection of an isolated ileal segment in adolescents with CD allows for
      catch-up growth and reduction in medication requirements.

PG  - 5298-311
LID - 10.3390/nu6115298 [doi]
AB  - One of the most effective forms of therapeutic enteral nutrition is designated as
      "exclusive enteral nutrition" (EEN). EEN constitutes the monotonous enteral
      delivery of complete liquid nutrition and has been most explored in the treatment
      Crohn's disease (CD), a form of inflammatory bowel disease. While EEN's
      mechanisms of action are not clearly understood, it has been shown to modify the 
      composition of the intestinal microbiome, an important component of CD
      pathogenesis. The current literature on the intestinal microbiome in healthy
      individuals and CD patients is reviewed with respect to EEN therapy. Further
      investigations in this field are needed to better understand the role and
      potential for EEN in chronic human disorders.

TI  - Infliximab therapy in pediatric patients 7 years of age and younger.
PG  - 758-62
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000533 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is efficacious for induction and maintenance of
      remission in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). It has, however, not been studied in patients 7 years old and
      younger. Our aim was to characterize efficacy and safety of IFX therapy in this
      cohort. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with IBD ages 7 years
      and younger, treated with IFX between 1999 and 2011. Medical records were
      reviewed for age of diagnosis, disease phenotype, therapy, surgery, IFX infusion 
      dates, dose, and intervals. Outcome measures included physician global
      assessment, corticosteroid requirement, and adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-three
      children (ages 2.4-7 years) were included. Twenty patients had Crohn disease, 4
      had ulcerative colitis, and 9 had indeterminate colitis. Maintenance of IFX
      therapy at 1, 2, and 3 years was 36%, 18%, and 12%, respectively. Patients of age
      5 years and younger had the lowest rates of maintenance of therapy at 25% at year
      1, and 10% at years 2 and 3 combined. Nine percent of all of the patients
      demonstrated response measured by the physician global assessment and were
      steroid free at 1 year. There were 8 infusion reactions. There were no
      malignancies, serious infections, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: IFX demonstrated a
      modest response rate and a low steroid-sparing effect in patients with IBD 7
      years old and younger. Although this is a limited study, there appears to be a
      trend for decreased sustained efficacy with IFX in this age group, particularly
      in children 5 years old and younger, when compared with the previously published 
      literature in older children.

TI  - Effects of enteral nutritional support on malnourished patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease by subjective global assessment.
PG  - 493-507
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.4955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by subjective global assessment (SGA) and the
      effects of oral nutritional support on the clinical parameters, consumption of
      energy, macronutrients and fiber intake in the Study and Control groups,
      prospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female)
      hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 
      25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity,
      clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using
      subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were
      blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a
      standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the
      Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the
      independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body
      body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the
      dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status,
      disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients.
      RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was
      92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease
      activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both
      the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the
      Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber
      consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all
      the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in
      patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral
      nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their
      energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for
      nutritional monitoring.

TI  - Efficacy of oral methotrexate in paediatric Crohn's disease: a multicentre
      propensity score study.
PG  - 1898-904
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307964 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral methotrexate (MTX) administration avoids weekly injections,
      reduces costs and may improve quality of life of patients with Crohn's disease
      (CD), especially children. Routes of administration have never been
      systematically compared in CD. We aimed to compare effectiveness and safety of
      orally (PO) versus subcutaneously (SC) administered MTX in paediatric CD.
      METHODS: 226 children with CD treated with oral or subcutaneous MTX were included
      in a multicentre, retrospective 1-year cohort study (62% boys, mean age
      13.8+/-2.8 years, 88% previous thiopurines). 38 (17%) were initially commenced on
      oral, 98 (43%) started subcutaneous and switched to oral and 90 (40%) were
      treated with subcutaneous only. Matching and 'doubly robust' weighted regression 
      models were based on the propensity score method, controlling for
      confounding-by-indication bias. 11/23 pretreatment variables were different
      between the groups, but the propensity score modelling successfully balanced the 
      treatment groups. RESULTS: 76 children (34%) had sustained steroid-free remission
      with a difference that did not reach significance between the PO and the SC
      groups (weighted OR=1.72 (95% CI 0.5 to 5.9); p=0.52). There were no differences 
      in need for treatment escalation (p=0.24), elevated liver enzymes (p=0.59) or
      nausea (p=0.85). Height velocity was lower in the PO group (p=0.006) and time to 
      remission was delayed in the PO group (p=0.036; Fleming (0, 1) test).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this largest paediatric CD cohort to date, SC administered MTX
      was superior to PO, but only in some of the outcomes and with a modest effect
      size. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider switching children in complete 
      remission treated with subcutaneous MTX to the oral route with close monitoring
      of inflammatory markers and growth.

TI  - Multiple micronutrient supplementation transiently ameliorates environmental
      enteropathy in Malawian children aged 12-35 months in a randomized controlled
      clinical trial.
PG  - 2059-65
LID - 10.3945/jn.114.201673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is subclinical, diffuse villous
      atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa
      associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting. EE is assessed by the
      lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test, whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and
      quantified in the urine. Multiple micronutrient (MN) deficiency morphologically
      mimics EE, and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal
      inflammation in Crohn disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that
      supplementary MNs, with or without fish oil (FO), would improve L:M in rural
      Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control (C) group receiving a
      placebo. METHODS: The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26
      vitamins, minerals, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This was a
      3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with the
      primary outcomes being the change in L:M (DeltaL:M) after 12 and 24 wk of
      supplementation. Comparisons were made for DeltaL:M after 12 and 24 wk within
      each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, because the data
      are not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 230 children had specimens
      adequate for analysis; all had an abnormal baseline L:M, defined as >0.10. After 
      12 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M [mean (95% CI)] of -0.10
      (-0.04, -0.15; P = 0.001), and children receiving only MNs had DeltaL:M of -0.12 
      (-0.03, -0.21; P = 0.002). After 24 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a
      DeltaL:M of -0.09 (-0.03, -0.15; P = 0.001); children receiving only MNs had a
      DeltaL:M of -0.11 (-0.02, -0.20; P = 0.001), and the C group had DeltaL:M of
      -0.07 (0.02, -0.16); P = 0.002). Linear growth was similar in all groups,
      approximately 4.3 cm over 24 wk. CONCLUSION: Although the effect was modest,
      these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children.
      The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033.

TI  - Systematic review with meta-analysis: magnetic resonance enterography signs for
      the detection of inflammation and intestinal damage in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 153-66
LID - 10.1111/apt.13024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), mucosal healing has become 
      a major goal, with the hope of avoiding intestinal damage from chronic
      inflammation. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has emerged as a non-invasive
      means of monitoring inflammation and damage. AIMS: As part of the development of 
      MRE-based multi-item measures of inflammation and damage for paediatric studies, 
      we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify MRE variables
      used to describe these two distinct concepts. METHODS: 2501 studies of MRI and CD
      were identified. Studies written in any language reporting individual MRE signs
      for patients diagnosed with CD were included. Two-hundred-and-forty-four studies 
      were fully reviewed and 62 were included (inflammation, n = 51; damage, n = 24). 
      Sensitivity, specificity and associated confidence intervals were calculated, and
      hierarchical summary ROC curves were constructed for each MRE sign. RESULTS: A
      total of 22 MRE signs were used to reflect inflammation, and 9 to reflect damage.
      Diagnostic accuracy of MRE signs of inflammation and damage was heterogeneous;
      however, wall enhancement, mucosal lesions and wall T2 hyperintensity were the
      most consistently useful for inflammation (most sensitivities >80% and
      specificities >90%), and detection of abscess and fistula were most consistently 
      useful for damage (most sensitivities >90%, specificities >95%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Identifying the best MRE variables to reflect inflammation and damage will
      maximise the utility of this rapidly emerging technique and is the first stage of
      constructing MRE-based indices for evaluating inflammation and intestinal damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with
      intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies
      revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our
      understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We
      performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe
      autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and
      non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function.
      RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a
      coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell
      activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily
      highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein 
      folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4
      dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in
      carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical
      presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and 
      intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell
      proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of
      memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that variants in CTLA4
      provide the basis for a novel Mendelian form of early-onset CD associated with
      systemic autoimmunity. Incomplete penetrance of autoimmunity further indicates
      the presence of other genetic and/or environmental modifiers.

AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, 
      is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong 
      genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive
      mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut
      microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation 
      processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN
      pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's
      disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a
      wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of
      diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the
      subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive
      research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular
      assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Analysis of body composition in patients with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 981-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in body composition between Crohn's
      disease(CD) patients and healthy subjects as well as the characteristics of human
      body composition in various types of CD. METHODS: A total of 57 CD patients were 
      prospectively selected from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
      University as the study group, while 51 healthy subjects as the control group.
      Protein content, mineral content, fat content, lean body mass, waist
      circumference, and hip circumference in the two groups were measured by body
      composition analyzer. Characteristics of CD at different location and different
      disease activity index were investigated as well. RESULTS: Intracellular fluid,
      extracellular fluid, weight, protein content, fat content, lean body mass, muscle
      weight, body fat ratio, waist hip ratio, body weight ratio, arm muscle
      circumference, arm circumference, quality of cells, BMI and basal metabolic rate 
      in CD patients were significantly lower than those in control group(all P<0.05). 
      Proportion of protein-deficiency patients and fat-deficiency patients were 66.7% 
      and 47.4% respectively. Protein content, fat content, and lean body mass in
      ileocolic CD patients were lower than those with small bowel and colonic CD(all
      P<0.05). Protein content, fat content, lean body mass in patients with high
      disease activity index were lower than those in patients with low and medium
      index, but higher basal metablic rate was found in the former group(all P<0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The human body composition in patients with CD are different from
      healthy people. Disease location and disease activity index have an impact on
      protein content, fat content, and lean body mass.

TI  - [Nutrition support therapy of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 964-7
AB  - Malnutrition is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD). The
      therapeutic role of nutrition has attracted more and more attention in the
      development of IBD. In recent years, researches have demonstrated that nutrition 
      support has its unique advantages in improving patients nutritional status and
      reducing adverse events, and it has been recommended as the first line therapy in
      children with active Crohn disease. Since there are no standardized guidelines of
      nutritional support therapy worldwide, this article is to review the relationship
      between nutrition and IBD, the choice of nutritional therapy mode, the duration
      of the nutritional treatment and evaluation of therapeutic effects based on
      Expert Consensus on Nutrition Support Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      (2013.Shenzhen).

LID - 10.1586/1744666X.2014.955017 [doi]
AB  - The treatment of Crohn's disease in children has undergone a revolution in the
      past decade following studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of
      anti-TNFalpha agents in producing durable clinical response/remission as well as 
      reversal of growth delay in many patients. The positioning of biologic therapy
      continues to be debated. Should it be reserved for children failing conventional 
      therapy including immunomodulators or should it be used as primary therapy
      shortly after diagnosis in children with more severe disease likely to suffer a
      more complicated disease course? Risk stratification will be crucial to any
      therapeutic decisions and emerging data hold promise that identification of those
      most likely to benefit will be available in the near future.

TI  - A preoperative low nutritional prognostic index correlates with the incidence of 
      incisional surgical site infections after bowel resection in patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1366-72
LID - 10.1007/s00595-014-1044-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of incisional surgical site infections (SSIs) is reported 
      to be higher among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than among those with
      colorectal cancer. It has also been reported that the preoperative nutritional
      and inflammatory status is associated with the frequency of postoperative
      complications. Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) is a simple and
      useful parameter for determining the nutritional and inflammatory status. In the 
      present study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between the OPNI
      and the incidence of incisional SSI in patients with CD who had undergone bowel
      resection. METHODS: A total of 177 CD patients who underwent abdominal surgery
      were enrolled. Various clinical factors and the OPNI values were evaluated to
      identify risk factors for incisional SSIs. RESULTS: The incidence of incisional
      SSIs was 19.8 %. A multivariate analysis indicated that the OPNI was an
      independent risk factor for incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
      retrospective study suggest that the OPNI is an independent risk factor for
      incisional SSIs in patients with a history of bowel resection for CD.

TI  - Crohn's disease and growth deficiency in children and adolescents.
PG  - 13219-33
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i37.13219 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional concerns, linear growth deficiency, and delayed puberty are currently
      detected in up to 85% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosed at
      childhood. To provide advice on how to assess and manage nutritional concerns in 
      these patients, a Medline search was conducted using "pediatric inflammatory
      bowel disease", "pediatric Crohn's disease", "linear growth", "pubertal growth", 
      "bone health", and "vitamin D" as key words. Clinical trials, systematic reviews,
      and meta-analyses published between 2008 and 2013 were selected to produce this
      narrative review. Studies referring to earlier periods were also considered if
      the data was relevant to our review. Although current treatment strategies for CD
      that include anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy have been shown to improve 
      patients' growth rate, linear growth deficiencies are still common. In pediatric 
      CD patients, prolonged diagnostic delay, high initial activity index, and
      stricturing/penetrating type of behavior may cause growth deficiencies (in weight
      and height) and delayed puberty, with several studies reporting that these
      patients may not reach an optimal bone mass. Glucocorticoids and inflammation
      inhibit bone formation, though their impact on skeletal modeling remains unclear.
      Long-term control of active inflammation and an adequate intake of nutrients are 
      both fundamental in promoting normal puberty. Recent evidence suggests that
      recombinant growth factor therapy is effective in improving short-term linear
      growth in selected patients, but is of limited benefit for ameliorating mucosal
      disease and reducing clinical disease activity. The authors conclude that an
      intense initial treatment (taking a "top-down" approach, with the early
      introduction of immunomodulatory treatment) may be justified to induce and
      maintain remission so that the growth of children with CD can catch up, ideally
      before puberty. Exclusive enteral nutrition has a key role in inducing remission 
      and improving patients' nutritional status.

TI  - Bone marrow Th17 TNFalpha cells induce osteoclast differentiation, and link bone 
      destruction to IBD.
PG  - 1072-81
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306947 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Under both physiological and pathological conditions, bone volume is
      determined by the rate of bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by
      osteoclasts. Excessive bone loss is a common complication of human IBD whose
      mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Despite the role of activated
      CD4(+) T cells in inflammatory bone loss, the nature of the T cell subsets
      involved in this process in vivo remains unknown. The aim of the present study
      was to identify the CD4(+) T cell subsets involved in the process of
      osteoclastogenesis in vivo, as well as their mechanism of action. DESIGN: CD4(+) 
      T cells were studied in IL10-/- mice and Rag1-/- mice adoptively transferred with
      naive CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells, representing two well-characterised animal
      models of IBD and in patients with Crohn's disease. They were phenotypically and 
      functionally characterised by flow cytometric and gene expression analysis, as
      well as in in vitro cocultures with osteoclast precursors. RESULTS: In mice, we
      identified bone marrow (BM) CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin (IL)-17 and
      tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as an osteoclastogenic T cell subset referred 
      to as Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells. During chronic inflammation, these cells migrate
      to the BM where they survive in an IL-7-dependent manner and where they promote
      the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, the main osteoclast progenitors. A
      population equivalent to the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells was also detected in
      patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the
      osteoclastogenic function of the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells that contribute to bone 
      loss in vivo in IBD.

LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3375-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of
      depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications.
      METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on
      immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or
      immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease
      activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple 
      Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were
      obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS:
      Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease
      symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140
      days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients
      started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased
      PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant 
      decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP
      were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 
      9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to
      severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease
      51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores
      decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive
      therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved
      significantly.

TI  - Carbohydrate intake in the etiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2013-21
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
      In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates,
      sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few
      prospective studies have investigated the associations between these
      macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998.
      At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured 
      using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored
      identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with
      4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, 
      sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and 
      smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants
      developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the
      lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to
      3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across
      quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no
      associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P
      trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:
      The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many
      case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As
      there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an
      etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work
      should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a
      macronutrient effect.

TI  - The ATG16L1-T300A allele impairs clearance of pathosymbionts in the inflamed
      ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 1546-52

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic,
      microbial and environmental factors. ATG16L1 is an important genetic factor
      involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial
      components from the gut. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the
      composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of CD patients in relation to the
      ATG16L1 risk status. DESIGN: Biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and
      non-inflamed regions of the terminal ileum of 11 CD patients homozygous for the
      ATG16L1 risk allele (ATG16L1-T300A) and 9 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 
      protective allele (ATG16L1-T300). Biopsy DNA was extracted and the bacterial
      composition analysed by pyrosequencing. Intracellular survival rates of
      adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) were analysed by determining colony
      forming units after exposure to monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers
      homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk or protective allele. RESULTS: Inflamed ileal
      tissue from patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele contained increased
      numbers of Fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal tissue of patients homozygous
      for the ATG16L1 protective allele showed decreased numbers of Bacteroidaceae and 
      Enterobacteriaceae and increased Lachnospiraceae. The ATG16L1 allele did not
      affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed ileal tissue. Monocytes
      homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele showed impaired killing of AIEC under
      inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective
      allele. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele
      show impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that
      ATG16L1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon
      inflammation.

TI  - Development of the Lemann index to assess digestive tract damage in patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 52-63.e3
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2014.09.015 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(14)01137-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a need for a scoring system that provides a
      comprehensive assessment of structural bowel damage, including stricturing
      lesions, penetrating lesions, and surgical resection, for measuring disease
      progression. We developed the Lemann Index and assessed its ability to measure
      cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, international, cross-sectional 
      study of patients with CD evaluated at 24 centers in 15 countries. Inclusions
      were stratified based on CD location and duration. All patients underwent
      clinical examination and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging analyses. Upper
      endoscopy, colonoscopy, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging analyses were
      performed according to suspected disease locations. The digestive tract was
      divided into 4 organs and subsequently into segments. For each segment,
      investigators collected information on previous operations, predefined
      strictures, and/or penetrating lesions of maximal severity (grades 1-3), and then
      provided damage evaluations ranging from 0.0 (no lesion) to 10.0 (complete
      resection). Overall level of organ damage was calculated from the average of
      segmental damage. Investigators provided a global damage evaluation (from 0.0 to 
      10.0) using calculated organ damage evaluations. Predicted organ indexes and
      Lemann Index were constructed using a multiple linear mixed model, showing the
      best fit with investigator organ and global damage evaluations, respectively. An 
      internal cross-validation was performed using bootstrap methods. RESULTS: Data
      from 138 patients (24, 115, 92, and 59 with upper tract, small bowel,
      colon/rectum, and anus CD location, respectively) were analyzed. According to
      validation, the unbiased correlation coefficients between predicted indexes and
      investigator damage evaluations were 0.85, 0.98, 0.90, 0.82 for upper tract,
      small bowel, colon/rectum, anus, respectively, and 0.84 overall. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      a cross-sectional study, we assessed the ability of the Lemann Index to measure
      cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with CD. Provided further
      successful validation and good sensitivity to change, the index should be used to
      evaluate progression of CD and efficacy of treatment.

TI  - Are alterations of tight junctions at molecular and ultrastructural level
      different in duodenal biopsies of patients with celiac disease and Crohn's
      disease?
PG  - 521-30
LID - 10.1007/s00428-014-1651-1 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins of tight junctions (TJ)
      have been implicated in pathogenesis of both celiac (CeD) and Crohn's diseases
      (CD). Since disease pathogenesis in CeD and CD are different, we planned to study
      if there is any differential expression pattern of TJ marker proteins and
      ultrastructural changes, respectively, in duodenal villi vs crypts. Endoscopic
      duodenal biopsies from treatment naive patients with CeD (n = 24), active CD (n =
      28), and functional dyspepsia (as controls, n = 15), both at baseline and 6
      months after treatment, were subjected to light microscopic analysis (modified
      Marsh grading); immune-histochemical staining and Western blot analysis to see
      the expression of key TJ proteins [trans-membrane proteins (claudin-2, claudin-3,
      claudin-4, occludin, and JAM) and cytoplasmic protein (ZO-1)]. Transmission
      electron microscopy and image analysis of the TJs were also performed. There was 
      significant overexpression of claudin-2 (pore-forming) and occludin (protein
      maintaining cell polarity) with under-expression of claudin-3 and claudin-4
      (pore-sealing proteins) in treatment naive CeD and active CD with simultaneous
      alteration in ultrastructure of TJs such as loss of penta-laminar structure and
      TJ dilatation. Normalization of some of these TJ proteins was noted 6 months
      after treatment. These changes were not disease specific and were not different
      in duodenal villi and crypts. Overexpression of pore-forming and under-expression
      of pore-sealing TJ proteins lead to dilatation of TJ. These changes are neither
      disease specific nor site specific and the end result of mucosal inflammation.

TI  - Nutritional status and growth in Korean children with Crohn's disease: a
      single-center study.
PG  - 500-7
LID - 10.5009/gnl13183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Malnutrition and growth retardation are important issues in
      treating pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Thus, we aimed to investigate the
      prevalence of various nutritional and growth parameters at the time of diagnosis 
      in Korean children with CD. METHODS: Seventy-one children (<18 years) were
      enrolled. We analyzed the Z-scores of height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-height
      (WHZ), body mass index for age (BMIZ), bone mineral density for age (BMDZ), and
      the biochemical markers measured at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: At diagnosis,
      HAZ <-2 was observed in three patients (4%), WHZ <-2 in 20 patients (28%), BMIZ
      <-2 in 19 patients (27%), and BMDZ <-2 in 11 patients (18%). The HAZ was
      significantly lower in females and patients with extraintestinal manifestations, 
      and the WHZ and BMIZ were significantly lower in patients with stricturing and
      penetrating disease. Subnormal serum levels were highly prevalent for hemoglobin,
      albumin, iron, ferritin, calcium, magnesium, folate, vitamin B12, and zinc. There
      was a significant correlation between nutritional status, growth retardation, and
      disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal nutritional status was highly prevalent
      in Korean children with CD at the time of diagnosis and was associated with the
      extent, behavior, and activity of the disease.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis.
      Recent evidence suggests that CD may involve genetic or environmental factors
      that impair the normal innate immune system's ability to contain bacteria to the 
      lumen. Multiple dietary components may impact on the resident flora, diminish or 
      damage the mucous layer, increase intestinal permeability or increase the ability
      of pathobionts to adhere to epithelial cells or translocate across the epithelial
      barrier. This chapter reviews the possible effects of different dietary
      components present in the Western diet to affect bacterial clearance mechanisms, 
      and offers a hypothetical model for an acquired bacterial clearance defect in CD.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease, is linked to significant 
      growth stunting, sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass), deterioration of bone
      architecture and reduction in bone mass. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has
      been shown to correct nutritional deficiencies, provide adequate calories for
      growth, and alleviate intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease with a favorable
      adverse effect profile. In this chapter, we report a summary of the effects of
      EEN on linear growth, skeletal health and lean body mass in children with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition as treatment option for Crohn's disease: in kids only?
PG  - 115-23
LID - 10.1159/000360716 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are characterized by chronic and recurrent
      inflammatory reactions of the intestinal mucosa resulting in progressing
      ulcerating lesions. Research over the past decade clearly identified in patients 
      with Crohn's disease (CD) a marked dysregulation of the intestinal microbiome
      (dysbiosis) as one trigger factor in these inflammatory processes, particularly
      in patients with a high genetic risk. When treating patients with CD, most drugs 
      aim to control the inflammatory process (either by inhibiting inflammatory
      pathways or by reducing the activity of immune cells). Given the importance of
      the disturbed interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system,
      there might be a different therapeutic approach in targeting directly the
      intestinal microflora. There are good data to believe that the use of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN) is one such option. Historically, enteral nutrition (EN) 
      was used as supplemental nutritional therapy in CD patients with planned
      resection surgery. This treatment option showed unexpected and very powerful
      anti-inflammatory effects, and it was rapidly introduced as induction therapy for
      active CD. Several clinical trials and case series confirmed the efficacy of EN
      to induce remission in approximately 80% of patients equaling the potential of
      steroids. It is well established that EN has this strong anti-inflammatory
      potential only when given on an exclusive basis, without any additional food.
      This raises major compliance issues, probably one of the reasons why it is less
      used in adult patients. A recent study demonstrated that EEN has a specific
      effect on the intestinal microbiota, which is markedly different from
      steroid-induced remission, while all patients obtained complete clinical
      remission. These observations give a first basis for the understanding of the
      impact of EEN on dysbiosis in patients with CD.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 11505-24
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11505 [doi]
AB  - It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms
      in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis 
      of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence
      supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central
      role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes
      chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of
      probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic 
      strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different
      immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use 
      of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative
      pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for
      maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated
      barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some
      benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in
      remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are
      disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is
      weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with
      medical therapy in maintenance treatment.

LID - 10.1111/apt.12949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) commonly affect young patients in
      the reproductive phase of their lives. The chronic and relapsing nature of IBD
      and the potential need for medical or surgical interventions raise concerns about
      family planning issues. AIM: To review the current knowledge on IBD management in
      pregnant and nursing IBD patients. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was
      performed using the search terms 'reproduction' and 'inflammatory bowel disease' 
      and using the headers and main subjects of each section of this article as search
      terms. RESULTS: Male and female fertility are not impaired in the majority of IBD
      patients. In IBD patients with quiescent disease pregnancy outcomes are not
      impaired in comparison to the general population, however, an increased incidence
      of pregnancy complications is observed in active IBD patients. As methotrexate
      (MTX) has been demonstrated to be teratogenic, the use of MTX is contraindicated 
      in patients, who wish to conceive, throughout pregnancy and when nursing.
      However, normal pregnancies following MTX treatment at conception and later have 
      been reported. Most of the other currently approved IBD medications are not
      associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be used to maintain quiescent 
      disease or to induce a rapid remission in patients with flares and active
      disease. Breast-feeding in IBD patients is possible and recommended. CONCLUSIONS:
      The overall outcome of pregnancies in IBD patients is favourable and not
      different to healthy controls, thus patients with IBD should not be discouraged
      from having children.

PG  - 323-30
AB  - Frequency of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
      tends to increase in developing countries. Nearly 25% of cases affects pediatric 
      patients. Inflammatory bowel diseases are often associated with weight loss and
      stunting in children. Moreover, weight and height deficiencies are often early
      symptoms. Initially, nonspecific or latent course of disease delays the
      diagnostic process. Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases can be caused by 
      disorders of digestion and nutrients' absorption, intestinal loss, increased
      energy expenditure and appetite impairment. Nutritional deficiencies and
      inflammatory agents lead to disturbance of tissue metabolism - muscle and bone - 
      and retardation of somatic development of affected children. Thus, deficiencies
      of muscle mass, bone mineral density and body height are observed. Insufficient
      normalization of somatic features may be the consequence of recurrent nature of
      disease and specificity of pharmacological treatment. Present work deals with the
      current state of knowledge concerning the somatic development disorders of
      children with inflammatory bowel diseases. Abnormal nutritional status, bone
      mineral density deficits and growth failure of patients have been discussed in
      the context of their relations and dependencies on inflammatory, nutritional and 
      therapeutic factors.

TI  - Effect of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) supplementation for 12 months on the indices
      of vitamin K status and bone health in adult patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1163-74

AB  - Although epidemiological findings support a role for vitamin K status in the
      improvement of bone indices in adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD), this
      needs to be confirmed in double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCT) with
      phylloquinone (vitamin K1). By conducting two RCT, the present study aimed to
      first establish whether supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily
      near-maximally suppresses the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in
      serum (%ucOC; marker of vitamin K status) in adult patients with CD currently in 
      remission as it does in healthy adults and second determine the effect of
      supplementation with phylloquinone at this dose for 12 months on the indices of
      bone turnover and bone mass. The initial dose-ranging RCT was conducted in adult 
      patients with CD (n 10 per group) using 0 (placebo), 1000 or 2000 mug of
      phylloquinone daily for 2 weeks. In the main RCT, the effect of placebo v. 1000
      mug vitamin K/d (both co-administered with Ca (500 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (10
      mug/d)) for 12 months (n 43 per group) on the biochemical indices of bone
      turnover (determined by enzyme immunoassay) and bone mass (determined by
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were investigated. At baseline, the mean %ucOC 
      was 47 %, and this was suppressed upon supplementation with 1000 mug of
      phylloquinone daily ( - 81 %; P< 0.01) and not suppressed further by 2000 mug of 
      phylloquinone daily. Compared with the placebo, supplementation with 1000 mug of 
      phylloquinone daily for 12 months had no significant effect (P>0.1) on bone
      turnover markers or on the bone mass of the lumbar spine or femur, but modestly
      increased (P< 0.05) the bone mass of the total radius. Despite near maximal
      suppression of serum %ucOC, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily 
      (with Ca and vitamin D3) had no effect on the indices of bone health in adult CD 
      patients with likely vitamin K insufficiency.

TI  - Incidence and predictors of clinical response, re-induction dose, and maintenance
      dose escalation with certolizumab pegol in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1722-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol (CERT) is indicated for reducing the signs and
      symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response. Patients
      losing response received an extra "capture" re-induction dose in the PRECiSE 4
      study. We examined the use of certolizumab in a retrospective cohort of patients 
      with CD at a single inflammatory bowel disease center. METHODS: We conducted a
      retrospective chart review of all adult patients with CD treated with CERT at the
      University of Chicago from April 22, 2008 to May 1, 2011. Demographics, disease
      characteristics, inflammatory bowel disease therapies, surgeries, CERT dosing,
      and clinical outcomes were recorded. Predictors of clinical response,
      re-induction dosing, and maintenance dose escalation were evaluated. Univariate, 
      multivariate, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for predictive variables
      of clinical response, re-induction dosing, and maintenance dose increases.
      RESULTS: One hundred ten patients were identified; 23 were excluded. The
      remaining 87 patients had a sustained clinical response of 31.0%, remission of
      14.9%, minimal or no response of 31.0%; 37.9% initially responded but lost
      response. In total, 35.6% of patients received a single re-induction dose of 400 
      mg after a mean of 29 weeks, predicted by prior anti-tumor necrosis factor (P =
      0.007) and absence of perianal disease (P = 0.006); only 5 patients (16.1%)
      maintained a durable response or remission; 11.5% increased maintenance dosage
      after a mean of 50 weeks; all but 1 subsequently stopped CERT. CONCLUSIONS: Some 
      patients with CD (31%) achieved a sustained response. The majority of patients
      receiving re-induction dosing did not achieve a sustained clinical response.
      Previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was associated with
      reduced responses, suggesting that CERT may be more effective as an initial
      anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.

TI  - Chronic intestinal failure after Crohn disease: when to perform transplantation.
PG  - 1060-6
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2014.1072 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Because of the severity of disease and additional surgery, Crohn
      disease (CD) may result in intestinal failure (IF) and dependency on home
      parenteral nutrition (HPN). Defining the indication and timing for intestinal
      transplantation (ITx) is challenging. OBJECTIVES: To determine the limitations of
      conventional surgery and to facilitate the decision making for transplantation.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected prospectively and obtained
      by retrospective review of medical records from all patients with CD who were
      assessed for ITx in Oxford, United Kingdom, and Berlin, Germany, from October 10,
      2003, through July 31, 2013. Patients were considered suitable for ITx if a
      diagnosis of irreversible IF was established and life-threatening complications
      under HPN were unresolvable. Twenty patients with CD and IF, established on HPN, 
      were evaluated for ITx. The mean (SD) age at CD onset was 17.8 (9.8) years. On
      first diagnosis, most patients had a stricturing CD. By the time of referral,
      most had a combination of stricturing and fistulizing disease. INTERVENTIONS: New
      scoring system: a modification of the American Gastroenterology Association
      guidelines for ITx. Modifications are related to CD-specific issues that
      potentially lead to a poorer outcome and are based on the findings of the study
      to determine the expected benefit from ITx. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A scoring
      system that would alert the physician to the severity of the patient's CD and
      trigger early referral for ITx. This system may translate into better long-term
      outcomes for patients with CD. In addition, the Karnofsky performance status
      score was used to compare pretransplantation and posttransplantation outcomes.
      RESULTS: Ten patients underwent ITx, 4 were on the waiting list, and 4 were
      unavailable for follow-up. One patient was taken off the waiting list because of 
      severe deterioration. One patient underwent conventional stricturoplasty and did 
      not need transplantation. Among the transplant recipients, 17 (85%) had a stoma
      or enterocutaneous fistula, and the mean (SD) residual bowel length was 71.5 (38)
      cm. A total of 80% of transplant recipients had life-threatening catheter
      infections, and 13 (65%) had a significant decrease in the estimated glomerular
      filtration rate. At a mean (SD) follow-up of 27.6 (36.1) months for transplant
      recipients, the patient and graft survival is 80%, and their Karnofsky
      performance status score increased by a mean of 18.6%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      Intestinal transplantation is a suitable treatment option for patients with CD
      and IF. It should be considered before any additional attempts at conventional
      surgery, which may cause eligible patients to miss this opportunity through
      perioperative complications. The suggested scoring system enables the physician
      to identify patients who may benefit from transplantation before HPN-associated
      secondary organ failure.

TI  - Two-stage genome-wide methylation profiling in childhood-onset Crohn's Disease
      implicates epigenetic alterations at the VMP1/MIR21 and HLA loci.
PG  - 1784-93
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a result of technological and analytical advances, genome-wide
      characterization of key epigenetic alterations is now feasible in complex
      diseases. We hypothesized that this may provide important insights into
      gene-environmental interactions in Crohn's disease (CD) and is especially
      pertinent to early onset disease. METHODS: The Illumina 450K platform was applied
      to assess epigenome-wide methylation profiles in circulating leukocyte DNA in
      discovery and replication pediatric CD cohorts and controls. Data were corrected 
      for differential leukocyte proportions. Targeted replication was performed in
      adults using pyrosequencing. Methylation changes were correlated with gene
      expression in blood and intestinal mucosa. RESULTS: We identified 65 individual
      CpG sites with methylation alterations achieving epigenome-wide significance
      after Bonferroni correction (P < 1.1 x 10(-7)), and 19 differently methylated
      regions displaying unidirectional methylation change. There was a highly
      significant enrichment of methylation changes around GWAS single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (P = 3.7 x 10(-7)), notably the HLA region and MIR21. Two-locus
      discriminant analysis in the discovery cohort predicted disease in the pediatric 
      replication cohort with high accuracy (area under the curve, 0.98). The findings 
      strongly implicate the transcriptional start site of MIR21 as a region of
      extended epigenetic alteration, containing the most significant individual probes
      (P = 1.97 x 10(-15)) within a GWAS risk locus. In extension studies, we confirmed
      hypomethylation of MIR21 in adults (P = 6.6 x 10(-5), n = 172) and show increased
      mRNA expression in leukocytes (P < 0.005, n = 66) and in the inflamed intestine
      (P = 1.4 x 10(-6), n = 99). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate highly significant and
      replicable differences in DNA methylation in CD, defining the disease-associated 
      epigenome. The data strongly implicate known GWAS loci, with compelling evidence 
      implicating MIR21 and the HLA region.

TI  - Obstructed ileostomy in the third trimester of pregnancy due to compression from 
      the gravid uterus: diagnosis and management.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2014-205884 [doi]
LID - bcr2014205884 [pii]
AB  - Ileostomy obstruction in pregnancy, although rare, is a significant complication 
      with associated morbidity and mortality. Early studies recommended immediate
      surgical intervention for cases of ileostomy obstruction in pregnancy. We present
      a case of ileostomy obstruction at 29-week gestation in which a laparotomy was
      performed for presumed adhesions. When adhesiolysis failed to resolve the
      obstruction, it became clear that the obstruction was caused by external
      compression from the enlarging gravid uterus. The remainder of the pregnancy was 
      successfully managed by daily aspiration of bowel contents using a large bore
      drainage tube, and total parental nutrition. Recent studies have utilised MRI to 
      distinguish between adhesions and uterine compression as the cause of ileostomy
      obstruction in pregnancy. In the few cases of obstruction caused by uterine
      compression, patients have been safely managed with conservative therapy, thereby
      avoiding the risks of surgery.

AB  - The role of radiologic evaluation in Crohn's disease (CD) has undergone a recent 
      paradigm shift in which the radiologist adds value to the multidisciplinary team 
      by longitudinally assessing therapeutic response and identifying
      treatment-modifying subtypes, such as fibrostenotic or fistulizing disease.
      Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has become the primary imaging modality
      used. The combination of multiplanar, multiparametric, and multiphasic
      contrast-enhanced imaging with the high spatial resolution and very high tissue
      contrast of MR imaging allows for detailed evaluation of intra-abdominal
      pathology, without the risk of cumulative radiation exposure. MRE provides the
      benefit of a complete evaluation of mural, extramural, and even extraintestinal
      manifestations and complications of CD in a single examination. Cine motility
      sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging may further increase sensitivity and
      specificity. MRE represents an ideal imaging modality for initial evaluation,
      assessment of therapeutic response, and evaluation of complications in patients
      with CD.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0104706 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Markers that predict the occurrence of a complicated disease behavior
      in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) can permit a more aggressive therapeutic
      regimen for patients at risk. The aim of this cohort study was to test the blood 
      levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) for the prediction of complicated
      CD behavior and CD related surgery in an adult patient population. METHODS: Blood
      samples of 62 CD patients of the German Inflammatory Bowel Disease-network
      "Kompetenznetz CED" were tested for the levels of Hgb and Hct prior to the
      occurrence of complicated disease behavior or CD related surgery. The relation of
      these markers and clinical events was studied using Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis and adjusted COX-proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: The
      median follow-up time was 55.8 months. Of the 62 CD patients without any previous
      complication or surgery 34% developed a complication and/or underwent CD related 
      surgery. Low Hgb or Hct levels were independent predictors of a shorter time to
      occurrence of the first complication or CD related surgery. This was true for
      early as well as late occurring complications. Stable low Hgb or Hct during
      serial follow-up measurements had a higher frequency of complications compared to
      patients with a stable normal Hgb or Hct, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Determination of Hgb or Hct in complication and surgery naive CD patients might
      serve as an additional tool for the prediction of complicated disease behavior.

TI  - Long-term outcome of enterocutaneous fistula in patients with Crohn's disease
      treated with anti-TNF therapy: a cohort study from the GETAID.
PG  - 1443-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is the treatment of
      choice for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD), the efficacy and safety of 
      anti-TNF therapy in enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) remains unclear. METHODS:
      Between January 2008 and December 2009, we retrospectively reviewed the outcomes 
      of all CD patients with ECF (excluding perianal fistula) treated with anti-TNF
      therapy followed up in Groupe d'Etude Therapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires
      du tube Digestif (GETAID) centers. ECF closure and tolerance of anti-TNF therapy 
      were studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Forty-eight
      patients (twenty-six women; median age 34.6 (interquartile range=25.0-45.5)
      years) were included in this study. The median follow-up period was 3.0 (2.0-6.6)
      years. The fistula was located in the small bowel (n=38), duodenum (n=1), and
      colon (n=9). The fistula has been developed in ileocolonic anastomosis in 17
      (35%) cases. Sixteen patients (33%) had complex fistulas with multiple tracts and
      eleven patients (23%) had a high ECF output (if wearing an ostomy bag). Complete 
      ECF closure was achieved in 16 (33%) patients, of whom eight relapsed during the 
      follow-up period. In multivariate analysis, complete ECF closure was associated
      with the absence of multiple ECF tracts and associated stenosis. An abdominal
      abscess developed in 15 (31%) patients. ECF resection was needed in 26 (54%)
      patients. One patient died after surgery owing to abdominal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In CD patients with ECF, anti-TNF therapy may be effective in up to one-third of 
      patients, especially in the absence of stenosis and complex fistula. A careful
      selection of patients is mandatory to prevent treatment failure and improves the 
      safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Growth retardation is a frequent complication of paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only a few studies report the final height of
      these patients, with controversial results. We compared adult height of patients 
      with paediatric IBD with that of patients with adult-onset disease. METHODS:
      Height data of 675 women 19-44 years of age and 454 men 23-44 years of age
      obtained at inclusion in the Swiss IBD cohort study registry were grouped
      according to the age at diagnosis: (a) prepubertal (men</=13, women</=11 years), 
      (b) pubertal (men 13-22, women 11-18 years) and (c) adult (men>22, women>18 years
      of age), and compared with each other and with healthy controls. RESULTS: Male
      patients with prepubertal onset of Crohn's disease (CD) had significantly lower
      final height (mean 172+/-6 cm, range 161-182) compared with men with pubertal
      (179+/-6 cm, 161-192) or adult (178+/-7 cm, 162-200) age at onset and the general
      population (178+/-7 cm, 142-204). Height z-scores standardized against heights of
      the normal population were significantly lower in all patients with a prepubertal
      diagnosis of CD (-0.8+/-0.9) compared with the other patient groups (-0.1+/-0.8, 
      P<0.001). Prepubertal onset of CD emerged as a risk factor for reduced final
      height in patients with prepubertal CD. No difference for final height was found 
      between patients with ulcerative or unclassified IBD diagnosed at prepubertal,
      pubertal or adult age. CONCLUSION: Prepubertal onset of CD is a risk for lower
      final height, independent of the initial disease location and the necessity for
      surgical interventions.

AB  - Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with
      inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often
      develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or
      histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD
      unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance
      pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic
      defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and 
      adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype.
      Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and 
      are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of
      these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and 
      often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on
      standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is
      required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate 
      treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic 
      analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We
      describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic
      variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we
      provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We
      also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting 
      with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate
      genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using
      next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic
      defects.

TI  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children: an update for 2014.
PG  - 266-70
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12685 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian
      children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more
      often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in
      children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although 
      many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody
      diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short
      stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have
      altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and
      pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children
      presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic
      delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD
      encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child
      and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.

TI  - Intractable diarrhea of infancy: 10 years of experience.
PG  - 571-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000485 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI), a group of prolonged diarrheal
      disorders, is difficult to diagnose and manage. We documented general features of
      patients and the causes of IDI. METHODS: The present retrospective study included
      60 hospitalized patients with IDI ages 0 to 24 months during January 2000 to
      December 2010. Detailed history, laboratory and endoscopic findings, diagnoses,
      and clinical courses were reviewed. Descriptive analyses were used for
      statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.4. The median age at
      onset of diarrhea was 12 days. A total of 70% and 11% of patients were severely
      and moderately malnourished, respectively. Carbohydrate malabsorption (CM) and
      food allergies (n = 11, 18% for both) were the most frequent causes. A total of
      16 of the patients (27%) did not have a specific diagnosis. The other diagnoses
      were infections (n = 5), immune-mediated disorders (IMD) (n = 6), congenital
      enterocyte defects (CED) (n = 3, 5%), short bowel syndrome (n = 2), cystic
      fibrosis (n = 2), intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 1), congenital disorder of
      glycosylation (n = 1), abetalipoproteinemia (n = 1), and proprotein convertase
      (PC) 1 deficiency (n = 1). Stool calprotectin level was high in 10 of 19 patients
      with Crohn disease (n = 3, mean 1116 +/- 851 mg/L), food allergy (n = 4, mean 516
      +/- 288 mg/L), and undefined etiology (n = 3, mean 616 +/- 780 mg/L). The mean
      duration of hospitalization was 76 days. CONCLUSIONS: IDI is a heterogeneous
      group of diarrheal disorders. The most frequent causes were CM and food allergies
      in our study. Because high levels of calprotectin support inflammation,
      calprotectin levels may help to discriminate CED and inflammatory causes of IDI.

TI  - Association of levels of antibodies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      with extracellular proteins of food and probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 351204
LID - 10.1155/2014/351204 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a
      chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an
      abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has
      been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against
      extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed,
      by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG)
      developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food
      bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera
      collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease
      patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of
      IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei
      subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; 
      n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA
      antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients 
      appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the 
      basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association
      of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food
      and probiotic bacteria.

PG  - 1341-5
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) use as an alternative to thiopurines in the
      treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) in children is increasing. This study was
      undertaken to assess safety and efficacy of MTX in children with CD. METHODS:
      Patients treated with MTX with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were identified in
      the Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group Registry, a prospective inception 
      cohort study started in 2002. The clinical efficacy and safety of MTX were
      analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety patients treated with MTX
      were identified. One hundred seventy-two patients received at least 3 months of
      MTX without thiopurine or biologicals and had >/=1 year of follow-up. Eighty-one 
      of 172 patients (47%) received MTX as first immunomodulator (IMM), of which 22
      (27%) achieved >/=12 months of sustained clinical remission without surgery,
      thiopurine, biologicals, or corticosteroids. Those receiving MTX as second IMM
      achieved similar remission rate (35%, P = not significant). Fourteen percent
      received MTX as first IMM in 2002 and 60% in 2010 (P = 0.005). Disease location
      did not affect outcomes. MTX doses were equivalent in both groups. Fifteen
      percent of patients developed an alanine aminotransferase >60 international
      units/liter and 12% developed a white blood cell <4000 cells per microliter while
      on MTX. Only 4% of these discontinued MTX completely. A small group of 6 centers,
      which contributed only about one-third of patients with CD in the registry,
      contributed nearly two-thirds of the patients receiving MTX (P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: MTX use as first choice IMM is increasing in pediatric CD. MTX
      provided sustained clinical remission in nearly one-third of patients with
      minimal toxicity. There is large center-to-center variability in its use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition is effective for inducing remission in
      active pediatric Crohn's disease. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with free diet 
      is ineffective for inducing remission, suggesting that the mechanism depends on
      exclusion of free diet. We developed an alternative diet based on PEN with
      exclusion of dietary components hypothesized to affect the microbiome or
      intestinal permeability. METHODS: Children and young adults with active disease
      defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index >7.5 or Harvey-Bradshaw
      index >/=4 received a 6-week structured Crohn's disease exclusion diet that
      allowed access to specific foods and restricted exposure to all other foods, and 
      up to 50% of dietary calories from a polymeric formula. Remission, C-reactive
      protien, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reevaluated at 6 weeks. The
      primary endpoint was remission at 6 weeks defined as Harvey-Bradshaw index </=3
      for all patients and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <7.5 in children.
      RESULTS: We treated 47 patients (mean age, 16.1 +/- 5.6 yr; 34 children).
      Response and remission were obtained in 37 (78.7%) and 33 (70.2%) patients,
      respectively. Mean pediatric Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 27.7
      +/- 9.4 to 5.4 +/- 8 (P < 0.001), Harvey-Bradshaw index from 6.4 +/- 2.7 to 1.8
      +/- 2.9 (P < 0.001). Remission was obtained in 70% of children and 69% of adults.
      Normalization of previously elevated CRP occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients in
      remission. Seven patients used the diet without PEN; 6 of 7 obtained remission.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dietary therapy involving PEN with an exclusion diet seems to lead
      to high remission rates in early mild-to-moderate luminal Crohn's disease in
      children and young adults.

AB  - We sought to determine whether extremely-early-onset childhood inflammatory bowel
      disease (age <6 years; 20 ulcerative colitis [UC], 8 Crohn disease [CD], 2
      indeterminate, sequentially diagnosed) was clinically more severe than in older
      children (6-17 years; 19 UC, 39 CD, 2 indeterminate). Early-onset UC was marked
      by less abdominal pain at presentation, but an aggressive course with a
      significant reduction in weight-for-age, increased use of immunosuppressants, and
      more surgery. Children with early-onset CD were more likely to have bloody stools
      at presentation and an isolated colitis. This study supports the suggestion that 
      inflammatory bowel disease phenotype differs in early-onset disease.

TI  - Crohn's disease: rehabilitation after resection.
PG  - 395-8
LID - 10.1159/000358144 [doi]
AB  - In general, the patient receiving surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) makes an
      uncomplicated recovery with a speed consistent with the degree of surgical
      'insult' - which in these days of laparoscopic approach and minimalist resection 
      often means very rapidly indeed. However, in the patient who has had repeated
      surgery and in those where there was profound intra-abdominal sepsis this may not
      be the case. A prolonged period of ileus is to be expected and patients may well 
      require parenteral nutrition to support them through this time. A curious and
      incompletely understood form of functional short-bowel syndrome is also seen in
      these and other patients after CD resection. Despite apparently limited resection
      and known adequate residual bowel length, with more than 1.5 m of healthy small
      intestine remaining in continuity, some patients develop a high-output state with
      many litres of diarrhoea or stomal effluent each day. Fortunately, in most cases 
      this resolves spontaneously, but the process may take months: again these
      individuals may need parenteral nutrition support (including home parenteral
      nutrition in some). Nutritional support is needed in a broader range of
      postoperative patients, however, and it is increasingly recognised that simply
      providing supplements and encouraging eating will not be enough to restore lean
      body mass and function unless it is combined with an exercise programme. Analogy 
      with sports training helps both physicians and patients understand this better.
      The patient who has undergone CD surgery has often been ill for some time
      beforehand, and the psychological aspects of chronic disease and the changes
      brought about by surgery - especially the creation of a stoma - may themselves
      become the most prominent features of the rehabilitative phase. A
      multidisciplinary approach is clearly justified and should be made available to
      all post-operative patients as needed.

TI  - Dietary clues to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 389-94
LID - 10.1159/000358143 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis with
      environmental, genetic and microbial factors involved in the development of the
      disease. A remarkable feature of this disease in childhood is the effective
      response to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy and the need for complete
      exclusion of normal diet required for success (principle of exclusivity). EEN or 
      dietary interventions might act through removal of dietary components, which
      affect microbial composition, decrease a proinflammatory response and promote
      restitution of the epithelial barrier, likewise allowing termination of this
      vicious disease-forming cycle before a critical threshold is reached. Multiple
      traditional and nontraditional dietary components may affect the microbiome,
      mucous layer, intestinal permeability, or adherence and translocation of
      pathobionts. We review the epidemiological data, as well as data from animal
      models and cell lines, and propose a model for pathogenesis we have termed the
      'bacterial penetration cycle', whereby dietary components such as animal fat,
      high sugar intake and gliadin, and consumption of emulsifiers, maltodextrin as
      well as low-fiber diets may be able to cause a localized acquired bacterial
      clearance defect, leading to bacterial adhesion and penetration, and subsequently
      inflammation in the gut.

LID - 10.1159/000358133 [doi]
AB  - Similar to adults, there is heterogeneous phenotypic expression of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) in children. Thus, a classification system for disease
      characteristics is obligatory if one seeks to understand and eventually change
      the natural history of IBD. Extrapolation of adult clinical trial results to
      children also depends upon comparable classifications of disease. Features that
      can differentiate IBD in children from adults include more extensive and severe
      disease at presentation, frequent corticosteroid dependency, change in location
      and behavior over time, and the implications of disease for growth and sexual
      maturation. In contrast to the Montreal classification where all patients <17
      years were grouped together, the Paris classification recognizes the different
      expression of pediatric IBD between those patients aged <10 years and those 10-17
      years of age. The recent identification of monogenic disorders in very young
      children (<2 years) with severe IBD-like disease has further clouded the issue of
      where appropriate pediatric age guidelines should be drawn, though it is clear
      these infantile-onset cases should not be grouped with older children. The Paris 
      classification recognizes the importance of upper tract disease on natural
      history by dividing it into L4a and L4b (proximal and distal to the ligament of
      Treitz, respectively), while the Montreal system groups all upper-tract patients 
      together. Complicated disease behavior in the Montreal system mandated a single
      category preventing the concomitant designation as stricturing and penetrating,
      whereas the Paris classification recognizes that both stricturing and penetrating
      behavior may occur at the same or different times. Growth delay is recognized
      only in the Paris classification as a serious manifestation of IBD in children
      affecting therapeutic decisions. As our understanding of the basic molecular
      mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in IBD changes over time, it is likely that
      the IBD classification will change as well. A single classification system that
      reflects both pediatric and adult disease is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Paris pediatric modification of the Montreal
      classification defines very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) as a
      form of IBD distinct from that of older children. We compared the incidence and
      outcomes of VEO-IBD with those of IBD in older children. METHODS: We performed a 
      population-based retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with IBD in
      Ontario, Canada, from 1994 through 2009. Trends in standardized incidence were
      calculated using Poisson regression. We compared outpatient and emergency
      department visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries among children diagnosed with 
      IBD when they were younger than age 6, ages 6-9.9, and older than age 10 years.
      Multivariable models were adjusted for income and stratified by sex. RESULTS: The
      incidence of IBD increased from 9.4 per 100,000 children (95% confidence interval
      [CI], 8.2-10.8/100,000 children) in 1994 to 13.2 per 100,000 children (95% CI,
      11.9-14.6/100,000 children) in 2009 (P < .0001). The incidence increased by 7.4% 
      per year among children younger than 6 years old and 6-9.9 years old, and by 2.2%
      per year among children >/=10 years old. IBD-related outpatient visits were less 
      frequent among children <6 years old than >/=10 years old (odds ratio for female 
      patients, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.78; odds ratio for male patients, 0.86; 95% CI,
      0.75-0.98). Hazard ratios [HRs] for hospitalization were lower for children <6
      years old (female HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; male HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.94-1.33) 
      than for older children. HRs for surgery among children <6 years old with Crohn's
      disease were 0.35 for female patients (95% CI, 0.16-0.78) and 0.59 for male
      patients (95% CI, 0.34-0.99). HRs for children <6 years old with ulcerative
      colitis were 0.88 for female patients (95% CI, 0.47-1.63) and 0.42 for male
      patients (95% CI, 0.21-0.85). There was no difference in hospitalization or
      surgery rates among children 6-9.9 years old vs those >/=10 years old.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective cohort study, the incidence of VEO-IBD
      increased from 1994 through 2009. Children diagnosed with IBD before they were 6 
      years old used fewer health services and had lower rates of surgery than children
      diagnosed when they were 10 years or older.

TI  - DNA methylation-associated colonic mucosal immune and defense responses in
      treatment-naive pediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1131-7
LID - 10.4161/epi.29446 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are emerging globally, indicating that
      environmental factors may be important in their pathogenesis. Colonic mucosal
      epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can occur in response to the
      environment and have been implicated in IBD pathology. However, mucosal DNA
      methylation has not been examined in treatment-naive patients. We studied DNA
      methylation in untreated, left sided colonic biopsy specimens using the Infinium 
      HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We analyzed 22 control (C) patients, 15
      untreated Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 9 untreated ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      patients from two cohorts. Samples obtained at the time of clinical remission
      from two of the treatment-naive UC patients were also included into the analysis.
      UC-specific gene expression was interrogated in a subset of adjacent samples (5 C
      and 5 UC) using the Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Arrays.
      Only treatment-naive UC separated from control. One-hundred-and-twenty genes with
      significant expression change in UC (> 2-fold, P<0.05) were associated with
      differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Epigenetically associated gene
      expression changes (including gene expression changes in the IFITM1, ITGB2,
      S100A9, SLPI, SAA1, and STAT3 genes) were linked to colonic mucosal immune and
      defense responses. These findings underscore the relationship between epigenetic 
      changes and inflammation in pediatric treatment-naive UC and may have potential
      etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic relevance for IBD.

TI  - Effectiveness of anti-TNFalpha for Crohn disease: research in a pediatric
      learning health system.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.1542/peds.2013-4103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: ImproveCareNow (ICN) is the largest pediatric learning health system 
      in the nation and started as a quality improvement collaborative. To test the
      feasibility and validity of using ICN data for clinical research, we evaluated
      the effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFalpha) agents in
      the management of pediatric Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: Data were collected in
      35 pediatric gastroenterology practices (April 2007 to March 2012) and analyzed
      as a sequence of nonrandomized trials. Patients who had moderate to severe CD
      were classified as initiators or non-initiators of anti-TNFalpha therapy. Among
      4130 patients who had pediatric CD, 603 were new users and 1211 were receiving
      anti-TNFalpha therapy on entry into ICN. RESULTS: During a 26-week follow-up
      period, rate ratios obtained from Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for 
      patient and disease characteristics and concurrent medications, were 1.53 (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.96) for clinical remission and 1.74 (95% CI,
      1.33-2.29) for corticosteroid-free remission. The rate ratio for
      corticosteroid-free remission was comparable to the estimate produced by the
      adult SONIC study, which was a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of
      anti-TNFalpha therapy. The number needed to treat was 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4-11.1) for 
      clinical remission and 5.0 (95% CI, 3.4-10.0) for corticosteroid-free remission. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In routine pediatric gastroenterology practice settings,
      anti-TNFalpha therapy was effective at achieving clinical and corticosteroid-free
      remission for patients who had Crohn disease. Using data from the ICN learning
      health system for the purpose of observational research is feasible and produces 
      valuable new knowledge.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We previously reported our experience with standard laparoscopic
      ileocecectomy, but we have recently used a single-incision laparoscopic approach.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a single surgeon's
      experience from 2009 to 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children 11-18 years of age
      (mean, 15.5 years) with a mean body mass index of 18.9+/-3 kg/m(2) underwent
      single-incision laparoscopic ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease. Mean operative
      time was 86.5+/-25.9 minutes (range, 56-166 minutes). There were no extra ports
      placed or conversions to open surgery. Five children (18%) were on parenteral
      nutrition at time of surgery, 14 (50%) were on steroids, and 9 (32%) were on
      tumor necrotic factor inhibitors. A stapled extracorporeal anastomosis was
      performed in all children. Complications included abscess (n=4), small bowel
      obstruction (n=3), superficial wound infection (n=3), and small bowel perforation
      (n=1). Some patients had more than one complication. Of those with complications,
      5 (56%) were on steroids, 5 (56%) were on tumor necrotic factor inhibitors, and 1
      patient was on both. The perforation occurred at a point of adhesiolysis also
      involved with Crohn's disease. There were no anastomotic leaks. Median follow-up 
      was 17 months (range, 1-47 months). CONCLUSIONS: Single-incision laparoscopic
      ileocecectomy is safe and feasible in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Pancreatitis-associated protein has no additional value as a marker of disease
      activity in a real-life cohort of IBD patients.
PG  - 902-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal
      inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that
      pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD
      subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with
      clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD
      cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were 
      enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or
      the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As
      surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or
      calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured
      by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's
      disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with
      inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease 
      by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more
      than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not
      fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients.
      Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was
      0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the
      combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP
      was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal
      inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the
      diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to
      have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic, progressive and disabling condition. New
      therapeutic goals have emerged in Crohn's disease such as the need to look beyond
      symptoms by achieving mucosal healing that is known to be associated with better 
      outcomes. Anti-TNF (Tumour Necrosis Factor) therapy is the most potent drug class
      to induce and maintain mucosal healing in Crohn's disease. Recent evidence
      indicates that the efficacy profile of thiopurines has been overestimated while
      the increased risk of malignancies (lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, myeloid 
      disorders) has been underestimated. Methotrexate is well-tolerated, but its
      potential for disease modification is unknown. Achieving mucosal healing in
      patients with early Crohn's disease might be the best way to change disease
      course and patients' life. In 2014, anti-TNF treatment should be the first-line
      therapy in patients with Crohn's disease who suffer from severe and/or
      complicated disease and in those with poor prognostic factors. In the remaining
      patients, a rapid step-up approach based on a tight monitoring is recommended.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic incurable condition that normally requires lifelong 
      treatment. Whilst the anti-TNF agents have revolutionised the management of
      Crohn's disease over the last fifteen years, they are not a panacea. In
      particular, in part due to their immunogenic nature, loss of response limits
      their long term effectiveness in many patients. The only other long term
      disease-modifying options are the immunomodulators, methotrexate, azathioprine
      and mercaptopurine. Therefore, given the limited number of drugs available to
      treat Crohn's disease, it is important that efforts are made to ensure that drugs
      are used in the best way possible as once a drug is deemed ineffective, it is
      rarely used again. For the growing number of patients who have active disease
      despite having been exposed to all standard therapies, failure to optimise drug
      therapy may lead to missed opportunities in the management of their disease. In
      this review, optimisation of drugs commonly used in the management of Crohn's
      disease will be discussed.

AB  - Children and adolescents with Crohn's disease (CD) present often with a more
      complicated disease course compared to adult patients. In addition, the potential
      impact of CD on growth, pubertal and emotional development of patients underlines
      the need for a specific management strategy of pediatric-onset CD. To develop the
      first evidenced based and consensus driven guidelines for pediatric-onset CD an
      expert panel of 33 IBD specialists was formed after an open call within the
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society of Pediatric
      Gastroenterolog, Hepatology and Nutrition. The aim was to base on a thorough
      review of existing evidence a state of the art guidance on the medical treatment 
      and long term management of children and adolescents with CD, with individualized
      treatment algorithms based on a benefit-risk analysis according to different
      clinical scenarios. In children and adolescents who did not have finished their
      growth, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the induction therapy of first
      choice due to its excellent safety profile, preferable over corticosteroids,
      which are equipotential to induce remission. The majority of patients with
      pediatric-onset CD require immunomodulator based maintenance therapy. The experts
      discuss several factors potentially predictive for poor disease outcome (such as 
      severe perianal fistulizing disease, severe stricturing/penetrating disease,
      severe growth retardation, panenteric disease, persistent severe disease despite 
      adequate induction therapy), which may incite to an anti-TNF-based top down
      approach. These guidelines are intended to give practical (whenever possible
      evidence-based) answers to (pediatric) gastroenterologists who take care of
      children and adolescents with CD; they are not meant to be a rule or legal
      standard, since many different clinical scenario exist requiring treatment
      strategies not covered by or different from these guidelines.

TI  - Impaired innate immune function associated with fecal supernatant from Crohn's
      disease patients: insights into potential pathogenic role of the microbiome.
PG  - 1139-46
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome plays a role in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), the functional implication is unclear. We
      sought to determine the influence of fecal supernatant from patients with CD on
      innate immune function in neutrophil, macrophage, and epithelial cells.
      Metabolomic analysis was subsequently performed in an attempt to identify
      potential compounds responsible for the effects identified. METHODS: In the fecal
      samples from 11 pediatric patients with CD and 10 healthy controls, 16S ribosomal
      and metabolomic analyses were performed. We evaluated the effect of preincubation
      with fecal supernatant on neutrophil, macrophage, epithelial cell survival,
      superoxide production, bacterial invasion, and/or bactericidal function using
      gentamicin protection assay. Ten substances identified as most elevated in CD
      compared with control samples by metabolomic analysis were similarly tested for
      effect on bactericidal function. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant
      differences in microbial membership in fecal samples from patients with CD
      compared with healthy controls. However, bactericidal function was impaired in
      neutrophils and monocytes preincubated with supernatant from fecal samples from
      patients with CD. Although levels of many metabolites were noted to be altered in
      samples from patients with CD, the combination of the 10 most elevated compounds 
      failed to demonstrate any effect on neutrophil bactericidal capacity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Fecal supernatant from patients with CD impairs intracellular
      bactericidal activity in neutrophils and macrophages. The functional consequences
      of the intestinal microbiome and its associated secreted products on innate
      immune function may be more critical than microbial membership in understanding
      the pathophysiology of CD.

TI  - Making decisions about chronic disease treatment: a comparison of parents and
      their adolescent children.
PG  - 716-26
LID - 10.1111/hex.12210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare factors considered by parents to those considered by
      adolescents making decisions about chronic disease treatments. METHODS: We
      conducted individual interviews with 15 parent-adolescent dyads in which the
      adolescent had either juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Crohn's disease. Questions
      focused on treatment decisions, with an emphasis on the factors that influenced
      each individual's preferences related to biologic therapies. A multidisciplinary 
      team developed a coding structure. All interviews were coded by two people with
      disagreements resolved through discussion. We used content analysis and coding
      matrices to examine decision factors within and between parent-adolescent dyads. 
      RESULTS: Parents and adolescents both participated in decisions about treatment
      with biologic therapies but considered decision factors differently. In only half
      of cases did parents and adolescents agree on the factor that most influenced
      their decision. Although their decision factors often fell into similar
      categories (e.g. treatment risks, quality of life), in many cases the specifics
      varied between adolescents and their parents. Adolescents were more likely to
      focus on immediate treatment effects and quality of life while parents took a
      longer term view of the decision. Agreement within dyads was most consistent when
      a special circumstance influenced the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS:
      Differences regarding influential decision factors exist within parent-adolescent
      dyads. Continued research is needed to determine the extent to which such
      differences are due to individual preferences or to variations in the information
      available to each person. Future decision support interventions will need to
      address parents' and adolescents' potentially disparate views and information
      needs.

TI  - Pediatric Crohn's disease from onset to adulthood: granulomas are associated with
      an early need for immunomodulation.
PG  - 950-7
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2014.920911 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Childhood onset Crohn's disease (CD) is considered more aggressive
      than adult onset disease. Epithelioid cell granulomas in intestinal biopsies are 
      one, non-obligate, criterion of CD. We investigated granulomas as markers of CD
      severity in children followed to adulthood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five
      individuals with childhood onset CD were studied from diagnosis until attainment 
      of final height, with data on disease location, medical and surgical management
      and with detailed growth data analyses. A blinded review of diagnostic biopsies
      was also performed. RESULTS: We found granulomas in 22/45 (49%) children at
      diagnosis, altogether in 28/45 (62%) patients during the disease course (median
      overall follow-up - 12.3 years, range 9.3-18). Granulomas were found in 9/11
      (82%) with upper gastrointestinal involvement (cumulatively 17/20, 85%) (p =
      0.017 and p = 0.006, respectively). The time from diagnosis to initiating immune 
      modulating treatment (median 4.5 months, range 0-75) was shorter in the
      granuloma-positive group (16/22) compared to the granuloma-negative group (18/23)
      (median 33 months, range 2-105; p = 0.01). The median standard deviation score
      height at diagnosis and final adult height (both adjusted for target height) did 
      not correlate to findings of granulomas. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelioid cell granulomas
      were associated with a shorter time to initiating immune modulating drugs, as a
      possible sign of more severe disease, but growth was not affected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab induces and maintains clinical remission in children with 
      Crohn's disease (CD), but specifically pediatric long-term data remain sparse.
      METHODS: Patients (N = 195) who received infliximab +/- immunomodulator for
      luminal CD were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes included clinical response,
      linear growth, and mucosal healing. Durability of response was assessed using Cox
      proportional hazards models. Levels of infliximab and antibodies (antibodies to
      infliximab) were measured when response was lost. RESULTS: Among 195 patients
      (median age, 13.9 yr; median CD duration, 1.6 yr), 81% experienced complete
      response (judged by physician global assessment and pediatric Crohn's disease
      activity index </=10). Longer duration of diagnosed CD and female gender were
      associated with lower response. During first year of follow-up, 35% of subjects
      had regimen individualized through dose escalation/interval shortening. Despite
      regimen optimization, 16/157 complete responders experienced loss of response at 
      a rate of 2% to 6% per year over 5 years, associated with development of
      antibodies to infliximab. Concurrent immunomodulation for >/=30 weeks
      significantly decreased loss of response (hazard ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence
      interval, 0.08-0.76; P = 0.014). Follow-up endoscopic examination was performed
      in 40 responders, of whom 22 (73%) demonstrated complete resolution of mucosal
      ulceration. Patients with growth potential (Tanner 1/2 at induction) demonstrated
      significant improvements in mean height z-score from induction to years 1 and 2
      of follow-up (P < 0.001). With infliximab initiation within the first 18 months
      after diagnosis, mean height z-score normalized to 0 after 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data demonstrate sustained effectiveness of infliximab in children and
      adolescents with luminal CD. Durability of response is increased by concomitant
      immunomodulation. Clinical response is associated with enhanced linear growth,
      particularly when therapy is initiated early.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effect by exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in a patient with
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA): brief report.
PG  - 1173-5
LID - 10.1007/s10067-014-2672-5 [doi]
AB  - There is extensive evidence for influence of gut microbiota on health. Exclusive 
      enteral nutrition (EEN) possibly changes gut microbiota, but the exact
      pathophysiological role is unknown. EEN has been shown to have an
      anti-inflammatory effect in children with Mb Crohn, an inflammatory bowel
      disease. The intestinal tract is very scarcely studied in children with juvenile 
      idiopathic arthritis (JIA), but data points to an immunologically important role.
      The aim of this study was to explore if EEN had any anti-inflammatory effect in
      children with JIA. The first patient enrolled in the study was followed for 1
      year. She had onset of severe polyarticular disease at 3.2 years of age, negative
      in RF, anti-CCP, ANA, and HLA-B27. She was included in the study at 7.4 years of 
      age. Exclusive enteral nutrition was given in two periods of almost 7 weeks each,
      several months apart, during the year of the study. Clinical and laboratory
      status were assessed before, during, and after treatment periods. In this
      patient, EEN had remarkable anti-inflammatory effect that was sustained for
      months after each of two separate treatment periods. Exclusive enteral nutrition 
      is a possible anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with JIA, but to what
      extent EEN is effective in other children with JIA needs to be explored, as well 
      as the possible pathophysiological role of EEN in those children.

      with inflammatory bowel diseases: a single-center experience.
PG  - 1242-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization trends and health effects of infliximab and adalimumab in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are incompletely understood. We aimed to
      describe utilization trends of these 2 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents,
      determine the correlation between utilization with rates of hospitalization and
      surgery and describe differences in use between adults and children. METHODS:
      Longitudinal data were analyzed for drug utilization, hospitalization, and
      abdominal surgery. Descriptive statistics were used to show trends, and
      utilization quotients were compared for standardization. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis assessed the association between drug use and rates of
      hospitalization and surgery. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-eight pediatric and
      2514 adult patients with IBD generated a total of 51,882 inpatient and outpatient
      encounters, representing 1185 Crohn's disease, 1531 ulcerative colitis, and 236
      indeterminate colitis patients. From 2007 through 2012, utilization quotients
      declined for hospitalization but remained unchanged for surgery; adalimumab saw a
      3-fold increase, despite continued dominance of infliximab. Median band and mean 
      fitted plots showed downward hospitalization trends from 2006 to 2012.
      Utilization of infliximab peaked in 2008, Q4 with gradual decline to 2012, Q2;
      and adalimumab showed moderate increased utilization since 2007, Q1. Use of
      infliximab (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.83) and
      adalimumab (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.87) was associated with decreased
      hospitalization risk but not associated with reduced abdominal surgery risk.
      Children had increased hospitalization (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.49-2.88) but
      decreased risk for abdominal surgery (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current infliximab use remains substantially greater than adalimumab use, despite
      recent increased use of adalimumab. Although trends for hospitalization for IBD
      are decreasing, it is not reflected in abdominal surgery rates in a tertiary IBD 
      referral center.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has changed
      dramatically in recent years with a wider use of immunomodulators and the
      introduction of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. This article reviews
      the existing data on the long-term efficacy of biologics, that is, anti-TNF
      agents, for preventing complications and surgery in patients with IBD. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Anti-TNF agents are effective for preventing endoscopic and surgical
      recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease. They are able to achieve fistula
      closure and do not increase the risk of stricture. Most randomized short-term
      trials also showed decreased requirement for hospitalizations and surgery in
      patients receiving anti-TNF. However, observational studies from referral centers
      or based on population have shown conflicting results. The need for surgery in
      Crohn's disease and the risk of colectomy in ulcerative colitis seem to be
      decreasing in recent years, but the specific effect of the introduction of
      anti-TNF agents cannot be currently evaluated. SUMMARY: Although anti-TNF agents 
      are the most powerful drugs in IBD, their ability to decrease the need for
      surgery remains unclear. Conflicting results observed in observational surveys
      might be because of anti-TNF agents administered too late in the course of IBD.

TI  - Faecal metabolite profiling identifies medium-chain fatty acids as discriminating
      compounds in IBD.
PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms module: feasibility, reliability, and validity.
PG  - 347-55
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the measurement
      properties of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for
      patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages
      between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL 
      Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682
      parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic
      constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease).
      RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood,
      diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales
      evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores
      (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and
      good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report
      alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with
      the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales 
      known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor
      analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS:
      The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement
      properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in
      clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs
      and organic GI diseases.

TI  - Autologous stem cell transplantation in severe treatment-resistant Crohn's
      disease: long-term follow-up of UK patients treated on compassionate basis.
PG  - 871-7
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcu095 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may achieve
      disease control in severe treatment-resistant Crohn's disease (CD), relapse is
      frequent, and there is little information regarding long-term outcomes in terms
      of response to subsequent treatments and complications of ASCT. DESIGN:
      Retrospective evaluation of UK patients treated on a compassionate basis from
      three UK tertiary centres. METHODS: We summarize long-term outcomes of six
      previously unreported patients with severe treatment-resistant CD treated with
      ASCT according to international guidelines between 2003 and 2009. Median duration
      of CD before ASCT was 14 (7-22) years. Following stem cell mobilization, patients
      were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and rabbit
      anti-thymocyte globulin (7.5 mg/kg) followed by ASCT. RESULTS: All patients
      tolerated ASCT with routine toxicities and no treatment-related mortality and are
      alive at 50-123 months post-ASCT. Clinical and endoscopic remissions of CD were
      confirmed at 3 months post-ASCT in five patients, although median time to next
      treatment for inflammatory disease was 10 months (range: 3-16 months).
      Subsequently, disease control was achieved with previously ineffective and newer 
      treatments, with surgery performed predominantly for pre-existing fibrotic
      strictures. Two patients became independent of home total parenteral nutrition
      (TPN). Reported late complications of ASCT included hypothyroidism and ovarian
      failure. CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up supports the safety and feasibility of
      ASCT as a means of achieving short-term control of severe CD whilst potentially
      re-sensitizing the disease to medical therapy and reducing requirements for
      surgery and TPN. Given the inevitability of relapse, pre-emptive salvage and/or
      maintenance treatments post-ASCT should be the focus of future trials.

TI  - The prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection in pediatric and adult patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2222-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3169-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high prevalence
      of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI in children with IBD may differ
      from adults. We aim to compare the prevalence of CDI in hospitalized pediatric
      and adult IBD patients and patients without IBD. METHODS: The rates of CDI per
      1,000 IBD and non-IBD hospitalizations between 1993 and 2012 were examined using 
      the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database. Age, sex and
      calendar year adjusted incidence rate ratios comparing CDI in pediatrics and
      adults by type of IBD and with patients without IBD were calculated. p values for
      trend identifying changes in rates over time were calculated. RESULTS: Among
      children, the rate of CDI was over 12 times greater in IBD than non-IBD
      hospitalizations (p < 0.0001) and among adults, the rate of CDI was four times
      greater in IBD than non-IBD hospitalizations (p < 0.0001). In adults, CDI was
      significantly higher in ulcerative colitis (UC) than Crohn's disease (60.4 per
      1,000 vs. 19.8 per 1,000, p < 0.0001) but in children there was no difference in 
      CDI in UC compared with Crohn's disease (32 per 1,000 vs. 27 per 1,000, p =
      0.45). The prevalence of CDI increased in pediatric and adult IBD patients, and
      patients without IBD, between 1993 and 2012 (p for trend <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
      CDI was more common in adult patients with UC, and no difference was found
      between CDI and IBD type in pediatrics. There may be different risk factors for
      CDI during hospitalization between adults and children with IBD.

TI  - Utility of neutrophil Fcgamma receptor I (CD64) index as a biomarker for mucosal 
      inflammation in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1037-48
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neutrophil expression of the Fcgamma receptor I (CD64) is upregulated
      in adult patients with clinically active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We
      tested the relationship of CD64 with mucosal inflammation and clinical relapse in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: In a cohort of 208 newly diagnosed CD
      and 43 non-IBD controls, ileal expression of FcgammaRI/S100A9 was determined by
      RNA sequencing from biopsies obtained at ileocolonoscopy. In a second cohort, we 
      tested for the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) CD64 index
      from 26 newly diagnosed CD, 30 non-IBD controls, and 83 children with established
      CD. RESULTS: Ileal FcgammaRIA mRNA expression was significantly elevated in CD at
      diagnosis compared with non-IBD controls (P < 0.001), and correlated with ileal
      S100A9 (calprotectin) expression (r = 0.83, P < 0.001). The median (range) PMN
      CD64 index for newly diagnosed CD was 2.3 (0.74-9.3) compared with 0.76
      (0.39-1.2) for non-IBD controls (P < 0.001) with 96% sensitivity and 90%
      specificity at the cut point of 1.0. The PMN CD64 index significantly correlated 
      with mucosal injury as measured by the simple endoscopic score for CD (r = 0.62, 
      P < 0.001). Patients with CD in clinical remission receiving maintenance therapy 
      with a PMN CD64 index <1.0 had a sustained remission rate of 95% over the
      following 12 months compared with 56% in those with a PMN CD64 index >1.0 (P <
      0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An elevated PMN CD64 index is associated with both mucosal
      inflammation and an increased risk for clinical relapse in pediatric CD. The PMN 
      CD64 index is a reliable marker for sustained remission in patients with CD
      receiving maintenance therapy.

TI  - Repeated exclusive enteral nutrition in the treatment of paediatric Crohn's
      disease: predictors of efficacy and outcome.
PG  - 1398-407
LID - 10.1111/apt.12770 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) induces remission and mucosal
      healing in children with active Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To compare short- and 
      long-term outcomes of the first vs. second courses of EEN, and to identify
      predictors of sustained remission. METHODS: Retrospective single centre analysis 
      of all patients with CD (6-18 years) treated with EEN over 7.5 years. Patients
      were excluded if exposed to anti-TNFalpha or corticosteroids 3 months prior to
      EEN. Data included disease phenotype, activity, NOD2 genotype, laboratory indices
      and anthropometrics. Remission and relapse were defined by mathematically
      weighted Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) with 1-year
      follow-up. RESULTS: Of 94 patients treated with EEN, 52 fulfilled inclusion
      criteria (31 male, mean age 13.2 years). Azathioprine was started within the
      first month in 33/52 patients; 26/52 received a second EEN course. First compared
      to second EEN revealed higher wPCDAI at start (59 vs. 40, P < 0.0001), tended to 
      higher remission rates after 3 months (92% vs. 77%, n.s.), but showed comparable 
      1-year relapse rates (67% vs. 70%, median time 231 vs. 145 days, n.s.). Disease
      activity, weight gain and inflammatory markers showed better improvement with
      first EEN. Faecal calprotectin >200 mug/g during EEN was associated with shorter 
      remission (median time 157 vs. 287 days, n.s.). Certain NOD2 genotypes were
      related to higher relapse rates (92% R702W or G908R vs. 50% 1007fs vs. 60%
      wild-type, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition induces remission 
      in active Crohn's disease, but efficacy tends to decrease with the second course.
      Despite early azathioprine use, 1-year relapse rates are high, but may be related
      to NOD2 genotype.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health administrative databases can be used to track disease
      incidence, outcomes, and care quality. Case validation is necessary to ensure
      accurate disease ascertainment using these databases. In this study, we aimed to 
      validate adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) identification algorithms. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used two large cohorts of incident patients from
      Ontario, Canada to validate algorithms. We linked information extracted from
      charts to health administrative data and compared the accuracy of various
      algorithms. In addition, we validated an algorithm to distinguish patients with
      Crohn's from those with ulcerative colitis and assessed the adequate look-back
      period to distinguish incident from prevalent cases. RESULTS: Over 5,000
      algorithms were tested. The most accurate algorithm to identify patients 18 to 64
      years at diagnosis was five physician contacts or hospitalizations within 4 years
      (sensitivity, 76.8%; specificity, 96.2%; positive predictive value (PPV), 81.4%; 
      negative predictive value (NPV), 95.0%). In patients >/=65 years at diagnosis,
      adding a pharmacy claim for an IBD-related medication improved accuracy.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with adult-onset incident IBD can be accurately identified
      from within health administrative data. The validated algorithms will be applied 
      to administrative data to expand the Ontario Crohn's and Colitis Cohort to all
      patients with IBD in the province of Ontario.

TI  - Provider awareness alone does not improve transition readiness skills in
      adolescent patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 221-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000405 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adolescent patients with chronic health conditions must gradually
      assume responsibility for their health. Self-management skills are needed for a
      successful transfer from adolescent to adult health care, but the development of 
      these skills could be resource intensive. Pediatric providers are already
      instrumental in teaching patients about their health and may improve these
      skills. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether informal education of
      pediatric providers regarding transition improves inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patient self-management skills. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBD
      older than 10 years who presented to the outpatient setting were administered a
      survey regarding self-management behaviors in 2008 and 2011. During this time,
      several conferences on transition were presented to the providers. RESULTS: In
      2008, 294 patients completed the survey (82%) compared with 121 patients (89%) in
      2011. The patient groups were comparable with respect to sex (boys 50% vs 42%),
      mean age (16.7 vs 16.2 years), and type of IBD (Crohn 68% vs 66%). The 13- to
      15-year-olds reported calling in refills (11%, 8%, respectively), scheduling
      clinic appointment (0, 1%), preparing questions (13%, 5%), and taking the main
      role in talking during clinic visits (15%, 24%). The 16- to 18-year-olds reported
      calling in refills (13%, 27%), scheduling clinic appointments (9%, 6%), preparing
      questions (9%, 16%), and taking the main role in talking in clinic visits (36%,
      45%). Responsibility for behaviors gradually increases with age, but did not
      differ significantly between 2008 and 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing awareness
      around transition readiness for pediatric providers had an insignificant effect
      on the self-management skills of patients with IBD. A more formal or structured
      approach is likely required to improve transition skills in adolescent patients.

AB  - Although vitamin K deficiency has been implicated in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), its prevalence in pediatric IBD remains unknown. We carried out a 
      cross-sectional study in 63 children with Crohn's disease (CD) and 48 with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) to assess the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency and to
      search for potential correlation between vitamin K status and pediatric IBD
      activity. Vitamin K status was assessed using protein induced by vitamin K
      absence-II (PIVKA-II; ELISA). Prevalence of vitamin K deficiency was 54.0% in CD 
      and 43.7% in UC. Vitamin K deficiency was more common in patients with higher CD 
      activity, in CD patients with higher mass Z-scores, and less common among
      children with CD treated with infliximab. Relation of vitamin K deficiency to
      pediatric IBD clinical course and treatment demand further research.

TI  - Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC22A23 are associated with ulcerative
      colitis in a Canadian white cohort.
PG  - 289-94
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.080549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane
      transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently
      nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association
      study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with
      diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in
      the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly
      monitored, Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23
      were associated with intestinal inflammation. DESIGN: Selected genetic variations
      were genotyped by using fluorescent-based assays or a polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 160 individuals
      with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative colitis, and 142 healthy
      control subjects to determine genetic associations. RESULTS: Homozygocity for
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and rs950318-GG was associated with 
      IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases) carried these genotypes, but they
      were not seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this
      article add to the emerging evidence that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD
      risk. However, the biology of the gene and impact of variations on the gene's
      functions need to be tested to validate a causative role.

AB  - The fourth scientific workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization
      (ECCO) focused on the relevance of intestinal fibrosis in the disease course of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective was to better understand the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis, to identify useful markers 
      and imaging modalities of fibrosis in order to assess its presence and
      progression, and, finally, to point out possible approaches for the prevention
      and the treatment of fibrosis. The results of this workshop are presented in
      three separate manuscripts. This first section describes the most important
      mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of intestinal
      fibrosis in IBD including the cellular and molecular mediators, the extracellular
      matrix molecules and matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitors of
      metalloproteinases-system, the microbiota products, the role of fat, genetic and 
      epigenetic factors, as well as the currently available experimental models.
      Furthermore, it identifies unanswered questions in the field of intestinal
      fibrosis and provides a framework for future research.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been to be more effective
      than corticosteroids in achieving mucosal healing without their side effects.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of EEN in terms of inducing clinical
      remission in newly diagnosed CD children and to study the efficacy of this
      therapeutic approach in improving the degree of intestinal mucosa inflammation.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with newly diagnosed
      Crohn's disease treated with EEN were reviewed retrospectively. The degree of
      mucosal inflammation was assessed by fecal calprotectin (FC). Remission was
      defined as a PCDAI<10. RESULTS: Forty patients (24 males) were included, the age 
      at diagnosis was 11.6 +/- 3.6 years. Of the 34 patients who completed the EEN
      period, 32 (94% per-protocol analysis) achieved clinical remission. This
      percentage fell to 80% in the intention-to-treat analysis. The compliance rate
      was 95%. Duration of EEN was 6.42 weeks (IQR 6.0-8.14). FC was significantly
      higher in patients with moderate and severe disease. Median baseline FC levels
      (680 mug/g) decreased significantly to 218 mug/g (P<0.0001) after EEN. We found a
      statistically significant correlation between FC and PCDAI (rho=0.727; P<0.0001).
      Early use of thiopurines (< 8 weeks) versus subsequent use was not associated
      with improved outcomes during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: EEN administered for
      6-8 weeks is effective for inducing clinical remission and decreasing the degree 
      of mucosal inflammation. We did not find differences in terms of maintenance of
      remission in patients treated early with thiopurines.

AB  - Growth and nutritional status are important issues in paediatric inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). While linear growth is easy to assess, nutritional status is
      more complicated, with reports often compromised by the use of simple measures,
      such as weight and the body mass index, to assess nutritional status rather than 
      more appropriate and sophisticated techniques to measure body composition. This
      review is an update on what is currently known about nutritional status as
      determined by body composition in paediatric IBD. Further, this review will focus
      on the impact of biologics on growth in paediatric IBD. Significant lean mass
      deficits have been reported in children with IBD compared with controls, and
      there is evidence these deficits persist over time. Furthermore, data imply that 
      gender differences exist in body composition, both at diagnosis and in response
      to treatment. With respect to growth improvements following treatment with
      biologics, there are conflicting data. While some studies report enhancement of
      growth, others do not. The relationship between disease severity, impaired growth
      and the requirement for biologics needs to be considered when interpreting these 
      data. However, key features associated with improvements in growth appear to be
      successful clinical response to treatment, patients in early stages of puberty,
      and the presence of growth failure at the onset of treatment.

PG  - 3153-63
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i12.3153 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease in particular, is a common cause
      of intestinal failure. Current therapeutic options include home parenteral
      nutrition and intestinal transplantation. For most patients, home intravenous
      therapy including parenteral nutrition, with a good probability of long-term
      survival, is the favoured choice. However, in selected patients, with specific
      features that may shorten survival or complicate home parenteral nutrition,
      intestinal transplantation presents a viable alternative. We present survival,
      complications, quality of life and economic considerations that currently
      influence individualised decision-making between home parenteral nutrition and
      intestinal transplantation.

TI  - Epithelial transport in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 1099-109
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000029 [doi]
AB  - The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most versatile tissues
      in the organism, responsible for providing a tight barrier between dietary and
      bacterial antigens and the mucosal and systemic immune system while maintaining
      efficient digestive and absorptive processes to ensure adequate nutrient and
      energy supply. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis) are associated with a breakdown of both functions, which in some cases
      are clearly interrelated. In this updated literature review, we focus on the
      effects of intestinal inflammation and the associated immune mediators on
      selected aspects of the transepithelial transport of macronutrients and
      micronutrients. The mechanisms responsible for nutritional deficiencies are not
      always clear and could be related to decreased intake, malabsorption, and excess 
      losses. We summarize the known causes of nutrient deficiencies and the mechanism 
      of inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. We also overview the
      consequences of impaired epithelial transport, which infrequently transcend its
      primary purpose to affect the gut microbial ecology and epithelial integrity.
      Although some of those regulatory mechanisms are relatively well established,
      more work needs to be done to determine how inflammatory cytokines can alter the 
      transport process of nutrients across the gastrointestinal and renal epithelia.

TI  - National Trends and In-Hospital Outcomes of Adult Patients With Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Receiving Parenteral Nutrition Support.
PG  - 412-6
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie
      malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased
      metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies 
      of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to
      determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide
      Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among
      patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A
      multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased
      inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual
      incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and 
      among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable
      through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients
      with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors
      predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50
      years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile
      colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism,
      malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally,
      patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients
      with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a
      longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with 
      CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with
      UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) may involve any part of the gastrointestinal
      tract. We assessed the prevalence and features of upper gastrointestinal (UGI)
      lesions in CD. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included 138 CD
      patients that underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The rate of Crohn's
      specific endoscopic lesions in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was assessed,
      and immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Changes in the UGI lesions were
      assessed in those who had two or more EGD. RESULTS: Of 138 patients, 51.3% had
      Crohn's specific UGI lesions. The rates of Crohn's specific lesion in the
      esophagus, upper-to-middle stomach, lower stomach, duodenal bulb, and 2nd portion
      of the duodenum were 6.5%, 47.8%, 24.6%, 31.9%, and 18.1%, respectively.
      Granulomas were detected in 6.1%, 25.0%, and 11.4% in the upper-to-middle
      stomach, lower stomach, and duodenal bulb, respectively, but none in the
      esophagus and 2nd portion of the duodenum. Thirty-seven were analyzed for
      Helicobacter pylori and 4 were positive (10.8%). Improvements of UGI lesions were
      seen in 14 out of 49 (28.5%) and were unchanged in 59.2% and worsened in 12.2%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Crohn's specific UGI lesions was common in our
      case series, and immunohistochemical studies suggested that the majority was
      unrelated to Helicobacter pylori infection. Worsening of UGI lesions over the
      course was rare.

TI  - Impact of Disease Activity on Resting Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in 
      Adult Crohn's Disease: A Prospective Longitudinal Assessment.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during 
      phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been
      reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our
      aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy
      expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. 
      REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score,
      C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed.
      RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had
      increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 
      5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not
      sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active
      disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body 
      composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared 
      with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and
      behavior.

      infection or malignancy develops.
PG  - 926-35
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000002 [doi]
AB  - Thiopurines and biologics are being used earlier and more frequently for the
      treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These medications are
      generally well tolerated and usually do not require cessation due to a side
      effect. Rare but serious infections and cancers may develop in patients on these 
      immunosuppressants. Evidence-based data are lacking to guide physicians on
      whether continuing or stopping thiopurines and biologics is necessary and, when a
      side effect does occur, if and when restarting these medications is feasible. The
      aim of this review was to outline the infectious and malignant complications that
      may develop on these treatments and to provide recommendations for continuing,
      stopping, and restarting thiopurines and biologics once a patient develops a
      treatment-related complication. These are not formal guidelines and should not
      replace individualized care by the treating physician.

TI  - Decline in presumptively protective gut bacterial species and metabolites are
      paradoxically associated with disease improvement in pediatric Crohn's disease
      during enteral nutrition.
PG  - 861-71
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a successful treatment, but
      its mode of action remains unknown. This study assessed serial changes in the
      fecal microbiota milieu during EEN. METHODS: Five fecal samples were collected
      from CD children: 4 during EEN (start, 15, 30, end EEN approximately 60 days) and
      the fifth on habitual diet. Two samples were collected from healthy control
      subjects. Fecal pH, bacterial metabolites, global microbial diversity abundance, 
      composition stability, and quantitative changes of total and 7 major bacterial
      groups previously implicated in CD were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 68 samples
      were from 15 CD children and 40 from 21 control subjects. Fecal pH and total
      sulfide increased and butyric acid decreased during EEN (all P < 0.05). Global
      bacterial diversity abundance decreased (P < 0.05); a higher degree of microbiota
      composition stability was seen in control subjects than in CD children during EEN
      (at P </= 0.008). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp concentration significantly
      decreased after 30 days on EEN (P < 0.05). In patients who responded to EEN, the 
      magnitude of the observed changes was greater and the concentration of
      Bacteroides/Prevotella group decreased (P < 0.05). All these changes reverted to 
      pretreatment levels on free diet, and EEN microbiota diversity increased when the
      children returned to their free diet. CONCLUSIONS: EEN impacts on gut microbiota 
      composition and changes fecal metabolic activity. It is difficult to infer a
      causative association between such changes and disease improvement, but the
      results do challenge the current perception of a protective role for F.
      prausnitzii in CD.

TI  - A retrospective study showing maintenance treatment options for paediatric CD in 
      the first year following diagnosis after induction of remission with EEN:
      supplemental enteral nutrition is better than nothing!
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-14-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A limited body of research suggests that ongoing maintenance enteral 
      nutrition (MEN) can be beneficial in maintaining disease remission in Crohn's
      Disease (CD). We aimed to assess how achievable MEN is and whether it helps to
      prolong remission. METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2010 and 2011 who
      commenced exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for 8 weeks were followed up for a
      year post diagnosis. All patients who took EEN were encouraged to continue MEN
      post EEN. Data on azathioprine use was also collected. Categorical variables were
      compared using chi-square/Fischer's exact test. Medians were expressed along with
      complete data ranges. RESULTS: 59 patients (34 male, median age 11.07 years,
      range 2.5-16.33 years) were identified. 11/59 (18%) had a poor response to EEN
      and were switched to steroids. 48/59 patients completed 8 weeks EEN and achieved 
      clinical remission/response. 46/48 patients received Modulen IBD(R), 29/48 (60%) 
      consumed EEN orally and 19/48 (40%) via NGT. 15/48 (31%) patients were able to
      continue MEN post EEN completion. MEN was consumed for a mean of 10.8 months
      (range 4-14 months). 14/15 patients drank MEN and 1/15 had MEN via NGT. Remission
      rates at 1 year in patients continuing MEN were 60% (9/15) compared to 15% (2/13)
      in patients taking no treatment (p = 0.001) and 65% (13/20) in patients taking
      azathioprine (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION: A sub group of patients can continue MEN as 
      a maintenance treatment and this seems a useful strategy, especially in those who
      are not commencing azathioprine.

AB  - The chronic intestinal inflammation that characterises Crohn's disease and

      immune system, and the intestinal microbiota. In addition, environmental factors

      are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, and smoking is associated with
      recurrence after surgery and a poor response to medical therapy. Conversely,
      smoking appears protective against ulcerative colitis and smokers are less likely
      to require colectomy. The mechanism by which smoking exerts its impact on disease
      and the rational for the dichotomous effect in patients with Crohn's disease and 
      ulcerative colitis is not clear. Recent evidence suggests that smoking induces
      alterations to both the innate and acquired immune system. In addition, smoking
      is associated with a distinct alteration in the intestinal microbiota both in
      patients with active Crohn's disease and healthy subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) are the key treatments for
      Crohn's Disease (CD), unresponsive to standard treatments. Our aim was to compare
      the efficacy and safety of IFX and ADA in treating CD in clinical practice.
      METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients (61 M, 65 F, mean age 36.2 years,
      range 19-67 years), affected by CD, were treated with infliximab (IFX, 59
      patients) or adalimumab (ADA, 66 patients). Clinical efficacy, mucosal healing
      (MH), histological healing (HH), and safety were assessed. MH was defined
      complicated if healing of ulcers occurred with deformation of bowel profile
      and/or complete colonoscopy was impossible because of scars. RESULTS: Patients
      were followed-up for 36 months. No difference was found between IFX and ADA in
      maintaining long-term clinical remission, MH and HH. Complicated MH was present
      in 17 (28.8%) patients in IFX group and in 7 (10.6%) patients in ADA group
      (p=0.012). In 9 (15.2%) patients in IFX group and 2 (3.0%) patients in ADA group 
      colonoscopy was incomplete without cecal intubation or terminal ileum exploration
      (p=0.024). Side effects were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both IFX and
      ADA seem to be effective and safe in long-term outpatient treatment of CD in
      clinical practice.

TI  - The treatment-naive microbiome in new-onset Crohn's disease.
PG  - 382-392
LID - 10.1016/j.chom.2014.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), are
      genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role for
      aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However, patterns of gut
      microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies.
      Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal locations collected prior to
      treatment in new-onset cases, we studied the microbiome in the largest pediatric 
      CD cohort to date. An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which
      include Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and
      Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales,
      and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison
      between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that
      antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing
      the microbial signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples
      indicates that at this early stage of disease, assessing the rectal
      mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for convenient and early
      diagnosis of CD.

TI  - Predictors of response to enteral nutrition in abdominal enterocutaneous fistula 
      patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 959-63
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is a serious complication of
      Crohn's disease (CD). Enteral nutrition (EN) is believed as one of therapeutic
      strategies of CD. This study is dedicated to identify predictors of response to
      EN in CD, which may lead to a better selection of fistula patients for this
      therapy. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty-eight CD patients with ECF treated with
      short-peptide-based EN for 3 months were included in this study. All patients
      were followed up for at least 6 months. Logistic regression was performed to
      investigate the potential predictors of response to EN in these patients.
      RESULTS: In total, 30 out of 48 patients were confirmed with a successful closure
      of fistula after 3 months' EN therapy. The average closure time was 32.4+/-8.85
      days. Inflammatory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein
      (CRP) and platelet count) improved significantly after EN therapy in all enrolled
      patients. Specifically, the improvement of CRP after therapy in closed group was 
      more important compared with that in unclosed group (P=0.035). Nutrition status
      (body weight, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin, serum albumin (ALB), serum
      prealbumin and total protein (TP)) improved as well (P<0.05). Similarly, after
      treatment, the improvement of serum albumin (P=0.046) and prealbumin (P=0.006) in
      closed group was much more important than those in unclosed group. Logistic
      regression analysis discovered that a decreased CRP level and an elevated BMI
      level would be beneficial to the response to EN in CD patients with ECF.
      CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients with ECF, lower CRP and higher BMI are associated
      with higher possibility of closure after EN treatment. EN therapy can lead to a
      closure of ECF in a certain proportion of patients. EN therapy could also
      ameliorate inflammatory condition and improve nutrition status.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Seasonal and geographic variations of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) exacerbations have been described in adults, with inconsistent findings. We
      sought to determine whether disease activity in pediatric-onset IBD is associated
      with a seasonal pattern. METHODS: We examined children with Crohn disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) using data from the ImproveCareNow Collaborative
      between December 2008 and November 2010. We compared the proportion of patients
      in continuous remission for all recorded visits in each season. We also compared 
      the distribution of all recorded visits with a physician global assessment (PGA) 
      of remission or active disease across seasons. RESULTS: A total of 1325 patients 
      with CD (6102 visits) and 587 patients with UC (2394 visits) were included. The
      proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission during each season was
      highest in the summer (67%) and lowest in the winter (55%) (P=0.01). A similar
      pattern was found for CD but was not significant. Similarly, the proportion of
      visits in remission was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter for both
      UC (29%, 21%; P<0.001) and CD (28%, 23%; P<0.001); however, the distribution of
      visits with active disease was not significantly different across seasons.
      CONCLUSIONS: The higher proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission in
      the summer may be related to the higher proportion of remission visits in the
      summer, because the proportion of visits with active disease was similar across
      seasons. These findings do not support any strong associations between season of 
      the year and disease activity in pediatric IBD.

      remission and subsequent exacerbation.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0090981 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited studies have examined the intestinal microbiota composition
      in relation to changes in disease course of IBD over time. We aimed to study
      prospectively the fecal microbiota in IBD patients developing an exacerbation
      during follow-up. DESIGN: Fecal samples from 10 Crohn's disease (CD) and 9
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation
      were included. Active disease was determined by colonoscopy and/or fecal
      calprotectine levels. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, antibiotic use, enema
      use and/or medication changes between consecutive samples. The microbial
      composition was assessed by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS: After quality
      control, 6,194-11,030 sequences per sample were available for analysis.
      Patient-specific shifts in bacterial composition and diversity were observed
      during exacerbation compared to remission, but overarching shifts within UC or CD
      were not observed. Changes in the bacterial community composition between
      remission and exacerbation as assessed by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, were
      significantly larger in CD versus UC patients (0.59 vs. 0.42, respectively; p =
      0.025). Thiopurine use was found to be a significant cause of clustering as shown
      by Principal Coordinate Analysis and was associated with decreases in bacterial
      richness (Choa1 501.2 vs. 847.6 in non-users; p<0.001) and diversity (Shannon
      index: 5.13 vs. 6.78, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Shifts in microbial
      composition in IBD patients with changing disease activity over time seem to be
      patient-specific, and are more pronounced in CD than in UC patients. Furthermore,
      thiopurine use was found to be associated with the microbial composition and
      diversity, and should be considered when studying the intestinal microbiota in
      relation to disease course.

TI  - Development of a self-efficacy scale for adolescents and young adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 29-32
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well 
      within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is
      self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks.
      Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and
      could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric
      IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a
      self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD.
      METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food
      and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome
      measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using
      qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an
      outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured
      interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes
      related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of
      gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed
      items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of
      participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods.
      The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5
      parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites,
      74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years 
      (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4
      theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD,
      managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item
      disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess
      self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate
      this newly designed scale are presently under way.

TI  - Colonic expression of the peptide transporter PEPT1 is downregulated during
      intestinal inflammation and is not required for NOD2-dependent immune activation.
PG  - 671-84
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000443336.71488.08 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues
      in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by
      transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate
      intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and
      oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this
      transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and
      studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental
      colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate
      sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced
      cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was 
      characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis
      (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of
      patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the
      PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with
      IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently 
      reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type 
      and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and
      MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels
      were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute
      inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated
      with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is
      reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for
      MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide
      polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data 
      strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression
      of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-onset (EO) pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) seem to 
      be more extensive than those with a later onset. To test this hypothesis, we
      examined the phenotype and disease course of patients with IBD diagnosis at 0 to 
      5 years, compared with the ranges 6 to 11 and 12 to 18 years. METHODS: Anatomic
      locations and behaviors were assessed according to Paris classification in 506
      consecutive patients: 224 Crohn's disease, 245 ulcerative colitis, and 37
      IBD-unclassified. RESULTS: Eleven percent of patients were in the range 0 to 5
      years, 39% in 6 to 11 years, and 50% in 12 to 18 years. Ulcerative colitis was
      the most frequent diagnosis in EO-IBD and in 6- to 11-year-old group, whereas
      Crohn's disease was predominant in older children. A classification as
      IBD-unclassified was more common in the range 0 to 5 years compared with the
      other groups (P < 0.005). EO Crohn's disease showed a more frequent isolated
      colonic (P < 0.005) and upper gastrointestinal involvement than later-onset
      disease. Sixty-two percent of the patients in the 0 to 5 years range had
      pancolonic ulcerative colitis, compared with 38% of 6 to 11 years (P = 0.02) and 
      31% of 12-18 years (P = 0.002) range. No statistical difference for family
      history for IBD was found in the 3-year age groups. Therapies at the diagnosis
      were similar for all children. However, at latest follow-up, a significantly
      higher proportion of younger children were under steroids compared with older
      groups (P < 0.05). Surgical risk did not differ according to age. CONCLUSIONS:
      EO-IBD exhibits an extensive phenotype and benefit from aggressive treatment
      strategies, although surgical risk is similar to later-onset disease. A family
      history for IBD is not common in EO disease.

TI  - PRESENT; PREScription of Enteral Nutrition in pediaTric Crohn's disease in Spain.
PG  - 537-46
LID - 10.3305/nh.2014.29.3.7184 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one of the therapeutic
      strategies used to induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Although
      its use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents,
      the frequency of this practice in Spain is unknown. METHODS: A 70-item
      questionnaire ( PRESENT: PREScription of Enteral Nutrition in pediaTric Crohn's
      disease in Spain) was drafted and distributed through the SEGHNP (Spanish Society
      for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) e-mail list. RESULTS:
      We received information from 51 Pediatric Gastroenterology Units. Of the 287
      patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2011-2012 at these centres (139 in 2011, 148 
      in 2012), 182 (63%) received EEN (58% in 2011 and 68% in 2012). 26% of the
      patients who received EEN in the period studied (64/246) did so during relapses. 
      All the physicians (100%) who responded to the questionnaire believe that EEN is 
      effective in inducing clinical remission in mild to moderate CD. However, 24.5%
      of respondents never use EEN during relapses. The enteral formulas used most
      often used were polymeric formulas specific for CD (70.6%) and the preferred
      administration route was oral, with 60.8% using flavouring and 9.3% allowing a
      variable percentage of calories in the form of other foods. 65% use 5-ASA
      together with EEN, 69% use antibiotics and 95% immunomodulators (thiopurines).
      The duration of EEN tends to be 8 weeks (47.1%), and transition to regular diet
      was achieved sequentially over a variable period of time. Regarding barriers and 
      limiting factors for the use of EEN, those most frequently reported include lack 
      of acceptance by the patient and/or family (71%), lack of time and/or ancillary
      staff (69%) and difficulty in convincing the patient and/or family of the
      suitability of treatment (43%). CONCLUSIONS: EEN use rates are similar to those
      of other European questionnaires. Tools that facilitate acceptance by the patient
      and family are needed. Increasing the time dedicated to this therapeutic modality
      is likewise important. Given the disparity of criteria for indicating treatment
      with EEN, it would be useful to have widely accepted clinical practice guidelines
      or protocols that facilitate the decision to use it.

TI  - Preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition reduces the postoperative septic
      complications of fistulizing Crohn's disease.
PG  - 441-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been shown to be
      effective in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). However, few experiences
      have been reported regarding its role in postoperative intra-abdominal septic
      complications (IASCs) after bowel resections for enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs).
      Our aim was to investigate the influence of preoperative 3-month EEN on the
      incidence of IASCs and to clarify the risk factors of IASCs in fistulizing CD.
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective study on 123 CD patients suffering from ECFs
      was conducted from February 2001 to April 2011. Fifty-five patients (44.7%)
      received preoperative 3-month EEN. The changes in serum albumin and C-reactive
      protein (CRP) were compared. Perioperative data were analyzed using logistic
      regression to identify the independent risk factors affecting the incidence of
      postoperative IASCs. RESULTS: Patients were similar in gender, age, fistula
      conditions and perioperative medications in the EEN and non-EEN groups. The EEN
      group had a significantly higher serum albumin level and lower CRP at operation, 
      and suffered a lower risk of IASCs (3.6% vs 17.6%, P<0.05). Two years after
      operation when follow-up ended, the two groups had comparable cumulative risk of 
      IASCs (P=0.109). A logistic regression analysis identified age at operation and
      preoperative EEN as independent risk factors of postoperative IASCs. CONCLUSIONS:
      Preoperative EEN reduced the risk of postoperative IASCs after operation for ECFs
      in CD. In addition, age at operation may be another factor of influence.

TI  - Depressive symptoms in youth with inflammatory bowel disease compared with a
      community sample.
PG  - 614-21
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000442678.62674.b7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have produced mixed findings on whether youth
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience elevated rates of depressive
      symptoms. Our first aim was to compare self-report of depressive symptoms by
      youth with IBD with a community sample. The second aim was to examine the
      relationship between symptoms of depression and measures of disease activity.
      METHODS: Item-level responses on the Children's Depression Inventory among a
      sample of 78 youth diagnosed with IBD were compared with responses from a
      community sample using 1-sample t-tests. Particular attention was given to items 
      assessing somatic symptoms of depression given the potential overlap with IBD
      disease symptoms. The relationship between depressive symptoms and IBD disease
      activity was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and linear 
      regression. RESULTS: Youth with IBD reported lower levels of depressive symptoms 
      compared with the community sample on the Children's Depression Inventory Total
      Score, and similar or lower levels of difficulty on items assessing somatic
      symptoms. Most of the sample had inactive or mild disease activity at the time of
      participation, with 14% experiencing moderate/severe disease activity. Higher
      ratings of disease activity were related to greater depressive symptoms.
      Responses on somatic items from the Children's Depression Inventory were not
      differentially related to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: As a group, pediatric
      patients with IBD did not experience the clinical levels of depressive symptoms
      or elevations in depressive symptoms when compared with a community sample.
      Somatic symptoms of depression do not differentiate youth with IBD experiencing
      elevations in disease activity from youth experiencing nonsomatic symptoms of
      depression.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influenza vaccination status among
      paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Poland. This was a
      questionnaire-based study. 242 patients with IBD and 142 controls were enrolled
      in the study. Of patients with IBD, 7.8% received an influenza vaccine, compared 
      to 18.3% of controls (P = 0.0013). There were no statistically significant
      differences in time from IBD diagnosis, disease activity and in drugs, between
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated IBD children. In conclusion, the data of our study 
      demonstrate an alarmingly poor influenza vaccination status in the majority of
      children with IBD. Therefore, there is an unmet need to implement better
      influenza vaccination strategies for this group of patients.

TI  - Postinduction serum infliximab trough level and decrease of C-reactive protein
      level are associated with durable sustained response to infliximab: a
      retrospective analysis of the ACCENT I trial.
PG  - 1721-7
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-304094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum infliximab trough levels correlate with efficacy; dose
      escalation is often beneficial in patients with Crohn's disease who stop
      responding to infliximab treatment. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a post hoc analysis
      of A Crohn's Disease Clinical Trial Evaluating Infliximab in a New Long-term
      Treatment Regimen I (ACCENT I) to evaluate the association between serum
      infliximab trough levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) after 14 weeks of induction
      treatment with durable sustained long-term response (Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index decrease >/=70 points and reduction >/=25% from baseline). DESIGN: ACCENT I
      was a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled study. Week 14 trough levels
      and CRP percentage decrease from baseline to week 14 were compared between
      patients with and without durable sustained response through week 54. Sensitivity
      and specificity were determined to predict durable sustained response. Receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified optimal cut-off points; logistic
      regression determined ORs. RESULTS: After induction with 5 mg/kg infliximab, 25% 
      (37/147) and 33% (47/144) of patients sustained week 14 response to infliximab 5 
      or 10 mg/kg, respectively, administered every 8 weeks without dose escalation,
      through week 54. Median week 14 trough levels of patients with and without
      durable sustained response to infliximab 5 mg/kg were 4.0 and 1.9 mug/mL,
      respectively (p=0.0331). Optimal predictors of durable sustained response to
      maintenance infliximab 5 mg/kg were week 14 trough level >/=3.5 microg/mL and
      >/=60% CRP decrease (ORs (95% CI), 3.5 (1.1 to 11.4) and 7.3 (1.4 to 36.7)),
      respectively, in patients with raised baseline CRP (>8.0 mg/L); area under the
      ROC curve was 0.75 for both predictors. A >/=3.5 microg/mL week 14 infliximab
      serum level did not predict durable sustained response to 10 mg/kg maintenance
      infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with durable sustained response to maintenance 
      infliximab 5 mg/kg had higher postinduction trough levels than patients without
      durable sustained response. Serum infliximab trough levels >/=3.5 microg/mL and
      >/=60% CRP decrease were significantly associated with durable sustained
      response.

TI  - Exclusive enteral nutritional therapy can relieve inflammatory bowel stricture in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 790-5
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000041 [doi]
AB  - GOALS: To examine the efficiency of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in
      relieving inflammatory bowel stricture in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
      BACKGROUND: Patients with CD usually develop bowel strictures due to transmural
      edema of intestinal wall, which can potentially be managed with conservative
      medical treatment. Previous studies showed that EEN therapy could induce clinical
      remission through its anti-inflammation effect. METHODS: We achieved a
      prospective observational study. CD patients with inflammatory bowel stricture
      were preliminarily differentiated from a fibrous one, and further treated with
      EEN therapy for 12 weeks. Demographics and clinical variables were recorded.
      Nutritional (body mass index, albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin, etc.),
      inflammatory (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood
      cell, etc.), and radiologic parameters (bowel wall thickness, luminal diameter,
      and luminal cross-sectional area) were evaluated at baseline, week 4, and week
      12, respectively. RESULTS: Between May 2012 and January 2013, 65 patients with CD
      were preliminarily diagnosed with inflammatory bowel stricture and 6 patients
      were further excluded. Among the remaining 59 cases, 50 patients (84.7%) finished
      the whole EEN treatment, whereas the other 9 patients (15.3%) gained progressive 
      bowel obstruction resulting in surgery. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that
      48 patients (81.4%) achieved symptomatic remission, 35 patients (53.8%) achieved 
      radiologic remission, and 42 patients (64.6%) achieved clinical remission. Among 
      those patients who complete the whole EEN therapy, inflammatory, nutritional, and
      radiologic parameters improved significantly compared with baseline. Of note, the
      average luminal cross-sectional area at the site of stricture increased
      approximately 331% at week 12 (195.7 +/- 18.79 vs. 59.09 +/- 10.64 mm, P<0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: EEN therapy can effectively relieve inflammatory bowel stricture in 
      CD, which replenishes roles of enteral nutrition in the treatment of CD. Further 
      studies are expected to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this effect in
      the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A previous randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that
      infliximab maintenance therapy prevented recurrence of Crohn's disease 1 year
      after an ileocolonic resection. We evaluated recurrence of Crohn's disease, on
      the basis of endoscopic examination and/or the need for additional surgical
      resection, beyond the first postoperative year. METHODS: In a prospective,
      open-label, long-term follow-up study, 24 patients previously randomly assigned
      to receive infliximab for 1 year after an ileocolonic resection were given the
      option to continue, stop, or start infliximab therapy. The primary end point was 
      the time to recurrence of Crohn's disease, on the basis of endoscopic evidence
      (endoscopic recurrence), from the initial assignment to postoperative infliximab 
      or placebo. Secondary end points were rate of endoscopic recurrence, time to
      reoperation, and rate of surgical recurrence in relation to the total time on
      infliximab. RESULTS: All patients were followed for at least 5 years after
      surgery. Patients assigned to the infliximab group in the first year after
      surgery had a longer mean time to first endoscopic recurrence (1231 +/- 747 days)
      than patients originally assigned to the placebo group (460 +/- 121 days, P =
      .003). Colonoscopies identified Crohn's disease recurrence in 22.2% of patients
      who received long-term infliximab and in 93.9% of those not on infliximab (P <
      .0001). Compared with no infliximab, the adjusted rate ratio for being in
      endoscopic remission while on infliximab was 13.47 (95% confidence interval,
      3.52-61.53; P = .0001). Patients originally assigned to the infliximab group had 
      a mean longer time to surgery (1798 +/- 359 days) than patients originally
      assigned to the placebo group (1058 +/- 529 days, P = .04). The rate of surgical 
      recurrence (required additional surgical resection) was significantly lower among
      patients who received infliximab for most of the follow-up period than patients
      who received it for shorter periods (20.0% vs 64.3%, P = .047). CONCLUSIONS:
      Postoperative infliximab maintenance beyond 1 year prevents recurrence of Crohn's
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: "Fast-track" management (FT) challenges traditional postoperative
      tenets in order to minimize discomfort and optimize inpatient care. We examined
      the outcomes of consecutively performed laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for
      Crohn's disease (CD), with particular focus on FT's effects in patients with
      underlying bowel inflammation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients 
      undergoing isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD at our institution
      between 12/2000 and 12/2010, excluding patients with multiple areas of surgical
      CD, bladder involvement, or age >18years. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients aged
      8-18years underwent isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD, of which
      45 met FT criteria. Individual practice patterns primarily determined which
      patients were FT-managed. FT management led to decreased length of stay (LOS),
      time to first stool, time to full diet, and intravenous narcotic use. No
      significant difference in complications or disease progression was observed
      between the two groups during 2-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest 
      that FT is safe and effective in patients with CD. In a chronically ill
      population, counseling patients and families to expect early discharge is
      critical to the success of this strategy. Despite CD-related GI pathology, FT
      patients realized benefits in terms of LOS, time to bowel function, and narcotic 
      use without any increase in complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: No Crohn's disease (CD) molecular maker has advanced to clinical use, 
      and independent lines of evidence support a central role of the gut microbial
      community in CD. Here we explore the feasibility of extracting bacterial protein 
      signals relevant to CD, by interrogating myriads of intestinal bacterial
      proteomes from a small number of patients and healthy controls. DESIGN: We first 
      developed and validated a workflow-including extraction of microbial communities,
      two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and LC-MS/MS-to
      discover protein signals from CD-associated gut microbial communities. Then we
      used selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to confirm a set of candidates. In
      parallel, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing for an integrated analysis of gut
      ecosystem structure and functions. RESULTS: Our 2D-DIGE-based discovery approach 
      revealed an imbalance of intestinal bacterial functions in CD. Many proteins,
      largely derived from Bacteroides species, were over-represented, while
      under-represented proteins were mostly from Firmicutes and some Prevotella
      members. Most overabundant proteins could be confirmed using SRM. They correspond
      to functions allowing opportunistic pathogens to colonise the mucus layers,
      breach the host barriers and invade the mucosae, which could still be aggravated 
      by decreased host-derived pancreatic zymogen granule membrane protein GP2 in CD
      patients. Moreover, although the abundance of most protein groups reflected that 
      of related bacterial populations, we found a specific independent regulation of
      bacteria-derived cell envelope proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the
      first evidence that quantifiable bacterial protein signals are associated with
      CD, which can have a profound impact on future molecular diagnosis.

TI  - Detailed assessment of nutritional status and eating patterns in children with
      gastrointestinal diseases attending an outpatients clinic and contemporary
      healthy controls.
PG  - 700-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2013.286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical
      management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of
      malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly
      employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength 
      were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient
      gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2
      (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease:
      n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62
      contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results
      of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children 
      with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs
      0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2
      s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in
      children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip 
      strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of
      patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and
      the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with
      CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed
      significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks),
      spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of
      dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS:
      GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and 
      eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess vitamin D status of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease
      (CD) and to compare their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25OHD) with established
      cutoffs and assess whether 6 months of supplementation with 2000 IU/d, vs 400
      IU/d, would reduce the group prevalence of vitamin D below these cutoffs. STUDY
      DESIGN: Subjects 8-18 years (n = 83) with quiescent CD were randomized to either 
      400 or 2000 IU vitamin D3/d for 6 months. RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- SD s-25OHD
      was 24 +/- 8 ng/mL; 13 subjects (16%) had an s-25OHD <16 ng/mL, 27 (33%) < 20
      ng/mL, and 65 (79%) < 30 ng/mL. There was no significant difference between
      groups in achieving the cutoffs of 16 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL at 6 months; however,
      only 35% of the 400 IU group achieved the greater cutoff of 30 ng/mL compared
      with 74% in the 2000 IU group (P < .001). Baseline adjusted mean s-25OHD
      concentrations at 6 months were 9.6 ng/mL (95% CI 6.0-13.2, P < .001) greater in 
      the 2000 IU than the 400 IU group. Disease activity was not affected by
      supplement dose. Few subjects exceeded safety marker cutoffs, and this did not
      differ by dose. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, a high proportion of patients had a
      mean s-25OHD >20 ng/mL. 2000 IU vitamin D3/d is more effective in raising s-25OHD
      concentrations to > 30 ng/mL in children with CD than 400 IU/d, but both
      treatments were equally effective at achieving 16 or 20 ng/mL.

AB  - Increased dietary ratios of omega6/omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), but epidemiologic data
      are limited. We investigated whether variants of genes that control
      polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (CYP4F3, FADS1, and FADS2), along with the 
      dietary ratio of omega6/omega3, confers susceptibility to CD. Based on data from 
      182 children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who
      consumed a higher dietary ratio of omega6/omega3 were susceptible for CD if they 
      were also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes. Our findings
      implicate diet-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD.

TI  - ErbB receptors and their growth factor ligands in pediatric intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1038/pr.2013.210 [doi]
AB  - The ErbB tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2/HER2,
      ErbB3, and ErbB4) are cell surface growth factor receptors widely expressed in
      many developing mammalian tissues, including in the intestinal tract. Signaling
      elicited by these receptors promotes epithelial cell growth and survival, and
      ErbB ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents for intestinal diseases of 
      pediatric populations, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC), and inflammation associated with total parenteral nutrition 
      (TPN). Furthermore, emerging evidence points to reduced ErbB ligand expression
      and thus reduced ErbB activity in IBD, NEC, and TPN models. This review will
      discuss the current understanding of the role of ErbB receptors in the
      pathogenesis and potential treatment of pediatric intestinal inflammation, with
      focus on the altered signaling in disease and the molecular mechanisms by which
      exogenous ligands are protective.

TI  - Altered intestinal microbiota and blood T cell phenotype are shared by patients
      with Crohn's disease and their unaffected siblings.
PG  - 1578-86
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306226 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, altered 
      blood T cell populations, elevated faecal calprotectin (FC) and increased
      intestinal permeability (IP). CD-associated features present in siblings
      (increased risk of CD) but not in healthy controls, provide insight into early CD
      pathogenesis. We aimed to (1) Delineate the genetic, immune and microbiological
      profile of patients with CD, their siblings and controls and (2) Determine which 
      factors discriminate between groups. DESIGN: Faecal microbiology was analysed by 
      quantitative PCR targeting 16S ribosomal RNA, FC by ELISA, blood T cell phenotype
      by flow cytometry and IP by differential lactulose-rhamnose absorption in 22
      patients with inactive CD, 21 of their healthy siblings and 25 controls.
      Subject's genotype relative risk was determined by Illumina Immuno BeadChip.
      RESULTS: Strikingly, siblings shared aspects of intestinal dysbiosis with
      patients with CD (lower concentrations of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p=0.048),
      Clostridia cluster IV (p=0.003) and Roseburia spp. (p=0.09) compared with
      controls). As in CD, siblings demonstrated a predominance of memory T cells
      (p=0.002) and elevated naive CD4 T cell beta7 integrin expression (p=0.01)
      compared with controls. FC was elevated (>50 mug/g) in 8/21 (38%) siblings
      compared with 2/25 (8%) controls (p=0.028); whereas IP did not differ between
      siblings and controls. Discriminant function analysis determined that
      combinations of these factors significantly discriminated between groups
      (chi(2)=80.4, df=20, p<0.001). Siblings were separated from controls by
      immunological and microbiological variables. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy siblings of
      patients with CD manifest immune and microbiological abnormalities associated
      with CD distinct from their genotype-related risk and provide an excellent model 
      in which to investigate early CD pathogenesis.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes parameters for induction of remission in new onset
      pediatric Crohn's disease: evaluation of the porto IBD group "growth relapse and 
      outcomes with therapy" (GROWTH CD) study.
PG  - 278-85
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437735.11953.68 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robust evaluation of induction therapies using both clinical and
      inflammatory outcomes in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) are sparse. We attempted 
      to evaluate clinical, inflammatory, and composite outcomes of induction of
      remission therapies (normal C reactive protein [CRP] remission) in a large
      pediatric prospective multicenter study. METHODS: Patients enrolled at diagnosis 
      into the growth relapse and outcomes with therapy in Crohn's disease study were
      evaluated for disease activity, CRP, and fecal calprotectin at 8, 12 and 52 weeks
      after starting treatment. The primary endpoint was week-12 steroid-free remission
      defined by pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and CRP <0.5 mg/dL. The
      protocol required tapering off corticosteroids by week 11. RESULTS: We analyzed
      222 patients (mean age, 12.9 +/- 3.2 yr) main evaluated treatment options
      included: 5-ASA (n = 29), exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 43), and
      corticosteroids (n = 114). Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved in 155
      (73%) patients; both exclusive enteral nutrition and steroids were associated
      with normal CRP remission at week 12, although in a post hoc subgroup analysis
      exclusive enteral nutrition was superior in mild-to-moderate disease for this
      outcome. Among those in steroid-free remission in week 12, normal CRP predicted
      1-year sustained remission (86% for normal CRP versus 61% for elevated CRP; P =
      0.02). Baseline severity and early immunomodulation were similar in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Normal CRP steroid-free remission at week 12 was impacted by type of
      induction therapy, but not by early immunomodulation. It was associated with more
      corticosteroids-free remission at week 52 and a trend for less relapses.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis, not only affect the intestinal tract but also have an extraintestinal
      involvement within the oral cavity. These oral manifestations may assist in the
      diagnosis and the monitoring of disease activity, whilst ignoring them may lead
      to an inaccurate diagnosis and useless and expensive workups. Indurated tag-like 
      lesions, cobblestoning, and mucogingivitis are the most common specific oral
      findings encountered in CD cases. Aphthous stomatitis and pyostomatitis vegetans 
      are among non-specific oral manifestations of IBD. In differential diagnosis,
      side effects of drugs, infections, nutritional deficiencies, and other
      inflammatory conditions should also be considered. Treatment usually involves
      managing the underlying intestinal disease. In severe cases with local symptoms, 
      topical and/or systemic steroids and immunosuppressive drugs might be used.

TI  - Standard versus rapid food reintroduction after exclusive enteral nutritional
      therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 276-81
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In paediatric Crohn's disease (PCD), 6-8 weeks of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN) is effective in 60-80% cases. EEN is followed by gradual food
      reintroduction over variable (1-5 weeks) periods. Currently, there is no
      recommended duration or method for food reintroduction. The rationale for slow
      reintroduction is unclear and may be because of concerns about food intolerance
      or to maintain longer remission. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: to
      compare relapse rates following standard and rapid reintroduction of food after
      EEN in PCD and to determine the duration of maintained remission in two groups of
      PCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups with PCD were compared: group A
      received standard food reintroduction over 5 weeks and group B received rapid
      reintroduction over 3 days. Data were collected over two consecutive time
      periods: group A (2005-2009) and group B (2009-2011). Only patients with a new
      diagnosis of PCD were included. Those with strictures and those on steroids or
      biologicals during EEN were excluded. The minimum duration of follow-up was 1
      year. RESULTS: Group A included 20 patients and group B included 19 patients. In 
      these groups, EEN led to clinical remission in 80% of the patients in group A and
      in 76% of the patients in group B. At 6 months, one-third of the patients from
      each group had developed relapse and a year after EEN, 50% of the patients in
      group A and 47% of the patients in group B developed relapse. Time to first
      relapse was 188 days (group A) and 136 days (group B). None of these results were
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In PCD, rapid food reintroduction
      following 6-week EEN is safe and equally effective as longer food reintroduction.
      We propose that a rapid food reintroduction schedule be recommended as the most
      tolerable approach for food reintroduction. Relapse rate and duration of
      remission are uninfluenced by the type of food reintroduction.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease: current
      aspects.
PG  - 3-14
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.860557 [doi]
AB  - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could
      save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe
      nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN
      does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice
      for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive
      tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and
      essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in
      malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However,
      it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased
      rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is
      restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other
      complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short
      bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical
      for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy
      regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate
      and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also
      TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal 
      supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and
      nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated
      with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced 
      teams does not cause more complications than does EN.

TI  - Candidate genes involved in beneficial or adverse responses to commonly eaten
      brassica vegetables in a New Zealand Crohn's disease cohort.
PG  - 5046-64

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the two manifestations of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Particular foods are thought with CD to exacerbate their illness.
      Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because 
      of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. Brassicaceae 
      supply key nutrients which are necessary to meet recommended daily intakes. We
      sought to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse
      effects of Brassicaceae most commonly eaten, as reported by the New Zealand
      adults from the "Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel disease Study" based in
      Auckland. An analysis of associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) and the beneficial or adverse effects of the ten most commonly eaten
      Brassicaceae was carried out. A total of 37 SNPs were significantly associated
      with beneficial effects (p = 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs were identified with 
      adverse effects (p = 0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, 
      rs7515322 (DIO1) and rs9469220 (HLA) remained significant. Our findings show that
      the tolerance of some varieties of Brassicaceae may be shown by analysis of a
      person's genotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently manifests during
      childhood and adolescence. For providing and understanding a comprehensive
      picture of a patients' health status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
      instruments are an essential complement to clinical symptoms and functional
      limitations. Currently, the IMPACT-III questionnaire is one of the most
      frequently used disease-specific HRQoL instrument among patients with IBD.
      However, there is a lack of studies examining the validation and reliability of
      this instrument. METHODS: 146 paediatric IBD patients from the multicenter Swiss 
      IBD paediatric cohort study database were included in the study. Medical and
      laboratory data were extracted from the hospital records. HRQoL data were
      assessed by means of standardized questionnaires filled out by the patients in a 
      face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The original six IMPACT-III domain scales could 
      not be replicated in the current sample. A principal component analysis with the 
      extraction of four factor scores revealed the most robust solution. The four
      factors indicated good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha=.64-.86), good
      concurrent validity measured by correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN-27 scales
      and excellent discriminant validity for the dimension of physical functioning
      measured by HRQoL differences for active and inactive severity groups (p<.001,
      d=1.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study with Swiss children with IBD indicates good
      validity and reliability for the IMPACT-III questionnaire. However, our findings 
      suggest a slightly different factor structure than originally proposed. The
      IMPACT-III questionnaire can be recommended for its use in clinical practice. The
      factor structure should be further examined in other samples.

TI  - Delving into disability in Crohn's disease: dysregulation of molecular pathways
      may explain skeletal muscle loss in Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In Crohn's disease (CD), skeletal muscle mass and function are
      reduced compared to healthy controls, potentially resulting in disability.
      Mechanisms contributing to muscle impairment, and thus potential therapeutic
      targets, are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure and compare skeletal 
      muscle size and molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle growth, in CD
      subjects and healthy controls. METHODS: CD (n=27) and healthy (n=22) subjects
      were recruited from the IBD outpatient clinic and via local advertisement
      respectively. Demographics and clinical data were collected via survey and
      interview. Quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area was measured using peripheral
      quantitative CT scanning. Levels of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy signalling
      targets using quantitative PCR and western blotting were measured in muscle
      biopsies. RESULTS: Muscle size was 14% lower (p=0.055) and a 54% lower
      phosphorylated:total (p:t) Akt ratio was measured in the muscle samples (p<0.05),
      indicating an attenuated muscle hypertrophy pathway in CD compared with controls.
      In those with CD, a lower p:t Akt ratio (<0.97) was associated with lower serum
      vitamin D3, lower physical activity indices (49 vs 64 mmol/L, 1.7 vs 2.2x10(6)
      accelerometer counts respectively, each p<0.05) and a trend towards lower serum
      ferritin levels (128 vs 322mg/L, p=0.07), compared with CD subjects with
      normal/high p:t Akt ratios. CONCLUSION: The reduced muscle mass in CD may be
      explained, in part, by impaired activation of muscle protein synthesis pathways, 
      notably the IGF1-Akt pathway. Normal vitamin D levels and regular exercise may be
      protective in CD against this trend, though confirmatory longitudinal studies are
      needed.

PG  - 848-56
LID - 10.1177/1753425913513309 [doi]
AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition is established as an initial therapy to induce
      remission in active Crohn's disease (CD), especially in children, but the
      mechanisms of action of this therapy are yet to be fully defined. CEACAM6 protein
      is an adhesion molecule that is up-regulated in active CD and implicated in the
      attachment of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to the gut epithelium.
      Using the Caco-2 human adenocarcinoma cell line, this study showed that the
      incubation of human cells with a polymeric formula (PF) resulted in a
      dose-dependent increase in the expression of CEACAM6, and that this effect was
      most noticeable on the cell surface. Further investigation revealed that PF
      doubled the release of CEACAM6 protein by Caco-2 cells exposed to PF, and that an
      increase in release of soluble CEACAM6 inversely correlated with the ability of
      AIEC to associate with the intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that
      the secretion of cell surface-associated proteins acting as releasable decoys may
      be an aspect of the gut's innate immune response to pathogenic bacteria that is
      strengthened by PF in the setting of CD.

AB  - An association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to compare the disease
      course of patients with both MS and IBD with that of patients with isolated MS or
      isolated IBD. Sixty-six MS-IBD patients were identified and were matched with 251
      isolated MS and 257 isolated IBD controls. Main outcomes were scores using the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in MS and extent of disease extension in 
      IBD at last clinical evaluation. After a median 12 years of disease duration, the
      median EDSS and the percentages of patients reaching an EDSS of 3.0 and 4.0 were 
      significantly lower in MS-IBD patients than in controls. MS had no impact on IBD.
      MS course appears to be milder in patients with concomitant IBD.

TI  - [A comparative study of induction of remission and cost-effectiveness of enteral 
      nutrition versus infliximab in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease].
PG  - 721-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the induction of remission and cost-effectiveness of
      enteral nutrition (EN) and infliximab (IFX) in moderate-to-severe active Crohn's 
      disease(CD). METHODS: Moderate-to-severe active CD patients were divided into IFX
      group and EN group. Remission rate, time to remission and treatment cost were
      compared between the two groups. Clinical remission was defined as Crohn's
      disease activity index (CDAI) < 150. The quality of life was evaluated by
      inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire of quality of life (IBDQ). RESULTS: A
      total of 100 patients were analyzed, including 48 patients in IFX group and 52
      patients in EN group. IFX group had higher remission rate [87.5% (42/48) vs 67.3%
      (35/52) , P = 0.017] and shorter time to remission [(11.00 +/- 8.35) days vs
      (33.94 +/- 14.60) days, P < 0.001] than EN group. Treatment costs before
      remission were similar in two groups (P = 0.351) . The increase of IBDQ scores
      before and after treatment in IFX group was much higher than that of EN group
      (42.74 +/- 27.50 vs 7.57 +/- 22.77, P < 0.001) . Similarly, patients in EN group 
      had greater increase of body mass index (BMI) than that of IFX group [(1.32 +/-
      0.29)kg/m(2) vs (0.51 +/- 0.07) kg/m(2), P < 0.001]. For patients with CDAI <
      280, remission rate was not significantly different [85.7% (24/28) vs 81.8%
      (18/22) , P = 0.718] between the two groups, while treatment cost in EN group was
      less than that of IFX group [(16.1 +/- 5.9)x10(3) RMB vs (22.9 +/- 11.9)x10(3)
      RMB, P = 0.021]. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe CD (CDAI >/= 280), IFX has
      higher remission rate, shorter time to remission and comparable treatment cost
      than EN. But for patients with CDAI < 280, EN group has comparable remission rate
      to IFX group with lower cost.

TI  - British Dietetic Association evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management
      of Crohn's disease in adults.
PG  - 207-18
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
      Appropriate use of diet and nutritional therapy is integral to the overall
      management strategy of Crohn's disease. The aim was to develop evidence-based
      guidelines on the dietary management of Crohn's disease in adults. METHODS:
      Questions relating to the dietary management of Crohn's disease were developed.
      These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food
      re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission,
      and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or
      prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was
      conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified
      using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE,
      MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations,
      practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS:
      Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the
      basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, 
      enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative
      option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food
      re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help
      maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of
      strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of
      probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an
      alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce
      disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food
      re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to
      reduce variation in clinical practice.

TI  - Risk factors for relapse and surgery rate in children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 617-21
LID - 10.1007/s00431-013-2230-1 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors associated with
      the relapse rate in the first year and the need for surgery in children with
      Crohn's disease (CD). Data of all children (n = 74) diagnosed with CD from
      January 2004 to June 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariate Cox
      proportional hazards regression model was used to assess whether important
      clinical variables at diagnosis (age, presence of perianal disease, first
      induction therapy, first maintenance therapy, levels of Pediatric CD Activity
      Index (PCDAI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and standard deviation score (SDS) for
      height for weight) were associated with the risk of clinical recurrence in the
      first year and need for surgery during follow-up. Relapse occurred in 36 (48.6 %)
      patients in the first year from diagnosis. The only significant parameter
      associated with negative risk of relapse in the first year was exclusive enteral 
      nutrition (EEN) used as induction therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.469, 95 %
      confidence interval (CI) 0.232-0.948). EEN induced remission in 84.2 % of
      patients. The only risk associated with EEN treatment failure was the involvement
      of the upper gastrointestinal tract. During the follow-up, 25 (33.7 %) patients
      underwent surgery. The multivariate Cox regression model failed to recognize
      significant risk factor for surgery. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the
      importance of early EEN in the treatment of CD; it is not only efficacious in the
      remission induction but could also prevent relapse in the first year.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter gene SLC23A1 are
      associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.068015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and
      tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the
      initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid)
      supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of
      ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major
      ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants
      have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower
      systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common 
      genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the
      risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC
      (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n =
      142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and
      rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele
      for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to 
      CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001;
      respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and
      0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried
      more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was
      identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD
      cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of
      CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and
      provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for
      patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.

      inflammation in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/1479-7364-7-24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an essential immune response; however, chronic
      inflammation results in disease including Crohn's disease. Therefore, reducing
      the inflammation can yield a significant health benefit, and one way to achieve
      this is through diet. We developed a Mediterranean-inspired anti-inflammatory
      diet and used this diet in a 6-week intervention in a Crohn's disease population.
      We examined changes in inflammation and also in the gut microbiota. We compared
      the results of established biomarkers, C-reactive protein and the micronuclei
      assay, of inflammation with results from a transcriptomic approach. RESULTS: Data
      showed that being on our diet for 6 weeks was able to reduce the established
      biomarkers of inflammation. However, using transcriptomics, we observed
      significant changes in gene expression. Although no single gene stood out, the
      cumulative effect of small changes in many genes combined to have a beneficial
      effect. Data also showed that our diet resulted in a trend of normalising the
      microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that our Mediterranean-inspired diet
      appeared to benefit the health of people with Crohn's disease. Our participants
      showed a trend for reduced markers of inflammation and normalising of the
      microbiota. The significant changes in gene expression after 6 weeks highlighted 
      the increased sensitivity of using transcriptomics when compared to the
      established biomarkers and open up a new era of dietary intervention studies.

PG  - 7652-60
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i43.7652 [doi]
AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is well-established as a first line therapy
      instead of corticosteroid (CS) therapy to treat active Crohn's disease (CD) in
      children. It also has been shown to have benefits over and above induction of
      disease remission in paediatric populations. However, other than in Japanese
      populations, this intervention is not routinely utilised in adults. To
      investigate potential reasons for variation in response between adult studies of 
      EEN and CS therapy. The Ovid database was searched over a 6-mo period. Articles
      directly comparing EEN and CS therapy in adults were included. Eleven articles
      were identified. EEN therapy remission rates varied considerably. Poor compliance
      with EEN therapy due to unpalatable formula was an issue in half of the studies. 
      Remission rates of studies that only included patients with previously
      untreated/new CD were higher than studies including patients with both existing
      and new disease. There was limited evidence to determine if disease location,
      duration of disease or age of diagnosis affected EEN therapy outcomes. There is
      some evidence to support the use of EEN as a treatment option for a select group 
      of adults, namely those motivated to adhere to an EEN regimen and possibly those 
      newly diagnosed with CD. In addition, the use of more palatable formulas could
      improve treatment compliance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Telephone communication is common between healthcare providers
      and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We analyzed telephone
      activity at an IBD care center to identify disease and patient characteristics
      associated with high levels of telephone activity and determine if call volume
      could identify individuals at risk for future visits to the emergency department 
      (ED) or hospitalization. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study 
      in which we categorized telephone calls received by nursing staff over 2 years at
      a tertiary care IBD clinic (2475 patients in 2009 and 3118 in 2010). We analyzed 
      data on 21,979 ingoing and outgoing calls in 2009 and 32,667 calls in 2010 and
      assessed associations between clinical factors and logged telephone encounters,
      and between patterns of telephone encounters and future visits to the ED or
      hospitalization. RESULTS: Telephone encounters occurred twice as frequently as
      office visits; 15% of the patients generated >10 telephone encounters per year
      and were responsible for half of all telephone encounters. A higher percentage of
      these high telephone encounter (HTE) patients were female, had Crohn's disease,
      received steroid treatment, had increased levels of C-reactive protein and rates 
      of erythrocyte sedimentation, had psychiatric comorbidities, and had chronic
      abdominal pain than patients with lower telephone encounters. The HTE patients
      were also more frequently seen in the ED or hospitalized over the same time
      period and in subsequent years. Forty-two percent of patients with >8 telephone
      encounters within 30 days were seen in the ED or hospitalized within the
      subsequent 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of telephone records at
      an IBD clinic, 15% of patients account for half of all calls. These HTE patients 
      are a heterogeneous group with refractory disease who are likely to visit the ED 
      or be hospitalized.

TI  - High residential sun exposure is associated with a low risk of incident Crohn's
      disease in the prospective E3N cohort.
PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000436275.12131.4f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high
      risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the
      major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to
      analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of
      incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women
      living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 
      1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident
      cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun
      exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
      dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure
      and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models.
      RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a
      significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the
      first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for
      trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available
      data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher
      residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary
      vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was
      associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.

TI  - ESPGHAN revised porto criteria for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children and adolescents.
PG  - 795-806
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD)
      can be challenging in choosing the most informative diagnostic tests and
      correctly classifying PIBD into its different subtypes. Recent advances in our
      understanding of the natural history and phenotype of PIBD, increasing
      availability of serological and fecal biomarkers, and the emergence of novel
      endoscopic and imaging technologies taken together have made the previous Porto
      criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD obsolete. METHODS: We aimed to revise the
      original Porto criteria using an evidence-based approach and consensus process to
      yield specific practice recommendations for the diagnosis of PIBD. These revised 
      criteria are based on the Paris classification of PIBD and the original Porto
      criteria while incorporating novel data, such as for serum and fecal biomarkers. 
      A consensus of at least 80% of participants was achieved for all recommendations 
      and the summary algorithm. RESULTS: The revised criteria depart from existing
      criteria by defining 2 categories of ulcerative colitis (UC, typical and
      atypical); atypical phenotypes of UC should be treated as UC. A novel approach
      based on multiple criteria for diagnosing IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) is proposed.
      Specifically, these revised criteria recommend upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
      and ileocolonscopy for all suspected patients with PIBD, with small bowel imaging
      (unless typical UC after endoscopy and histology) by magnetic resonance
      enterography or wireless capsule endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These revised Porto
      criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD have been developed to meet present challenges
      and developments in PIBD and provide up-to-date guidelines for the definition and
      diagnosis of the IBD spectrum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) starting during childhood has been
      assumed to impair quality of life (QoL) of affected children. As this aspect is
      crucial for further personality development, the health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) was assessed in a Swiss nationwide cohort to obtain detailed information 
      on the fields of impairment. METHODS: Data were prospectively acquired from
      pediatric patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was
      evaluated by PCDAI and PUCAI. The age adapted KIDSCREEN questionnaire was
      evaluated for 110 children with IBD (64 with Crohn's disease 46 with ulcerative
      colitis). Data were analyzed with respect to established reference values of
      healthy controls. RESULTS: In the KIDSCREEN index a moderate impairment was only 
      found for physical wellbeing due to disease activity. In contrast, mental
      well-being and social support were even better as compared to control values. A
      subgroup analysis revealed that this observation was restricted to the children
      in the German speaking part of Switzerland, whereas there was no difference
      compared to controls in the French part of Switzerland. Furthermore, autonomy and
      school variables were significantly higher in the IBD patients as compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: The social support for children with IBD is excellent in
      this cohort. Only physical well-being was impaired due to disease activity,
      whereas all other KIDSCREEN parameters were better as compared to controls. This 
      indicates that effective coping and support strategies may be able to compensate 
      the burden of disease in pediatric IBD patients.

TI  - Exclusive enteral nutrition ameliorates mesenteric adipose tissue alterations in 
      patients with active Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy is a hallmark of Crohn's
      disease and can express various adipokines. Exclusive enteral nutrition could
      effectively induce remission in Crohn's disease with mechanisms largely unknown. 
      We investigated whether exclusive enteral nutrition could modify mesenteric fat
      in patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Sixteen patients who underwent 
      resection for ileum Crohn's disease were studied. As a control group, eight
      patients without inflammatory bowel disease were enrolled. Before operation,
      eight Crohn's disease patients received exclusive enteral nutrition for four
      weeks, and the other patients had no nutritional therapy. The mesenteric fat
      samples were obtained during operation. Adipocyte size, adipokine production and 
      topical C-reactive protein level were assessed. RESULTS: The adipocyte size from 
      patients treated with exclusive enteral nutrition was much larger than that from 
      Crohn's disease patients without nutritional therapy. Furthermore, protein levels
      of proinflammatory adipokines such as TNF-alpha and leptin were lower while
      protein level of adiponectin was higher in these patients. As to mRNA level, the 
      expression of adiponctin was up-regulated and leptin was down-regulated in the
      patients received enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition
      could ameliorate mesenteric fat alterations which are associated with intestinal 
      injury in patients with Crohn's disease by restoring adipocyte morphology and
      diminishing the inflammatory environment of mesenteric fat.

AB  - Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppressant drugs is a widely 
      discussed topic. Because therapeutic concepts have significantly changed, almost 
      no patient is currently without an immunosuppressant or biologic agent prior to
      surgery. However, the data whether biological agents and immunosuppressant are a 
      risk factor are very inconsistent. Concerning Crohn's disease, monotherapy with
      immunosuppressants or biological agents seems to have no negative influence on
      the postoperative results. In contrast, however, for ulcerative colitis more
      publications recognise biologic agents and immunosuppressants as a single therapy
      as a risk factor for infections. To reduce the general risk, all risk factors
      have to be reduced. In Crohn's disease, nutritional status must be optimised,
      corticoids should be reduced, biological agents and immunosuppressant drugs
      should be stopped, protection of an eventual anastomosis by a stoma. For
      ulcerative colitis in high-risk patients, a three-stage restaurative
      proctocolectomy is favoured to a one- or two-staged proctocolectomy.

TI  - Exogenous pigment in Peyer patches of children suspected of having IBD.
PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000221 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted 
      to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and
      aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet,
      and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of
      exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of 
      having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and
      the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to
      pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from
      children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a
      blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a
      semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were
      included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with
      non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in
      biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant
      correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P =
      0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD
      compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD
      (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for
      the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the
      terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer
      patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may
      have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted
      autophagy.

TI  - Increased effectiveness of early therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha vs
      an immunomodulator in children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 383-91

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Standard therapy for children newly diagnosed with Crohn's
      disease (CD) includes early administration of immunomodulators after initial
      treatment with corticosteroids. We compared the effectiveness of early (</=3 mo
      after diagnosis) treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha with
      that of an immunomodulator in attaining clinical remission and facilitating
      growth of pediatric patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from the RISK study, an
      observational research program that enrolled patients younger than age 17
      diagnosed with inflammatory (nonpenetrating, nonstricturing) CD from 2008 through
      2012 at 28 pediatric gastroenterology centers in North America. Patients were
      managed by physician dictate. From 552 children (median age, 11.8 y; 61% male;
      63% with pediatric CD activity index scores >30; and median C-reactive protein
      level 5.6-fold the upper limit of normal), we used propensity score methodology
      to identify 68 triads of patients matched for baseline characteristics who were
      treated with early anti-TNFalpha therapy, early immunomodulator, or no early
      immunotherapy. We evaluated relationships among therapies, corticosteroid and
      surgery-free remission (pediatric CD activity index scores, </=10), and growth at
      1 year for 204 children. Treatment after 3 months was a covariate. RESULTS: Early
      treatment with anti-TNFalpha was superior to early treatment with an
      immunomodulator (85.3% vs 60.3% in remission; relative risk, 1.41; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.14-1.75; P = .0017), whereas early immunomodulator therapy was
      no different than no early immunotherapy (60.3% vs 54.4% in remission; relative
      risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.83-1.48; P = .49) in achieving remission at 1 year.
      Accounting for therapy after 3 months, early treatment with anti-TNFalpha
      remained superior to early treatment with an immunomodulator (relative risk,
      1.51; 95% CI, 1.20-1.89; P = .0004), whereas early immunomodulator therapy was no
      different than no early immunotherapy (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75-1.34; P 
      = .99). The mean height z-score increased compared with baseline only in the
      early anti-TNFalpha group. CONCLUSIONS: In children newly diagnosed with
      comparably severe CD, early monotherapy with anti-TNFalpha produced better
      overall clinical and growth outcomes at 1 year than early monotherapy with an
      immunomodulator. Further data will be required to best identify children most
      likely to benefit from early treatment with anti-TNFalpha therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its subgroups in children in northeastern
      Slovenia (NE Slovenia) during the period 2002-2010, and to assess the phenotypic 
      characteristics at the diagnosis and during the follow-up. METHODS: A
      retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of newly diagnosed children
      and adolescents with IBD ages 0 to 18 years between 2002 and 2010 and residing in
      NE Slovenia. The phenotypic characteristics were determined at presentation and
      during follow-up. The location of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      was assessed according to the Paris classification at diagnosis, and later in
      patients who had a follow-up period >2 years. The type of therapy at diagnosis
      and during follow-up, and the need for surgery were determined. The study covered
      approximately one-third of the total pediatric population (0-18 years). RESULTS: 
      In total, 107 cases of IBD were diagnosed during the study period. The mean
      annual incidence (per 100,000) was 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) for
      all IBD, 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9) for CD, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-3.8) for UC. The
      incidences of total IBD, CD, and UC increased from 5.7 (3.8-8.2), 3.9 (2.3-6.1), 
      and 1.8 (0.8-3.5) in the period 2002-2004, respectively, to 8.9 (6.3-12.2), 5.0
      (3.1-7.6), and 3.4 (1.9-5.6) in the period 2008-2010, respectively. During the
      follow-up, the proportion of complicated CD disease behavior
      (stricturing/penetrating) had doubled. A total of 18.5% of patients with CD
      underwent bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood IBD in the
      northeastern part of the country is high and comparable with that reported from
      the developed western countries of Europe, and is probably still increasing. This
      increase may be the result of changes in the lifestyle, especially in dietary
      habits during the last 20 years.

TI  - Pathological fractures in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 141-51
LID - 10.1007/s00431-013-2174-5 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's
      disease (CD), is commonly associated with poor skeletal health, related to the
      direct effects of chronic inflammation, prolonged use of glucocorticoid (GC),
      poor nutrition, delayed puberty and low muscle mass. Low bone mineral density is 
      commonly reported, although the prevalence of long bone fractures may not be
      increased in these patients. Emerging evidence however suggests that there may be
      an increased risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) in this group. VFs presenting at
      diagnosis of paediatric CD, prior to any GC exposure, have been reported,
      highlighting the deleterious effect of inflammation on skeletal health. This
      paper reviews the published literature on pathophysiology of skeletal morbidity
      and fractures in paediatric IBD, illustrated with a new case report of multiple
      VFs in a prepubertal girl with CD, soon after diagnosis, who received minimal
      amounts of oral GC. Optimising control of disease, addressing vitamin D
      deficiency, encouraging physical activity and ensuring normal growth and pubertal
      progression are paramount to management of bone health in these patients. Despite
      the lack of evidence, there may be a place for bisphosphonate treatment,
      especially in the presence of symptomatic pathological fractures, but this
      requires close monitoring by clinicians with expertise in paediatric bone health.
      CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines may have 
      adverse effects on skeletal health in paediatric patients with IBD. The risk of
      vertebral fractures may be increased, even without exposure to glucocorticoid.
      Clinical monitoring of these patients requires careful attention to the various
      factors that impact on bone health.

PG  - 1882-8
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31829f03ee [doi]
AB  - Although the significance of focally enhanced gastritis (FEG) as a marker of
      Crohn disease (CD) in adults has been contested, several studies suggest that it 
      may be more specific of CD in pediatric patients. This study describes the
      detailed histologic features of FEG in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      and clarifies its association with CD. A series of 119 consecutive newly
      diagnosed IBD patients (62 CD cases, 57 ulcerative colitis [UC] cases) with upper
      and lower gastrointestinal biopsies were evaluated. The histology of the gastric 
      biopsies was reviewed blinded to final diagnoses and compared with age-matched
      healthy controls (n=66). FEG was present in 43% of IBD patients (CD 55% vs. UC
      30%, P=0.0092) and in 5% of controls. Among CD patients, FEG was more common in
      younger patients (73% in children aged 10 y and below, 43% in children above 10 y
      of age, P=0.0358), with the peak in the 5- to 10-year age group (80%). The total 
      number of glands involved in each FEG focus was higher in UC (6.4+/-5.1 glands)
      than in CD (4.0+/-3.0 glands, P=0.0409). Amongst the CD cohort, patients with FEG
      were more likely than those without FEG to have active ileitis (79% vs. 40%,
      P=0.0128) and granulomas elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (82% vs. 43%,
      P=0.0016). There was no correlation between FEG and other gastrointestinal
      findings of UC. We demonstrate that differences in FEG seen in pediatric CD and
      UC relate to not only their frequencies but also the morphology and relationship 
      with other gastrointestinal lesions. Further, FEG is associated with disease
      activity and the presence of granulomas in pediatric CD.

TI  - Review article: the association of diet with onset and relapse in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1172-87
LID - 10.1111/apt.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by 
      migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To 
      give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or
      relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A
      structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using 
      defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5)
      or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or
      sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or
      vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk.
      However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of
      other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in
      CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and
      grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for
      unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or
      inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which
      only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of
      specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large
      prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are
      needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.

PG  - 2625-33
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437043.36338.21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for patients with Crohn's disease who 
      have loss of response to the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medication
      infliximab is uncertain. Natalizumab has an alternative mechanism of action, but 
      its use has been limited by the risk of progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy. In this study, we performed a decision analysis assessing
      the impact of JC virus (JCV) antibody testing and natalizumab utilization for
      loss of response to infliximab. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to assess 
      the difference between unscreened natalizumab use (option 1), JCV antibody
      testing with natalizumab when appropriate (option 2), and second anti-tumor
      necrosis factor alpha use (option 3). The base case was a 35-year-old man with
      severe Crohn's disease with loss of response to infliximab. The time horizon was 
      3 years. Results are reported in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
      Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were conducted. Markov analysis using a 
      cohort of 5000 individuals was performed. The impact of JCV antibody status on
      outcomes in this model was assessed. RESULTS: Option 2 was the preferred strategy
      (2.0880 QALYs), followed by option 1 (2.0875 QALYs) and option 3 (2.0808 QALYs). 
      Patients in option 2 required fewer surgeries compared with option 3. Previous
      JCV infection was associated with reduced QALYs with all options that allowed for
      natalizumab use. CONCLUSIONS: JCV antibody testing and subsequent treatment
      selection yield improved outcomes over natalizumab without testing or using only 
      a second anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha in all patients.

TI  - Transforming growth factor and intestinal inflammation: the role of nutrition.
PG  - 91-8
LID - 10.1159/000351390 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal mucosa possesses a complex epithelial barrier and a well-organized
      local immune system, which both efficiently protect this internal-external
      surface against potential microbial aggressions while guaranteeing tolerance
      towards harmless bacteria or antigens (oral tolerance). There is good
      experimental evidence that the intestinal microbiota is a main driver for the
      development of the mucosal immune system. Any perturbations/changes of this
      interaction with the intestinal microbiota or the microbial colonization process 
      may cause health problems with short- and eventually long-term consequences, such
      as suspected for allergic or dysimmune disorders. Dendritic cells (DC) play a key
      role in the initiation of immune responses. Immune responses elicited by
      intestinal DC differ markedly from those initiated by spleen-derived DC: while
      intestinal DC induce anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses to harmless
      antigens such as derived from the resident microflora or harmless food allergens,
      systemic immune activation yields in a strong inflammatory TH1/TH17 reaction to
      the same antigens. The recent discovery how DC functions are regulated and
      imprinted by the microenvironment (DC conditioning) will be discussed in this
      review. High concentrations of retinoic acid or vitamin D metabolites, thymic
      stromal lymphopoietin and/or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activate 
      signaling programs in DC that yield in priming of regulatory and
      anti-inflammatory T cell responses. TGF-beta is one of the key factors implicated
      in intestinal immune regulation; it is produced by a large variety of cells in
      the intestinal mucosa, including intestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes and
      monocytes/macrophages/DC. An important anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta on
      the immune system is the promotion and generation of FOXP3-positive regulatory T 
      cells in the intestinal compartment. There are first and encouraging data from
      the treatment of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory GI condition, that targeted
      enteral therapy with optimized concentrations of immunoregulatory peptides, such 
      as TGF-beta, might of interest for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

      dose.
PG  - 2652-8
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000436960.00405.56 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiopurine immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are
      widely used to maintain remission in children with both Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic efficacy is associated with higher red blood cell
      levels of the thiopurine metabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). Studies in both
      children and adults have inexplicably failed to demonstrate a significant
      correlation between prescribed dose and level of 6-TGN. We aimed to quantify the 
      relationship between 6-TGN levels and adherence. METHODS: We used electronic
      monitoring devices to assess adherence in children and adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel diseases who were prescribed 6-MP. RESULTS: During 3230 days
      of monitoring in 19 subjects, adherence to 6-MP was 74.2%. Due to the generally
      low adherence to the prescribed dose of 6-MP, the 6-TGN level was not correlated 
      with the prescribed dose. The 6-TGN level was significantly correlated with the
      adherence-adjusted dose (R(2) = 0.395). It was also significantly correlated to
      adherence alone (R(2) = 0.478). Adherence to 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-MP were 
      significantly positively correlated (r(s)(9) = 0.82, P = 0.00), and a significant
      relationship was found between 5-aminosalicylic acid adherence and 6-TGN levels
      independent of 6-MP adherence. Furthermore, low adherence to 6-MP was associated 
      with increased likelihood of escalation of medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Red
      blood cell 6-TGN levels are strongly correlated with the dose, when the dose is
      actually taken. Lack of efficacy of thiopurines may often be the result of poor
      adherence. Novel ways of assessing and improving adherence are necessary. Future 
      trials should assess adherence in study participants. Intake of 5-aminosalicylic 
      acid positively influences 6-TGN levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with Crohn's disease (CD) suffer from malnutrition.
      Understanding substrate utilization during exercise may help patients with CD
      sustain a healthy active lifestyle without compromising nutrition. The aim of
      this study was to determine whether substrate utilization and bioavailability
      during exercise are altered in children with CD compared with controls. METHODS: 
      Seven children with CD (mean age +/- SD: 15.2 +/- 2.3 yr) and 7 controls (14.4
      +/- 2.3 yr) were matched by sex and biological age. Participants completed 60
      minutes of cycling at an intensity equivalent to 50% of their peak mechanical
      power. Rates of total fat and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation, the amount of fat and
      CHO oxidized, and the contribution of fat and CHO to total energy expenditure
      were calculated from expired gases collected during exercise. Blood was collected
      before, during, and at the end of exercise and analyzed for insulin, free fatty
      acids, and glucose. RESULTS: Whole-body fat oxidation rate (expressed in mg .
      kg(-1) of body weight per min) during exercise was lower in children with CD (5.8
      +/- 1.0) compared with controls (8.0 +/- 2.2, P < 0.05). Children with CD relied 
      significantly more on CHO, with approximately 10% greater contribution toward
      total energy expenditure (P < 0.05) than controls. There were no differences in
      plasma insulin, free fatty acids, or glucose between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Fat
      metabolism during exercise seems to be impaired in children with CD. A greater
      reliance on CHO is required to meet the energy demands of submaximal exercise.

TI  - Review article: evidence-based dietary advice for patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1156-71
LID - 10.1111/apt.12500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD)
      and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to
      support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.
      AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and
      activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review
      of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings
      'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' 
      and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is
      effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6
      months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any 
      other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports
      recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty
      foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be
      tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and
      margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also
      correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little
      evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations.
      Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence'
      rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be
      inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary
      manipulation are urgently required.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the major cause of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most well known bacterial pathogen
      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enterotoxigenic Clostridium
      perfringens has also been detected in up to 15% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      cases, and it has not been found in healthy people. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens infection in pediatric patients with
      IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study evaluating pediatric IBD
      patients in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Warsaw,
      Poland. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the Porto criteria. There
      were two control groups: (1) non-IBD patients that were suspected for bacterial
      diarrhea and (2) healthy children. Stool samples were collected on the day of
      admission. C. perfringens infection diagnosis was based on a positive stool
      enzyme immunoassay (C. perfringens enterotoxin test kit TechLab). RESULTS: 91
      fecal specimens from patients with IBD were collected. The average patient age
      was 11.7 years in IBD group, 7.4 years in non-IBD patients with diarrhea, and 7.4
      years in healthy children. The prevalence of C. perfringens infection was 9%
      (8/91; CI 95% 4.6-16.4). There were more Crohn's patients (6/8) in the C.
      perfringens positive group. There was no C. perfringens infection in the two
      control groups. CONCLUSION: Our pilot data add evidence to the hypothesis that
      Clostridia other than C. difficile may play a significant role in the clinical
      course of IBD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this.

LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a82b15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjusting to symptom flares, treatment regimens, and side effects
      places youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at increased risk for
      emotional and behavioral problems and adverse disease outcomes. Implementation of
      psychosocial screening into clinical practice remains a challenge. This study
      examines the clinical utility of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) screening
      in predicting disease outcome and healthcare utilization. METHODS: One hundred
      twelve youth of 7 to 18 years diagnosed with IBD and their parents. Youth
      completed standardized measures of HRQOL and depression. Parents completed a
      proxy report of HRQOL. Pediatric gastroenterologists provided the Physician
      Global Assessment. Families were recruited from a pediatric gastroenterology
      clinic. Retrospective chart reviews examined disease outcome and healthcare
      utilization for 12 months after baseline measurement. RESULTS: Linear
      regressions, controlling for demographic and disease parameters, revealed that
      baseline measurement of youth and parent proxy-reported HRQOL predicted the
      number of IBD-related hospital admissions, gastroenterology clinic visits,
      emergency department visits, psychology clinic visits, telephone contacts, and
      pain management referrals over the next 12 months. Disease outcome was not
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HRQOL was predictive of increased healthcare
      utilization among youth with IBD. Regular HRQOL screening may be the impetus to
      providing better case management and allocating resources based on ongoing care
      needs and costs. Proactive interventions focused on patients with poor HRQOL may 
      be an efficient approach to saving on healthcare costs and resource utilization.

TI  - Nutritional therapy in pediatric Crohn disease: the specific carbohydrate diet.
PG  - 87-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in 
      the absence of a recognized etiology. Nutritional therapy in the form of
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has an established role within pediatric Crohn 
      disease. Following exclusive enteral nutrition's success, many dietary therapies 
      focusing on the elimination of specific complex carbohydrates have been
      anecdotally reported to be successful. METHODS: Many of these therapies have not 
      been evaluated scientifically; therefore, we reviewed the medical records of our 
      patients with Crohn disease on the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). RESULTS:
      Seven children with Crohn disease receiving the SCD and no immunosuppressive
      medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy
      ranged from 5 to 30 months, with an average of 14.6+/-10.8 months. Although the
      exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review,
      all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit 3 months after
      initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, 
      C-reactive protein, hematocrit, and stool calprotectin, either normalized or
      significantly, improved during follow-up clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: This chart
      review suggests that the SCD and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be
      possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn disease. Further prospective
      studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD, or any
      other low complex SCDs in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.

PG  - 29-42
LID - 10.1007/s40272-013-0046-0 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease (CD), can potentially
      cause growth failure during childhood as well as a reduction in final adult
      height. The underlying mechanism is multifactorial and includes poor nutrition,
      chronic inflammation, and the prolonged use of steroids. Despite major advances
      in the treatment of CD, current cohorts of children continue to display a deficit
      in linear growth and may qualify for growth-promoting hormonal therapy. However, 
      currently there is limited evidence to support the use of endocrine therapy
      directed primarily at improving growth. This review is aimed at summarising the
      current evidence for growth impairment in inflammatory bowel disease and
      discusses the rationale for using growth promoting therapy.

TI  - Challenging question: can we diagnose Crohn's disease without histology?
PG  - 202-6
LID - 10.1159/000353368 [doi]
AB  - No single test is diagnostic of Crohn's disease (CD). In the presence of a
      compatible clinical presentation, diagnosis is by convention confirmed by a
      combination of imaging, serologic, endoscopic and histologic investigations. This
      diagnostic recommendation should be maintained, even though histology is often
      'compatible with' rather than 'diagnostic of' suspected CD. The importance of
      histology varies depending on the specific sites of macroscopic disease.
      Histology is particularly important in distinguishing type of inflammatory bowel 
      disease, when the colon predominantly is involved, and in confirming CD when
      macroscopic disease is atypically located.

PG  - 909613
LID - 10.1155/2013/909613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a well-established approach to
      the management of Crohn's disease. Aim. To determine effects of EEN upon
      inflammation and gut barrier function in a colitis mouse model. METHODS:
      Interleukin-10-deficient mice (IL-10(-/-)) were inoculated with Helicobacter
      trogontum and then treated with EEN, metronidazole, hydrocortisone, or EEN and
      metronidazole combination. Blood and tissue were collected at 2 and 4 weeks with 
      histology, mucosal integrity, tight junction integrity, inflammation, and H.
      trogontum load evaluated. RESULTS: H. trogontum induced colitis in IL-10(-/-)
      mice with histological changes in the cecum and colon. Elevated mucosal IL-8 mRNA
      in infected mice was associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction indicated by 
      decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and mRNA of tight junction
      proteins and increased short-circuit current, myosin light chain kinase mRNA,
      paracellular permeability, and tumor necrosis factor- alpha and myeloperoxidase
      plasma levels (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). EEN and metronidazole, but not
      hydrocortisone, treatments restored barrier function, maintained gut barrier
      integrity, and reversed inflammatory changes along with reduction of H. trogontum
      load (versus infected controls P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: H. trogontum infection in
      IL-10(-/-) mice induced typhlocolitis with intestinal barrier dysfunction. EEN
      and metronidazole, but not hydrocortisone, modulate barrier dysfunction and
      reversal of inflammatory changes.

TI  - Use of exclusive enteral nutrition is just as effective as corticosteroids in
      newly diagnosed pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 3584-91
LID - 10.1007/s10620-013-2855-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in induction of
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is reported to be equivalent to that 
      of corticosteroids (CS). AIMS: Our objective was to compare the efficacy of EEN
      and CS in inducing remission in pediatric onset CD and the effects of the
      treatment on nutritional status and bone mineral density (BMD). METHODS: Medical 
      charts were retrospectively studied for patients diagnosed with CD between 2000
      and 2010 at the Stollery children's hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. Anthropometric
      and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data were collected to assess effects 
      of therapy; clinical remission, relapse, and severity were defined on the basis
      of the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. RESULTS: To induce remission at 
      first presentation, 36 patients (mean age 12.9 years) received EEN and 69 (mean
      age 11.2 years) received CS. Remission (88.9% in the EEN group versus 91.3% in
      the CS group (p=0.73) at 3 months) and relapse (40.6 vs. 28.6%, respectively
      (p=0.12) over 12 months) were similar in both treatment groups. Thirty-four
      patients had paired DXA scans at the time of diagnosis and one year later: 16
      given EEN and 18 given CS. Change in BMD spine z-scores based on bone age
      adjusted for height and chronological age was greater for EEN patients but not
      statistically significant (Deltaz-score 0.30 vs. 0.03, p=0.28). CONCLUSIONS: EEN 
      has similar efficacy to corticosteroids; however, EEN may lead to better BMD
      accrual. EEN should be preferred to corticosteroids as first-line therapy for
      induction of remission in pediatric CD.

AB  - Few cases of Crohn's disease complicated with meningitis and epidural abscess
      have been described in literature. We present a case of a 42-year-old former
      smoker female patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease in September 1995 (with
      severe nutritional problems). On 20 February 2012, she was admitted due to a
      probable sepsis (without any previous treatment). After several days she
      developed a confusion syndrome (probable Wernicke's disease). On 5 March 2012,
      the patient presented with a febrile episode of 39 degrees C. Two days later, the
      patient presented aphasia and paraparesis, and 3 days later she presented a
      complex partial status epilepticus. A lumbar puncture was performed and showed
      131 leucocytes (63% granulocytes) and proteins 296.3. The abdominopelvic CT scan 
      revealed a presacral collection that seem to extend cranially towards the
      lumbosacral spine. The lumbar MRI confirmed the lumbar epidural abscess secondary
      to the fistulisation of the presacral abscess.

TI  - Exploring associations of 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels and other predictive
      factors with therapeutic response to azathioprine in pediatric patients with IBD 
      using multilevel analysis.
PG  - 2404-10
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a508c6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolite monitoring and response predictors to azathioprine (AZA)
      in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are debatable. In an attempt to
      optimize thiopurine therapy and understand the mechanism of action of
      thiopurines, we correlated metabolites and other factors with AZA efficacy in
      children with IBD. METHODS: Data from 86 children with IBD with 440 metabolite
      measurements were retrospectively analyzed using multilevel logistic regression
      analyses. A therapeutic response was defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease
      activity index </=10 for Crohn's disease or a pediatric ulcerative colitis
      activity index </=10 for ulcerative colitis without any treatment with steroids, 
      antitumor necrosis factor, other immunomodulators, or exclusive enteral
      nutrition. RESULTS: The 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels >250 pmol per 8 x 10 red 
      blood cells correlated with a higher response (odds ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.49-11.46, P = 0.007), whereas 6-methyl-mercaptopurine and
      6-methyl-mercaptopurine:6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio showed no correlation.
      Other novel response predictors in children with IBD were relative leukopenia
      (odds ratio, 14.01; 95% confidence interval, 3.77-52.10; P < 0.001) and the
      absence of lymphopenia (odds ratio, 3.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-10.89; P 
      = 0.017). Lower thiopurine methyltransferase activity (P = 0.015), lower platelet
      count (P = 0.020), and higher aspartate aminotransferase level (P = 0.009) also
      predicted therapeutic response. Age, gender, patient adherence, the duration of
      AZA therapy, IBD type, erythrocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate did 
      not predict efficacy. The high interindividual variability accounting for 57.7%
      of variance in therapeutic response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The significant
      6-thioguanine nucleotide level-response relationship may support metabolite
      monitoring to improve thiopurine efficacy in pediatric IBD. The reported response
      predictors may be helpful for treatment optimization in AZA-treated children with
      IBD, but should be proved in prospective studies.

TI  - Quantification and characterization of mucosa-associated and intracellular
      Escherichia coli in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2326-38
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a38a92 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucosa-associated Escherichia coli are abundant in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), but whether these bacteria gain intracellular access within the
      mucosa is uncertain. If E. coli does gain intracellular access, the contribution 
      of bacterial pathogenicity to this requires further elucidation. This study aimed
      to quantify and characterize mucosa-associated and intracellular E. coli in
      patients with IBD and in healthy control subjects (HC). METHODS: Mucosal biopsies
      from 30 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 
      14 HC were cultured with or without gentamicin protection to recover
      intracellular or mucosa-associated E. coli, respectively. Overall, 40 strains
      (CD: n = 24, UC: n = 9, and HC: n = 7) were characterized by phylogenetic typing,
      adhesion and invasion assays, detection of virulence factors, antimicrobial
      resistance genes, and proteomic analysis. RESULTS: Mucosa-associated E. coli were
      more abundant in CD and UC than in HC (2750 versus 1350 versus 230 median
      colony-forming units per biopsy; P = 0.01). Intracellular E. coli were more
      prevalent in CD (90%) than in UC (47%) or HC mucosal biopsies (0%) (P < 0.001).
      Of 24 CD strains, 2 were adherent and invasive, but there were no unifying
      pathogenicity determinants that could distinguish most CD strains from UC or HC
      strains, or intracellular isolates from mucosa-associated isolates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Intracellular E. coli are more common in CD than in UC and not identified in HC. 
      Most intracellular E. coli did not have characterizing pathogenic features,
      suggesting a significant role for defects in mucosal immunity or barrier
      dysfunction in their ability to gain intracellular access.

LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2013.158 [doi]
AB  - IBD includes two classic entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and a 
      third undetermined form (IBD-U), characterized by a chronic relapsing course
      resulting in a high rate of morbidity and impaired quality of life. Children with
      IBD are vulnerable in terms of growth failure, malnutrition and emotional
      effects. The aims of therapy have now transitioned from symptomatic control to
      the achievement of mucosal healing and deep remission. This type of therapy has
      been made possible by the advent of disease-modifying drugs, such as biologic
      agents, which are capable of interrupting the inflammatory cascade underlying
      IBD. Biologic agents are generally administered in patients who are refractory to
      conventional therapies. However, there is growing support that such agents could 
      be used in the initial phases of the disease, typically in paediatric patients,
      to interrupt and cease the inflammatory process. Until several years ago, most
      therapeutic programmes in paediatric patients with IBD were borrowed from adult
      trials, whereas paediatric studies were often retrospective and uncontrolled.
      However, guidelines on therapeutic management of paediatric IBD and controlled,
      prospective, randomized trials including children with IBD have now been
      published. Here, the current knowledge concerning treatment options for children 
      with IBD are reported. We also highlight the effectiveness and safety of new
      therapeutic advances in these paediatric patients.

      inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 2440-3

AB  - PURPOSE: Poor sleep quality is associated with adverse health consequences. Sleep
      disturbances can impact the immune function and process of inflammation. The
      relationship between sleep quality and the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has
      not been well studied. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was
      performed to assess the correlation of the quality of sleep and disease activity 
      in IBD. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure sleep
      quality. IBD disease activity was measured by using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or 
      Modified Mayo Score. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled with mean age of
      37 +/- 15.4 years and 27 (66%) women. Abnormal PSQI was present in all 23 (100%) 
      of the clinically active patients and in 13 (72%) of those with inactive disease 
      (odds ratio = 2.8, P = 0.007). All 30 patients with histologic evidence of
      inflammation on recent ileocolonoscopy also had abnormal PSQI scores, which were 
      independent of their clinical disease activity status. Only 6 of 11 patients with
      histologically quiescent disease had abnormal PSQI scores (odds ratio = 6.0, P < 
      0.0001). There was no difference in disease type, use of steroids, the presence
      of depression or anxiety, and body mass index between the patients with normal
      and abnormal sleep. An abnormal PSQI had a positive predictive value for
      histologic inflammatory activity of 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a strong
      association between clinically active IBD and poor sleep quality and demonstrate 
      that patients in clinical remission with abnormal sleep have a high likelihood of
      subclinical disease activity.

TI  - Outcomes following surgery for perforating Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1344-8
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common indications for surgery for patients with ileocolic
      Crohn's disease are fibrostenotic or perforating disease. The objective was to
      compare surgical outcomes of patients with perforating versus non-perforating
      disease following ileocolic resection. METHODS: This was a retrospective review
      of all patients who had their first ileocolic resection between 1990 and 2010,
      identified from a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database.
      Demographic information, preoperative medication, intraoperative findings and
      postoperative outcome data were collected. Outcomes in patients who had an
      abscess drained before surgery or were found to have a fistula or abscess at
      surgery or at pathology were compared with outcomes in all others. RESULTS: A
      total of 434 patients (56.2 per cent women) were included, 293 with perforating
      and 141 with non-perforating disease. Median age, tobacco use, and preoperative
      steroid and biological agent use were similar in the two groups. Forty patients
      (13.7 per cent) in the perforating group had abscesses drained before surgery and
      251 patients had at least one fistula, most commonly to the sigmoid colon.
      Patients with perforating disease were more likely to require preoperative total 
      parenteral nutrition, need another resection, have an ileostomy and a longer mean
      postoperative stay, and less likely to undergo a laparoscopic procedure. Patients
      in this group also developed more postoperative abscesses or leaks (4.8 versus 0 
      per cent; P = 0.006). The reoperation rate was similar (3.1 versus 0.7 per cent; 
      P = 0.178). CONCLUSION: Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease are more likely
      to require a more complex procedure, and an ileostomy, and to a have longer
      postoperative stay.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association of fatigue with decreased physical performance
      and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed
      to measure and compare self-reported fatigue with skeletal muscle fatigue in CD
      subjects and healthy controls, and to identify associated factors that may be
      amenable to change. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected and
      fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) in 27 consecutive CD
      patients and 22 matched healthy controls. Circulating cytokines and growth
      factors were measured. The rate of quadriceps muscle fatigue was assessed using
      an isokinetic dynamometer as the decrement of force with 30 contractions
      performed over a 5-minute period. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, CD
      patients reported greater levels of fatigue (mean global FIS score 45.3 vs 10.5, 
      physical dimension score 12.3 vs 2.7 respectively; each p<0.01) and muscle
      fatigue (-5.2 vs -1.3 Nm min(-1); p<0.05). The two indices were correlated (r =
      -0.52 in CD; p<0.01). Patients with CD had lower mean serum IGF-1 levels (16.1 vs
      25.4 pmol/L, p<0.01) and higher oxidative stress (TBARS assay 4.3 vs 3.9 muM,
      p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, low serum vitamin D, IGF-1 and magnesium, and 
      higher IL-6 levels were associated with increased muscle fatigue (all p </=
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with CD had more muscle fatigue than matched healthy 
      controls and this correlated well with self-reported fatigue. Of circulating
      factors that were independently associated with increased muscle fatigue, vitamin
      D, magnesium and IGF-1 could be targeted in future studies to reduce fatigue and 
      improve physical performance.

AB  - Since the introduction of biological therapy, endoscopic and histological
      remission, i.e. mucosal healing, has become an important therapeutic goal in
      Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Mucosal healing is associated with lower 
      rates of hospitalization and surgery, although its role in preventing progression
      and changing the natural history of the disease has not been clearly
      demonstrated. A precise definition of mucosal healing has not yet been
      established, although the concept used in clinical trials is the "complete
      absence of all inflammatory and ulcerative lesions in all segments of gut" at
      endoscopy. This definition does not include mucosal improvement and does not
      distinguish among grades of mucosal healing. In both Crohn's Disease and
      Ulcerative Colitis trials, several qualitative and quantitative numeric
      endoscopic indices have been proposed to measure and distinguish endoscopic
      changes. In addition, the microscopic features associated with inflammatory bowel
      diseases are considerably modified by the course of the disease and the
      treatments adopted. However, it is not yet clear whether microscopic healing
      should be a primary endpoint in clinical trials. In this paper we discuss
      endoscopic and histological findings and the limitations of the endoscopic and
      histological indices as a basis for a standardised diagnosis of mucosal healing.

AB  - The human gut is a unique organ in which hundreds of different microbial species 
      find their habitat and in which different host physiologic functions, such as
      digestion, nutrition, and immunity, coexist. Although all these players were
      studied separately for decades, recently, there has been an explosion of studies 
      demonstrating the essential role for interactions between these components in gut
      function. Furthermore, new systems biology methods provide essential tools to
      study this complex system as a whole and to identify key elements that define the
      crosstalk between the gut microbiota, immunity, and metabolism. This review is
      devoted to several human diseases resulting from the disruption in this
      crosstalk, including immunodeficiency-associated and environmental enteropathies,
      celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity. We describe findings in 
      experimental models of these diseases and in germ-free animals that help us
      understand the mechanisms and test new therapeutic strategies. We also discuss
      current challenges that the field is facing and propose that a new generation of 
      antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics coupled with novel, systems
      biology-driven diagnostics will provide the basis for future personalized
      therapy.

TI  - The epidemiology of anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence
      and associated factors at diagnosis and follow-up and the impact of exclusive
      enteral nutrition.
PG  - 2411-22
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31829ed855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is poorly studied in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
      This study explored the epidemiology and associated factors of anemia at
      diagnosis, after 1 year, and during treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition
      (EEN). METHODS: Three cohorts were included: (1) a representative population of
      newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease children (n = 184); (2) patients
      currently receiving care with data available at diagnosis (n = 179) and after 1
      year (n = 139); and (3) 84 children treated with EEN. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 72% 
      were anemic. Abnormal inflammatory markers were more common in Crohn's disease
      with severe anemia (severe versus no anemia [%]: raised C-reactive protein; 89%
      versus 48%; suboptimal albumin; 97% versus 29%; P < 0.002). Anemic children with 
      Crohn's disease had shorter diagnosis delay and lower BMI than nonanemic patients
      (severe versus mild versus no anemia, median [interquartile range]; diagnosis
      delay [months]: 3 [3.9] versus 6 [10] versus 8 [18], P < 0.001; BMI z score [SD]:
      -1.4 [1.4] versus -1.3 [1.5] versus -0.2 [1.4], P = 0.003). Extensive colitis was
      associated with severe anemia in ulcerative colitis. The proportion of severely
      anemic patients decreased from 34% to 9% and mild anemia doubled at 1 year. After
      EEN, severe anemia decreased (32% to 9%; P < 0.001) and the hemoglobin
      concentration increased by 0.75 g/dL. This was observed only after 8 weeks of
      treatment. Disease improvement and low hemoglobin at EEN initiation but not
      weight gain were associated with hemoglobin improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is
      high at diagnosis and follow-up and should receive more attention from the
      clinical team; however, the focus should remain suppression of inflammatory
      process in active disease.

TI  - Increased prevalence of luminal narrowing and stricturing identified by
      enterography in pediatric Crohn's disease patients with elevated
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies.
PG  - 2146-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31829706e0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) patients with elevated granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies (GM-CSF Ab) are more likely to develop
      stricturing behavior requiring surgery. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance
      enterography (CTE or MRE) may detect luminal narrowing (LN) before stricture
      development. The objective of this study was to determine whether CD patients
      with elevated GM-CSF Ab (>/=1.6 mug/mL) have a higher prevalence of LN and
      stricturing on CTE or MRE. METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional study of 153
      pediatric patients with CD and control subjects undergoing diagnostic CTE or MRE.
      Examinations were evaluated for disease activity using a novel scoring system and
      for the presence of LN, stricture, intra-abdominal abscess, or fistulae.
      Dichotomous outcomes were compared with respect to antibody status (high or low) 
      using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression, whereas continuous outcomes
      were evaluated using unpaired t test. RESULTS: GM-CSF Ab were elevated in CD
      patients (n = 114) with a median (interquartile range) GM-CSF Ab level of 2.3
      mug/mL (0.5-6.6 mug/mL) compared with 0.6 mug/mL (0.3-1.3 mug/mL) in healthy and 
      disease control subjects (n = 39) (P = 0.001). Ileal disease location was more
      common in CD patients with high GM-CSF Ab (P < 0.001). LN increased from 39% in
      CD patients with low GM-CSF Ab to 71% in those with high levels (P = 0.004) and
      remained significantly associated with high GM-CSF Ab in a multivariate logistic 
      model, which included age, gender, small bowel location, and duration of disease.
      Stricturing prevalence on CTE or MRE examination increased from 4% in CD patients
      with low GM-CSF Ab to 19% in those with high GM-CSF Ab (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:
      Pediatric CD patients with high GM-CSF Ab levels have a higher prevalence of LN
      on CTE or MRE. Further study will be needed to determine whether medical therapy 
      will reduce progression to stricturing behavior in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The level of fecal calprotectin (FC) can predict the onset of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high accuracy and precision. We evaluated
      the cost-effectiveness of using measurements of FC to identify adults and
      children who require endoscopic confirmation of IBD. METHODS: We constructed a
      decision analytic tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of measuring FC before
      endoscopy examination with that of direct endoscopic evaluation alone. A second
      decision analytic tree was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FC
      cutoff levels of 100 mug/g vs 50 mug/g (typically used to screen for intestinal
      inflammation). The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost required to
      avoid 1 false-negative result by using FC level to diagnose new-onset IBD.
      RESULTS: In adults, FC screening saved $417/patient but delayed diagnosis for
      2.2/32 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. In children, FC screening
      saved $300/patient but delayed diagnosis for 4.8/61 patients with IBD among 100
      screened patients. If endoscopic biopsy analysis remained the standard for
      diagnosis, direct endoscopic evaluation would cost an additional $18,955 in
      adults and $6250 in children to avoid 1 false-negative result from FC screening. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of FC screening varied with
      the sensitivity of the test and the pre-test probability of IBD in adults and
      children. Pre-test probabilities for IBD of </=75% in adults and </=65% in
      children made FC screening cost-effective, but it was cost-ineffective if the
      probabilities were >/=85% and >/=78% in adults and children, respectively.
      Compared with the FC cutoff level of 100 mug/g, the cutoff level of 50 mug/g cost
      an additional $55 and $43 for adults and children, respectively, but it yielded
      2.4 and 6.1 additional accurate diagnoses of IBD per 100 screened adults and
      children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening adults and children to measure
      fecal levels of calprotectin is effective and cost-effective in identifying those
      with IBD on a per-case basis when the pre-test probability is </=75% for adults
      and </=65% for children. The utility of the test is greater for adults than
      children. Increasing the FC cutoff level to >/=50 mug/g increases diagnostic
      accuracy without substantially increasing total cost.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) induces remission in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the short-term impact of EEN 
      on bone quality and muscle mass in children with CD. METHODS: Ten newly diagnosed
      CD patients (7 male, 10.6-17.7 years of age) were assessed by peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at the forearm before starting an 8-weeks
      treatment with EEN, and after 12 and 52 weeks. No steroids or biologicals were
      applied. Trabecular and cortical bone mineral density, total bone, and muscle
      cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured by pQCT and expressed as age- and
      sex-specific z-scores; size-dependent CSAs were corrected for low height for age.
      Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied. RESULTS: Remission at week 12 was achieved in
      8 patients; 2 still had mild disease. Initially low trabecular density z-scores
      improved (+0.3; p = 0.006) at week 12; simultaneously, the increased cortical
      density z-scores normalized (-0.4; p = 0.027). The low z-score for muscle CSA
      corrected for height (median -2.5, range -3.49 to -0.97) increased within 12
      weeks (+1.0; p = 0.002) with no further improvement thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results indicate disturbed bone remodeling and severely impaired muscle mass in
      newly diagnosed CD children. Bone metabolism and muscle mass improved within 3
      months after starting EEN with no further normalization thereafter.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective and safe remission 
      induction treatment for Crohn's disease in adults. Its influence on adults'
      health-related quality of life remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
      determine the effect of EEN on health-related quality of life in adults with
      active Crohn's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients recruited were treated
      with a polymeric enteral feed that was taken orally in the daytime and via a
      self-intubated nasogastric tube at night for 4 weeks. Prospective evaluation of
      disease activity (Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI) and health-related
      quality of life (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, IBDQ) were performed
      at enrollment and after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients' feelings about EEN were
      also investigated through 2 questions. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated
      with 4-week EEN. They had a significant improvement in total IBDQ score (P <
      .001) and all IBDQ dimensions: bowel symptoms (P < .001), systemic symptoms (P < 
      .001), social function (P = .003), and emotional status (P < .001), with 11
      patients (84.6%) achieving clinical remission after treatment. In addition, 8
      patients (61.5%) expressed their willingness to receive this 4-week EEN treatment
      again to induce remission if the disease relapsed. The IBDQ correlated
      significantly with the CDAI at 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week treatment of EEN
      improves health-related quality of life significantly in adults with active
      Crohn's disease and was acceptable by most patients.

TI  - Why interleukin-10 supplementation does not work in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 3931-41
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i25.3931 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative
      colitis are chronic intestinal disorders, which are on the increase in
      "Westernised" countries. IBD can be caused by both genetic and environmental
      factors. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has been
      identified as being involved in several diseases including IBD. Studies have
      shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region reduce serum levels of IL-10 and 
      this reduction has been associated with some forms of IBD. Mouse models have
      shown promising results with IL-10 supplementation, as such IL-10 supplementation
      has been touted as being a possible alternative treatment for CD in humans.
      Clinical trials have shown that recombinant human IL-10 is safe and well
      tolerated up to a dose of 8 mug/kg. However, to date, the results of the clinical
      trials have been disappointing. Although CD activity was reduced as measured by
      the CD activity index, IL-10 supplementation did not result in significantly
      reduced remission rates or clinical improvements when compared to placebo. This
      review discusses why IL-10 supplementation is not effective in CD patients
      currently and what can be addressed to potentially make IL-10 supplementation a
      more viable treatment option in the future. Based on the current research we
      conclude that IL-10 supplementation is not a one size fits all treatment and if
      the correct population of patients is chosen then IL-10 supplementation could be 
      of benefit.

AB  - Neonatal-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) accounts for only 0.25% of
      pediatric IBD cases. The molecular pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear. Recently,
      rare Mendelian mutations have been identified in children with very early-onset
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we report compound
      heterozygous mutations in the interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA) gene in
      children with severe neonatal-onset IBD. Patient 1 had chronic diarrhea within
      the first month of life and had perianal fistulae. She was diagnosed with
      'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy' and underwent subtotal
      colectomy at the age of 24 months because of poor response to immunosuppressant
      therapy. Compound heterozygous mutations, c.[301C>T];[350G>A](p.[R101W];[R117H]),
      were discovered in IL-10RA for this patient. Patient 2 presented symptoms within 
      the first month of life and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Severe colitis
      and perianal and enteroenteric fistulae occurred repeatedly, and he underwent
      surgical management involving colectomy, colostomy, and ileostomy. We identified 
      mutations in IL-10RA, c.[272A>G];[784C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R262C]). Patient 3 had
      chronic diarrhea and a rectovaginal fistula at 3 days of life and was diagnosed
      with Crohn's disease. She underwent fistulectomy and ileostomy, but experienced
      frequent relapses. Mutations, c.[272A>G];[301C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R101W]), were found 
      in IL-10RA. This report confirms the genetic defect of IL-10RA in neonatal-onset 
      IBD including 'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy'.
