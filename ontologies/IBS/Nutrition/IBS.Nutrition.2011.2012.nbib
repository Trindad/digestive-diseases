AB  - There is an undeniable link between gastrointestinal disorders and malnutrition. 
      Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions that can 
      impact a patient's nutritional status. The nutritional consequences will depend
      on the cause of the diarrhoea as well as the location and extent of
      gastrointestinal involvement. In general, malabsorption plays a central role in
      the interaction between malnutrition and chronic diarrhoea. Malabsorption can
      result in both nutritional deficits and diarrhoea. With severe malnutrition,
      chronic diarrhoea can persist due to impaired immune function and poor mucosal
      recovery. Food intolerance and an inappropriate diet in the setting of
      malabsorption may also contribute to chronic diarrhoea. Patients may attribute
      their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific dietary intake, which can lead to
      self-imposed indiscriminate dietary restrictions. Therefore, disease-specific
      treatment in conjunction with appropriate nutritional counselling and
      intervention is recommended in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in
      patients with chronic diarrhoea. Specialized nutritional support through enteral 
      or parenteral administration may be required to treat severe caloric and
      micronutrient deficiencies. In this review, we aim to summarize the mechanism,
      diagnosis, and treatment of the nutritional consequences of chronic diarrhoea.

TI  - Does our food (environment) change our gut microbiome ('in-vironment'): a
      potential role for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Gut-directed hypnotherapy for functional abdominal pain or irritable bowel
      syndrome in children: a systematic review.
PG  - 252-7
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2012-302906 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gut directed hypnotherapy (HT) is shown to be effective in adult
      functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. We
      performed a systematic review to assess efficacy of HT in paediatric FAP/IBS
      patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Cumulative Index to
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) in children with FAP or 
      IBS, investigating efficacy of HT on the following outcomes: abdominal pain
      scores, quality of life, costs and school absenteeism. RESULTS: Three RCT
      comparing HT to a control treatment were included with sample sizes ranging from 
      22 to 52 children. We refrained from statistical pooling because of low number of
      studies and many differences in design and outcomes. Two studies examined HT
      performed by a therapist, one examined HT through self-exercises on audio CD. All
      trials showed statistically significantly greater improvement in abdominal pain
      scores among children receiving HT. One trial reported beneficial effects
      sustained after 1 year of follow-up. One trial reported statistically significant
      improvement in quality of life in the HT group. Two trials reported significant
      reductions in school absenteeism after HT. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic effects of HT
      seem superior to standard medical care in children with FAP or IBS. It remains
      difficult to quantify exact benefits. The need for more high quality research is 
      evident.

TI  - Prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in Taiwan:
      questionnaire-based survey for adults based on the Rome III criteria.
PG  - 594-600
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are a group of disorders of the
      digestive system in which the chronic or recurrent symptoms cannot be explained
      by the presence of structural or tissue abnormality. This survey used a modified 
      Rome III questionnaire on the health and nutrition status of a general population
      in Taiwan during 2005-2008. A total of 4,275 responders completed the
      questionnaire. The sample was evenly distributed for men (n=2,137) and women
      (n=2,138). The prevalence of FGID was 26.2%. Unspecified functional bowel
      disorder was the most prevalent (8.9%). The second was functional dyspepsia
      (5.3%), and the third were irritable bowel syndrome (4.4%) and functional
      constipation (4.4%). Women had a greater prevalence than males (33.2% compared to
      22.4%, p<0.05) with regards to total FGID. Most categories of FGID were
      significantly prominent in women, except functional diarrhea. The FGID groups
      took fewer servings of vegetables and fruits than the non-FGID group each day
      (vegetables 2.51 vs 2.70, p<0.001; fruits 0.82 vs 0.91, p<0.001). Smoking,
      alcohol consumption, and betel nut chewing had no significant impaction on
      prevalence of FGID. The mean BSRS (brief-symptom rating scale) for screening
      depression and suicide ideation was higher in the FGID group (2.86 vs 1.63,
      p<0.001). In conclusion, FGID diagnosed with Rome III criteria are not uncommon
      in Taiwan's general population. Subjects who met the Rome III criteria for FGID
      in Taiwan were younger, had less vegetables and fruits intake, higher BSRS scores
      and were of greater female predominance.

TI  - Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity
      and disease.
PG  - 1095-119
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside
      in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the
      human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must
      maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive
      to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory
      processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence
      suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence
      susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
      Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased
      incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early
      childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an
      alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant
      immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced
      dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will
      be discussed.

TI  - Increased proton pump inhibitor and NSAID exposure in irritable bowel syndrome:
      results from a case-control study.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) seen by a
      gastroenterologist often utilize medications that may alter intestinal
      homeostasis. The question arises whether exposure to these drugs is associated
      with the development of IBS symptoms. Aim of this study was therefore to assess
      the use of PPIs and NSAIDs in patients with IBS versus controls. METHODS: Cases
      of IBS from the last 5 years were reviewed. All patients having had at least one 
      prescription for a particular drug (PPIs, NSAIDs, SSRIs, diuretics, ACE
      inhibitors) in the 6 months prior to the time of initial symptom onset were
      considered exposed. The control group consisted of individuals randomly selected 
      from the general population. RESULTS: 287 cases of IBS were retrieved for
      analysis together with 287 age and sex-matched controls. Exposure to PPIs and
      NSAIDs was significantly higher in IBS patients, whereas no association between
      ACE inhibitor use and IBS was found. PPIs were not significantly associated when 
      excluding patients with gastrointestinal reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. 
      Exposure to SSRIs was also positively associated with IBS, but only when patients
      with psychiatric comorbidity were included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Medications that may alter intestinal homeostasis such as NSAIDs and PPIs were
      more frequently used in IBS patients compared to controls. This association might
      be relevant for everyday clinical practice, but it is remains to be elucidated
      whether this association is of etiological nature.

TI  - Nutrient intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with the
      general population.
PG  - 23-30.e1
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS.
      Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to
      the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups
      based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate 
      if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187
      IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food
      registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control 
      group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic
      Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was 
      similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations.
      Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from
      macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended
      to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher
      daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well
      as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no
      association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food
      items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large
      extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency
      toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy
      products in IBS patients.

AB  - Hygienic and dietology estimation of cereal breakfast (oat muesli and crispbread)
      were carried out on 137 irritable colon syndrome (SRK) patients with functional
      chronic constipation. It is established that inclusion of cereal breakfast in a
      diet of such patients positively influences on motor-evacuation function of
      digestive tract and promotes improvement of indicators of carbohydrate and lipid 
      metabolism. It is important for patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes.
      Positive improvements of research allow making a cereal breakfast use
      recommendations: muesli in number of 50 g/days (with milk or kefir), crispbread
      and crunchy snacks in number of 100 g/days in SRK patients with functional
      chronic constipation dietary nutrition.

TI  - Parental report of abdominal pain and abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders from a community survey.
PG  - 707-10
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182662401 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in 
      children. Abdominal pain (AP) is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom in
      children. The severity of AP drives medical consultations and quality of life in 
      adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thirty-eight percent of 8- to
      15-year-old schoolchildren report AP weekly with 24% of those children reporting 
      persistence of AP >8 weeks. Despite the high prevalence of AP, only 2% of school 
      children seek medical attention for AP. Lack of parental knowledge on their
      child's symptoms may constitute one of the factors affecting the low ratio of
      consultation in children reporting AP. The aim was to assess parental reports of 
      AP symptoms in a population of healthy community children. METHODS: Data of 5
      studies with identical methodology to assess GI symptoms in children with celiac 
      disease (CD), cow's milk allergy (CMA), pyloric stenosis (PS), Henoch-Schonlein
      purpura (HSP), and stem cell transplant (SC) and their healthy siblings were
      reviewed: a phone questionnaire on GI symptoms and Pediatric Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire (QPGS-RIII). Inclusion criteria were
      healthy children 4 to 18 years of age with a sibling previously diagnosed with
      CD, CMA, PS, HSP, or SC. RESULTS: Data on 246 healthy children, mean age (9.8
      years, range 3-24, 112 girls) were obtained. Parents reported presence of AP in
      the last 8 weeks before the telephone contact in 20 (8.1%) children (age range
      4-18 years, 11 girls). There was no significant difference in AP prevalence
      between boys and girls (P = 0.64). Six children (2.4%) met QPGS-RIII diagnostic
      criteria for FGIDs: 3 functional abdominal pain (FAP) and 3 IBS. CONCLUSIONS: AP 
      was common in community children. FAP was the most common FGID among healthy
      community children. The prevalence of AP by parental report is lower than the
      previously published prevalence of AP reported by children. Lack of awareness of 
      children's symptoms may play a role in the low ratio of consultation for AP in
      symptomatic children. Future prospective studies should confirm our findings and 
      investigate the factors influencing the medical consultation decision including
      parental awareness of children's symptoms.

PG  - 1510-8
LID - 10.3945/jn.112.159285 [doi]
AB  - Preliminary studies indicate that dietary restriction of fermentable short-chain 
      carbohydrates improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Prebiotic
      fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides stimulate colonic
      bifidobacteria. However, the effect of restricting fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has never been examined.
      This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of fermentable 
      carbohydrate restriction on luminal microbiota, SCFA, and GI symptoms in patients
      with IBS. Patients with IBS were randomized to the intervention diet or habitual 
      diet for 4 wk. The incidence and severity of symptoms and stool output were
      recorded for 7 d at baseline and follow-up. A stool sample was collected and
      analyzed for bacterial groups using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Of 41
      patients randomized, 6 were withdrawn. At follow-up, there was lower intake of
      total short-chain fermentable carbohydrates in the intervention group compared
      with controls (P = 0.001). The total luminal bacteria at follow-up did not differ
      between groups; however, there were lower concentrations (P < 0.001) and
      proportions (P < 0.001) of bifidobacteria in the intervention group compared with
      controls when adjusted for baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, more
      patients in the intervention group reported adequate control of symptoms (13/19, 
      68%) compared with controls (5/22, 23%; P = 0.005). This randomized controlled
      trial demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal
      bifidobacteria after 4 wk of fermentable carbohydrate restriction. Although the
      intervention was effective in managing IBS symptoms, the implications of its
      effect on the GI microbiota are still to be determined.

TI  - Effects of linseeds on the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: a pilot
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 435-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01263.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Manipulation of dietary fibre intake represents a longstanding
      treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly for
      those with constipation. Linseeds are often recommended by both clinicians and
      dietitians as a source of dietary fibre to alleviate symptoms. Recent guidance on
      the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) advises that linseeds may reduce
      wind and bloating, although there is limited clinical evidence to support this
      recommendation. The present pilot study aimed to compare the clinical
      effectiveness of: (i) whole linseeds versus ground linseeds; (ii) whole linseeds 
      versus no linseeds; and (iii) ground linseeds versus no linseeds in the
      management of IBS symptoms. METHODS: In an open randomised controlled trial,
      subjects with IBS (n = 40) were allocated to one of three intervention groups:
      two tablespoons of whole linseeds per day (n = 14), two tablespoons of ground
      linseeds per day (n = 13) and no linseeds as controls (n = 13). Symptom severity 
      (primary outcome) and bowel habit were assessed before and after a 4-week
      intervention and statistical differences between the groups were compared.
      RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the present study. Between-group analysis 
      comparing the improvement in symptom severity did not reach statistical
      significance for whole linseeds (n = 11) versus ground linseeds (n = 11; P =
      0.62), whole linseeds versus controls (n = 9; P = 0.12) and ground linseeds
      versus controls (P = 0.10). There were no significant changes in stool frequency 
      or stool consistency for any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linseeds may be useful
      in relief of IBS symptoms. Further research is needed to detect clear differences
      between the effects of whole and ground linseeds.

TI  - Marine bioactives: pharmacological properties and potential applications against 
      inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 812-33
LID - 10.3390/md10040812 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in
      inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis,
      diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease,
      Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the
      past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually
      the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may
      lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation
      of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an
      influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of
      the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is
      not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been
      implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the
      antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of
      oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing
      antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic
      substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related
      oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped
      reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for
      exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such 
      as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of
      health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic
      and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining
      attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory
      degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published
      studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of
      many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Case-control study of disturbed eating behaviors and related psychographic
      characteristics in young adults with and without diet-related chronic health
      conditions.
PG  - 207-13
LID - 10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.02.003 [doi]
AB  - Young adults with diet-related chronic health conditions (DRCHCs; i.e., type 1
      diabetes, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable
      bowel syndrome) face challenges complying with dietary restrictions required to
      effectively manage their health condition. These restrictions could put them at
      risk for disturbed eating. The purpose of this study was to determine if young
      adults with and without DRCHCs differed with regard to disturbed eating behaviors
      and related psychographics characteristics (i.e., body image attributes, mental
      disorders, intrapersonal characteristics and sociocultural environment [i.e.,
      media and family]). Each DRCHC participant (cases=166) was matched to 4 healthy
      participants (controls=664) based on gender and BMI (+/-0.50 BMI units).
      Conditional logistic regression analyses indicate cases were twice as likely to
      have been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with an eating disorder (p=0.08,
      OR=1.99, CI(90) [1.03-3.83]). Cases were significantly more likely to use
      Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors to manage their weight, i.e., excessive
      exercise (p=0.04, OR=1.41, CI(95) [1.02-1.94]) and misuse medication (p=0.04,
      OR=1.14, CI(95) [1.00-1.29]) than controls. Depression and anxiety were
      significantly higher, and health status was significantly poorer in cases
      compared with controls. DRCHC participants were less likely to report feeling
      body image pressures from the media, placed a greater value on their health, used
      social diversion, and recalled a greater emphasis being placed on their mothers' 
      weights and mealtimes being less structured than control participants. Findings
      indicate that nutrition and other healthcare professionals should incorporate
      screening DRCHC patients for disturbed eating behaviors and eating disorders in
      their standards of care.

PG  - 283-9
LID - 10.1007/s11894-012-0268-2 [doi]
AB  - Complimentary alternative treatment regimens are widely used in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), but the evidence supporting their use varies. For psychological
      treatment options, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness,
      gut-directed hypnotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy, the evidence supporting
      their use in IBS patients is strong, but the availability limits their use in
      clinical practice. Dietary interventions are commonly included in the management 
      of IBS patients, but these are primarily based on studies assessing physiological
      function in relation to dietary components, and to a lesser degree upon research 
      examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of IBS.
      Several probiotic products improve a range of symptoms in IBS patients. Physical 
      activity is of benefit for health in general and recent data implicates its
      usefulness also for IBS patients. Acupuncture does not seem to have an effect
      beyond placebo in IBS. A beneficial effect of some herbal treatments has been
      reported.

      assess visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - G141-54
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00060.2012 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, 
      characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort in combination with
      disturbed bowel habits in the absence of identifiable organic cause. Visceral
      hypersensitivity has emerged as a key hypothesis in explaining the painful
      symptoms in IBS and has been proposed as a "biological hallmark" for the
      condition. Current techniques of assessing visceral perception include the
      computerized barostat using rectal distensions, registering responses induced by 
      sensory stimuli including the flexor reflex and cerebral evoked potentials, as
      well as brain imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
      and positron emission tomography. These methods have provided further insight
      into alterations in pain processing in IBS, although the most optimal method and 
      condition remain to be established. In an attempt to give an overview of these
      methods, a literature search in the electronic databases PubMed and MEDLINE was
      executed using the search terms "assessment of visceral pain/visceral
      nociception/visceral hypersensitivity" and "irritable bowel syndrome." Both
      original articles and review articles were considered for data extraction. This
      review aims to discuss currently used modalities in assessing visceral
      perception, along with advantages and limitations, and aims also to define future
      directions for methodological aspects in visceral pain research. Although novel
      paradigms such as brain imaging and neurophysiological recordings have been
      introduced in the study of visceral pain, confirmative studies are warranted to
      establish their robustness and clinical relevance. Therefore, subjective verbal
      reporting following rectal distension currently remains the best-validated
      technique in assessing visceral perception in IBS.

TI  - The gut microbiota in the metagenomics era: sometimes a friend, sometimes a foe.
PG  - 134-40
AB  - The normal intestinal microflora (microbiota) represents a complex, dynamic, and 
      diverse collection of microorganisms, which usually inhabit the gastrointestinal 
      tract. Normally, between this flora and the human host a mutually beneficial
      long-term symbiotic relationship is established, where the host contributes
      essential nutrients necessary for the survival of the microbiota and the latter
      fulfils multiple roles in host nutrition and development. Several achievements
      have recently converged to renew interest in studying the normal gut microbiota: 
      the development of molecular methods of studying the microbial communities, the
      improved understanding of host-microbe interactions in health and disease, and
      the potential for therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota. We present recent
      data concerning the molecular technologies of studying the microbiota and new
      findings regarding the composition of the normal flora. We underline the
      beneficial activities of the gut flora on the human host. We emphasize the recent
      findings in the alterations of the microbiota in various medical conditions
      (celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, colorectal cancer, allergic
      disorders, and especially inflammatory bowel diseases). The results of these new 
      studies suggest that changes of the microbiota could be linked to the
      etiopathogenesis of these diseases. These outstanding findings could be used for 
      further diagnostic tools and/or therapy.

PG  - 1444-54

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder
      characterized by abdominal pain related to defecation with a change in bowel
      habit. Patients with IBS often exhibit increased visceral sensitivity, which can 
      be tested clinically by rectal balloon distension procedures. This paper aims to 
      give an overview of mechanisms involved in visceral hypersensitivity in IBS by
      reviewing recent literature. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: A literature search in
      the electronic databases Pubmed and MEDLINE was executed using the search terms
      'visceral pain' or 'visceral nociception' or 'visceral hypersensitivity' and
      'irritable bowel syndrome.' Both original articles and review articles were
      considered for data extraction. RESULTS: Recent advances in molecular
      neurophysiology provide knowledge to better understand the underlying mechanism
      in pain generation in the human gut, in particular, in IBS patients.
      Sensitization of peripheral nociceptive afferents, more specifically
      high-threshold afferents, has been proposed as one of the principle mechanism in 
      the development of visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, central
      mechanisms also play an important role. In terms of clinical testing of visceral 
      perception, considerable discrepancies remain, however, across different centres.
      CONCLUSION: Alterations in the modulatory balance of pro- and antinociceptive
      central processing of noxious peripheral input may serve as in integrative
      hypothesis for explaining visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Nevertheless, it
      remains troublesome to estimate the contribution of central and peripheral
      factors in visceral hypersensitivity, posing a challenge in determining effective
      therapeutic entities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional
      gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management
      strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects
      of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based
      guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet 
      and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These
      included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP),
      fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or
      elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant
      studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic
      database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and
      Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and
      research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically 
      appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of
      treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary
      management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy 
      eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP.
      Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP,
      fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical
      diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for
      adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS:
      These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful 
      dietary management of IBS.

TI  - The human microbiome and its potential importance to pediatrics.
PG  - 950-60
LID - 10.1542/peds.2011-2736 [doi]
AB  - The human body is home to more than 1 trillion microbes, with the
      gastrointestinal tract alone harboring a diverse array of commensal microbes that
      are believed to contribute to host nutrition, developmental regulation of
      intestinal angiogenesis, protection from pathogens, and development of the immune
      response. Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies and metagenomic
      analysis are providing a broader understanding of these resident microbes and
      highlighting differences between healthy and disease states. The aim of this
      review is to provide a detailed summary of current pediatric microbiome studies
      in the literature, in addition to highlighting recent findings and advancements
      in studies of the adult microbiome. This review also seeks to elucidate the
      development of, and factors that could lead to changes in, the composition and
      function of the human microbiome.

TI  - Alternative procedure to shorten rectal barostat procedure for the assessment of 
      rectal compliance and visceral perception: a feasibility study.
PG  - 896-903
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0543-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Barostat methodology is widely used for assessing visceral
      perception. Different barostat protocols are described with respect to the
      measurement of rectal compliance and visceral perception. The choice of protocols
      affects the duration, which is normally 60-90 min, and accuracy of the procedure.
      This study aimed to shorten the procedure by using the semi-random distension
      protocol for both compliance and visceral perception measurement and a correction
      based on rectal capacity (RC) instead of minimal distension pressure (MDP).
      METHODS: Twelve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (7 females) and 11
      healthy controls (8 females) underwent a barostat procedure. Compliance was
      determined during both a staircase distension and a semi-random protocol.
      Visceral perception data were compared as a function of pressure or relative
      volume, corrected for MDP or RC, respectively. RESULTS: Compliance measurement
      using the semi-random protocol instead of the staircase distension protocol
      resulted in an overestimation in healthy volunteers, but not in IBS patients. The
      overall conclusion that IBS patients had a lower compliance compared to controls 
      was not different between protocols. Data presentation of the visceral perception
      scores as a function of corrected volume instead of pressures corrected for MDP
      did not alter the conclusion that sensation scores in IBS patients were higher as
      compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that barostat
      procedures may be shortened by approximately 20 min, without losing the ability
      to discriminate between healthy controls and IBS patients. A correction for RC
      instead of MDP may improve the accuracy of the procedure.

TI  - Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity: when gluten free is not a 
      fad.
PG  - 68S-75S
LID - 10.1177/0148607111426276 [doi]
AB  - As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health
      practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those
      patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition
      therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in
      symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit
      from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, 
      and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where
      patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of
      symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include
      dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic
      diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients
      and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these
      conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can
      experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the
      development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy 
      and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these
      complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive
      conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality,
      large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in
      this evolving field.

TI  - Diet and its role in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and
      comorbid conditions.
PG  - 1584-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10860.x [doi]
AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Nearly 90% of patients 
      with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to
      a wide variety of dietary comestibles. Current questionnaire-based literature
      suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, 
      tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate
      symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve
      symptoms. At present we recommend employing a controlled method to determine
      dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, in order to identify
      sensitivities while at the same time maintain optimal nutritional intake. We
      review current literature with regard to diet's effect upon IC/BPS and common
      comorbidities (irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, 
      neuropathic pain, vulvodynia, and headache) with a focus upon questionnaire-based
      investigations. We discuss the pathologic mechanisms that may link diet and
      IC/BPS related-pain, concentrating upon specific comestibles such as acidic
      foods, foods high in potassium, caffeine, and alcohol. Up to 90% of patients with
      interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a
      wide variety of comestibles. Pathological mechanisms suggested to be responsible 
      for the relationship between dietary intake and symptom exacerbation include
      peripheral and/or central neural upregulation, bladder epithelial dysfunction,
      and organ 'cross-talk', amongst others. Current questionnaire-based data suggests
      that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea,
      carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, 
      while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms.
      Specific comestible sensitivities varied between patients and may have been
      influenced by comorbid conditions. This suggests that a controlled method to
      determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, may play an
      important role in patient management.

TI  - Nonruminant Nutrition Symposium: Involvement of gut neural and endocrine systems 
      in pathological disorders of the digestive tract.
PG  - 1203-12
LID - 10.2527/jas.2011-4825 [doi]
AB  - The functioning of the gastrointestinal tract is under the control of the most
      extensive system of peripheral neurons in the body, the enteric nervous system,
      and the largest endocrine system of the body, the GEP endocrine system. The
      enteric nervous system in large mammals contains 500 million neurons, and the GEP
      endocrine system produces more than 30 hormones. Numerous enteric neuropathies
      affecting both humans and animals have been described and digestive disorders
      affect commercially important species, such as horses and cattle. The most severe
      enteric neuropathies (e.g., lethal white syndrome in horses or Hirschsprung's
      disease in humans) can be fatal. Also, horses with ileus or other digestive
      disorders are commonly euthanized. In this review we discuss examples of enteric 
      neuropathies that affect agricultural animals and humans: prion disease,
      postoperative ileus, distal enteric aganglionosis, and infective diarrhea.
      Enteric neurons and glia are a location of prion proteins and are involved in
      transmission of the infection from gut to brain and brain to gut. Postoperative
      ileus is a complex disorder involving the local inhibitory effects of sympathetic
      nervous system activation and the release of opioids, presumably from enteric
      neurons. Intestinal inflammation, especially of the external muscle that includes
      enteric ganglia, also occurs in ileus. Congenital distal bowel aganglionosis,
      responsible for lethal white syndrome in horses, Hirschsprung's disease in
      humans, and similar conditions in mice and rats, is a fatal condition if
      untreated. Mutations of the same genes can cause the condition in each of these
      species. The only effective current treatment is surgical removal of the
      aganglionic bowel. Infectious diarrheas involve activation of enteric
      secretomotor neurons by pathogens and the toxins they produce, which causes
      substantial fluid loss. Strategies to target enteric neurons in the treatment of 
      secretory diarrheas have not been developed. Disorders of enteroendocrine cells, 
      other than GEP endocrine tumors, are less well documented. However, evidence for 
      the involvement of gut endocrine cells in a subset of patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome, and in the symptomology of celiac disease, has been demonstrated.
      Further investigation of the involvement of enteric neural and endocrine
      signaling systems in digestive disorders, especially in agricultural and
      companion animals, may lead to diagnostic and therapeutic advances.

AB  - The synbiotic concept was first introduced, along with prebiotics, as "mixtures
      of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the
      survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the
      gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by
      activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting
      bacteria, thus improving host welfare" (Gibson & Roberfroid 1995). Since, there
      have been many in vitro and in vivo studies focusing on the application of
      prebiotics, firstly in health and gradually in disease states. Only recently have
      studies on synbiotics started to emerge with the main focus being on applications
      against disease. Here, we review the current literature, with the main focus on
      in vivo human studies.

TI  - Probiotics--an alternative treatment for various diseases.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - Modulating the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract through probiotics is an 
      alternative to the conventional treatment of various diseases, based on synthetic
      drugs. The lifestyle, nutrition and stress of the present modern society could be
      among the factors responsible for modifications in the intestinal microbiota,
      correlated with specific diseases. The present study describes the positive
      effects of probiotics use, with special reference to the yeasts use in several
      frequently encountered diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia, the irritable
      bowel syndrome, gastritis and several uro-genital disorders.

TI  - Distinct microbial populations exist in the mucosa-associated microbiota of
      sub-groups of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 31-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence to support a role for the
      gastrointestinal microbiota in the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Given the evidence of an inflammatory component to IBS, the mucosa-associated
      microbiota potentially play a key role in its pathogenesis. The objectives were
      to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota between patients with diarrhea
      predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) and controls using 
      fluorescent in situ hybridization and to correlate specific bacteria groups with 
      individual IBS symptoms. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with IBS (27 IBS-D and 20 
      IBS-C) and 26 healthy controls were recruited to the study. Snap-frozen rectal
      biopsies were taken at colonoscopy and bacterial quantification performed by
      hybridizing frozen sections with bacterial-group specific oligonucleotide probes.
      KEY RESULTS: Patients with IBS had significantly greater numbers of total
      mucosa-associated bacteria per mm of rectal epithelium than controls [median 218 
      (IQR - 209) vs 128 (121) P = 0.007], and this was chiefly comprised of
      bacteroides IBS [69 (67) vs 14 (41) P = 0.001] and Eubacterium
      rectale-Clostridium coccoides [52 (58) vs 25 (35) P = 0.03]. Analysis of IBS
      sub-groups demonstrated that bifidobacteria were lower in the IBS-D group than in
      the IBS-C group and controls [24 (32) vs 54 (88) vs 32 (35) P = 0.011]. Finally, 
      amongst patients with IBS, the maximum number of stools per day negatively
      correlated with the number of mucosa-associated bifidobacteria (P < 0.001) and
      lactobacilli (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The mucosa-associated
      microbiota in patients with IBS is significantly different from healthy controls 
      with increases in bacteroides and clostridia and a reduction in bifidobacteria in
      patients with IBS-D.

TI  - Enterococci as probiotics and their implications in food safety.
PG  - 125-40
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.08.014 [doi]
AB  - Enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and they are of importance
      in foods due to their involvement in food spoilage and fermentations, as well as 
      their utilisation as probiotics in humans and slaughter animals. However, they
      are also important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and 
      other infections. Some strains are resistant to many antibiotics and possess
      virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, pili and haemolysin. The role of
      enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or
      as probiotics. Studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal
      strains isolated from food showed that some can harbour virulence traits, but it 
      is also thought that virulence is not the result of the presence of specific
      virulence determinants alone, but is rather a more intricate process. Specific
      genetic lineages of hospital-adapted strains have emerged, such as E. faecium
      clonal complex (CC) 17 and E. faecalis CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40, which are high
      risk enterococcal clonal complexes. These are characterised by the presence of
      antibiotic resistance determinants and/or virulence factors, often located on
      pathogenicity islands or plasmids. Mobile genetic elements thus are considered to
      play a major role in the establishment of problematic lineages. Although
      enterococci occur in high numbers in certain types of fermented cheeses and
      sausages, they are not deliberately added as starter cultures. Some E. faecium
      and E. faecalis strains are used as probiotics and are ingested in high numbers, 
      generally in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. Such probiotics are
      administered to treat diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea or irritable
      bowel syndrome, to lower cholesterol levels or to improve host immunity. In
      animals, enterococcal probiotics are mainly used to treat or prevent diarrhoea,
      for immune stimulation or to improve growth. From a food microbiological point of
      view, the safety of the bacteria used as probiotics must be assured, and data on 
      the major strains in use so far indicate that they are safe. The advantage of use
      of probiotics in slaughter animals, from a food microbiological point of view,
      lies in the reduction of zoonotic pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract of
      animals which prevents the transmission of these pathogens via food. The use of
      enterococcal probiotics should, in view of the development of problematic
      lineages and the potential for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract of
      both humans and animals, be carefully monitored, and the advantages of using
      these and new strains should be considered in a well contemplated risk/benefit
      analysis.

      of recent clinical trials and systematic reviews.
PG  - 581-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32834b8082 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the
      gastrointestinal tract, about which there has been considerable recent research. 
      The aim of this article is to briefly review the aspects of IBS pathogenesis that
      involve the gastrointestinal microbiota, and then to critically appraise the
      recent and emerging evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in its
      management. RECENT FINDINGS: The increased risk of developing IBS following
      gastroenteritis and the co-existence of dysbiosis, elevated luminal gas
      production and immune activation, indicate that the gastrointestinal microbiota
      may be a therapeutic target in IBS. Most systematic reviews indicate that
      probiotics have a beneficial impact on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and
      flatulence. However, recent trials indicate that different probiotics can
      improve, have no effect, or even worsen symptoms, confirming that benefits are
      likely to be strain and symptom-specific. There are no recent clinical trials of 
      prebiotics in IBS, although previous studies indicate potential benefit at lower 
      doses. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the
      management of IBS; however, the benefits are likely to be strain-specific.
      Preliminary studies suggest low doses of prebiotics may improve symptoms of IBS, 
      although further robust clinical trials are required.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the long-term efficacy of the
      tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs amitriptyline or imipramine in treating
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in pediatric patients. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children with a diagnosis of
      irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and functional abdominal pain
      diagnosed on the basis of the Rome III criteria was performed. Charts were
      analyzed for response to the medication and the duration of the response.
      RESULTS: A total of 98 patients took a TCA for an FGID. Of the 98 patients, 77
      patients (78.6%) responded to the treatment for an average of 10.73 (range 1-45) 
      months. CONCLUSIONS: TCAs are effective in treating FGIDs in pediatric patients
      for a long duration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal
      disorder comprising abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and disordered
      defecation. The prevalence of IBS is 10-15% in the general population. This study
      investigated the prevalence of IBS and the relationship between IBS and stress,
      lifestyle, and dietary habits among nursing and medical school students. METHODS:
      A blank self-administrated questionnaire was used to survey 2,639 students
      studying nursing or medicine. This questionnaire asked about IBS symptoms,
      lifestyle, dietary intake, life events, anxiety, and depression. The
      questionnaires were collected from 2,365 students (89.6%) and the responses of
      1,768 students (74.8%) were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 35.5% as
      a whole, 25.2% in males and 41.5% in females. Significantly higher stress scores 
      (anxiety and depression) and life events were found in the IBS group than in the 
      non-IBS group. Sleep disorders and the time spent sitting were also higher in
      males with IBS. In the IBS group, females ate less fish, fruit, milk, and
      green-yellow vegetables, and more processed food products than the non-IBS group 
      (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.032, p = 0.037, p < 0.001). The rates of missed
      meals and irregular mealtimes were significantly higher in females in the IBS
      group (p = 0.001, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS was higher among
      nursing and medical students, and further interventional studies are needed to
      improve IBS symptoms.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the importance of nutrition in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to improve. With increasing evidence
      or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of
      nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment 
      of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel
      syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized
      in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because
      of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against
      new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now
      beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin
      D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory
      effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a
      randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and
      micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of
      all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding
      of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more
      effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like
      immune-suppressants should be explored.

      intestine: implications for treatment.

AB  - There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment 
      we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive
      tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol,
      microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including
      obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases 
      of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the
      microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this
      is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The
      luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external
      factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's
      esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and
      colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel 
      diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel
      syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of
      particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are
      immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind
      disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic
      esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition
      mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined,
      providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free
      diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that 
      environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for
      its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in
      all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by
      modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to
      gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading
      ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or
      modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other
      novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that 
      lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the
      immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting 
      tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell
      responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease
      reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune
      response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and
      small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as
      ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much 
      more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and
      their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment
      strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.

PG  - 1671-1677

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal
      disorder, affecting more than 10% of the general population worldwide. Although a
      genetic component is suspected, unambiguous susceptibility genes have so far not 
      been identified. This study tested the hypothesis that genes contributing to
      epithelial barrier integrity, control of mucosal immune responses and
      interactions with bacteria in the gut are associated with IBS. METHODS: Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to top signals of association with 
      Crohn's disease at 30 known susceptibility loci were tested for their effect on
      IBS risk in 1992 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts from
      Sweden and the USA. Association tests included a conservative Bonferroni
      correction for multiple comparisons, and were also performed on specific
      subgroups of patients characterised by constipation (IBS-C), diarrhoea (IBS-D) or
      alternating constipation and diarrhoea (IBS-A). RESULTS: The Crohn's disease risk
      allele rs4263839 G in the TNFSF15 gene was significantly associated with an
      increased risk of both IBS (p=2.2x10(-5); OR 1.37) and more pronouncedly, IBS-C
      (p=8.7x10(-7); OR 1.79) in the entire sample. Similar associations and risk
      effects of the same magnitude were observed in the two cohorts analysed
      separately. A correlation between rs4263839 genotype and TNFSF15 mRNA expression 
      was detected both in peripheral blood and in rectal mucosal biopsies from healthy
      individuals (combined p=0.0033). CONCLUSIONS: TNFSF15 is a susceptibility gene
      for IBS and IBS constipation. As TL1A, the protein encoded by TNFSF15,
      contributes to the modulation of inflammatory responses, the results support a
      role of immune activation in IBS.

TI  - Low intake of vitamin B6 is associated with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
PG  - 356-61

AB  - Most subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience an association
      between symptoms and food consumption. Although dietary intake has been the focus
      of previous research, attention to specific nutrients has been rare. We
      hypothesized that there is an association between the severity of IBS symptoms
      and the intake of specific food groups and specific nutrients. In this
      cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the
      Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every
      evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of 
      food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period.
      Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily
      IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B(6) was the only
      component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score.
      The median daily intake of vitamin B(6) was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the
      recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day
      or more, respectively. A high symptom score was associated with low vitamin B(6) 
      intake (adjusted R(2) = 0.583; beta = -4.431; 95% confidence interval, -6.386 to 
      -2.476; P = 0.0002). A significant inverse association between intake of vitamin 
      B(6) and severity of IBS symptoms might have clinical implications.

TI  - Comparison of symptom response following advice for a diet low in fermentable
      carbohydrates (FODMAPs) versus standard dietary advice in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 487-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2011.01162.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that the consumption of fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may result
      in symptoms in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The present
      study aimed to determine whether a low FODMAP diet is effective for symptom
      control in patients with IBS and to compare its effects with those of standard
      dietary advice based on the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical
      Excellence (NICE) guidelines. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBS who attended
      a follow-up dietetic outpatient visit for dietary management of their symptoms
      were included. Questionnaires were completed for patients who received standard
      (n = 39) or low FODMAP dietary advice (n = 43). Data were recorded on symptom
      change and comparisons were made between groups. RESULTS: In total, more patients
      in the low FODMAP group reported satisfaction with their symptom response (76%)
      compared to the standard group (54%, P = 0.038). Composite symptom score data
      showed better overall symptom response in the low FODMAP group (86%) compared to 
      the standard group (49%, P < 0.001). Significantly more patients in the low
      FODMAP group compared to the standard group reported improvements in bloating
      (low FODMAP 82% versus standard 49%, P = 0.002), abdominal pain (low FODMAP 85%
      versus standard 61%, P = 0.023) and flatulence (low FODMAP 87% versus standard
      50%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet appears to be more effective than
      standard dietary advice for symptom control in IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that children who had pyloric stenosis are at greater
      risk for developing chronic abdominal pain because this cohort combines various
      risk factors: an early stressful event, gastric surgery, and perioperative
      nasogastric tube placement in most cases. STUDY DESIGN: This was a case control
      study of all children diagnosed with pyloric stenosis during infancy (cases)
      between January 1, 2000, and June 31, 2005, at Children's Memorial Hospital,
      Chicago. Because of their similar genetic and socioeconomic backgrounds, siblings
      aged 4 to 20 years without a history of pyloric stenosis were selected as
      controls. Parents of children with symptoms completed the parental form of the
      Pediatric GI Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire for both cases and controls.
      The primary outcome was the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain, and the
      secondary outcome was the presence of pain-associated functional gastrointestinal
      disorder (FGID), in accordance with Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Cases (n = 100;
      mean age, 7.49 +/- 1.43 years; 29 girls) and controls (n = 91; mean age, 9.20 +/-
      4.19 years; 29 girls) participated in the study. Mean time to follow-up was 7.2
      +/- 1.6 years. Chronic abdominal pain was significantly more common in cases than
      in controls (20/80 [25%] vs 5/91 [5.8%]; OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.5-12; P = .0045).
      Seven out of 20 subjects (35%) met the Rome III criteria for diagnosis of a
      pain-associated FGID (3 with irritable bowel syndrome, 2 with functional
      dyspepsia, and 2 with functional abdominal pain), and 1 patient in the control
      group (with irritable bowel syndrome) met these criteria (OR, 6.8; 95% CI,
      0.82-56; P = .043). CONCLUSION: We have described a new model to study early life
      events in infants. Our findings suggest that the presence of pyloric stenosis in 
      infancy and factors involved in its perioperative care represent risk factors in 
      the development of chronic abdominal pain in children at long-term follow-up.
      This study provides important data to sustain the multifactorial theoretical
      construct of pain-associated FGID and underscores the importance of early life
      events in the development of chronic abdominal pain in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered as a risk factor for many functional digestive 
      disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and the
      association of functional digestive symptoms affecting the upper and the lower
      digestive tract in patients eligible for bariatric surgery. METHODS: Before
      surgery, 120 consecutive patients with normal upper endoscopy (7.5% males, mean
      BMI 44 +/- 6 m/kg(2)) have filled a standard questionnaire in order to evaluate
      the presence of depressive symptoms and functional digestive disorders according 
      to the Rome criteria. The major symptoms (esophageal, gastroduodenal, anorectal, 
      and abdominal pain) were coded as dichotomous variables. Data analysis was
      performed using multivariate logistic regression with a backwards selection
      procedure adjusted only for the variables that were significant in univariate
      analysis (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Functional symptoms were present in 89% of the
      subjects (2.5 functional digestive symptoms/subject). Depression symptoms were
      found in 43% of the patients. Esophageal symptoms were independent predictors for
      the presence of gastric, bowel, and anorectal symptoms. Functional abdominal pain
      and bowel symptoms were present, respectively, in 19% and 84% of the patients.
      Approximately half of the patients have specific functional bowel disorders
      (28.6% constipation, 18% irritable bowel syndrome, 18% diarrhea, 1% bloating) and
      35.7% have non-specific bowel disorders. Anorectal symptoms were found in 40% of 
      the patients: difficult defecation in 32% and fecal incontinence in 9.8% of the
      patients. Depression was an independent predictor for anorectal symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the high prevalence of functional bowel symptoms in
      patients complaining of morbid obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Food-related symptoms are commonly described by patients with
      functional bowel disorders, but dietary change as an evidence-based therapy has
      not been part of routine management strategies. This reviews aims to discuss
      strategies commonly applied. METHOD: Published literature was reviewed. RESULTS: 
      Traditional approaches involve elimination diets followed by placebo-controlled
      reintroduction of specific foods, which is tedious at best and not applied in
      routine practice. Pathogenically-based approaches include determining what food
      components are inducing food hypersensitivity responses using specific
      biomarkers, but this is probably applicable to a small proportion of patients
      only and has met with only limited success. Food bioactive chemicals, such as
      salicylates, have been targeted, but there is a paucity of quality evidence for
      or against this approach. In contrast, targeting poorly absorbed dietary
      components that might induce luminal distension via osmotic effects and rapid
      fermentation (FODMAPs) has been successful and the efficacy of the
      dietitian-delivered low FODMAP diet is now supported by high quality evidence.
      Improvement of all symptoms of FBD in three out of four patients has been
      achieved. The diet may potentially improve stool frequency in patients with an
      ileal pouch or a high output ileostomy, or functional symptoms in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. FODMAPs in enteral formulas may also be responsible
      for diarrhoea induced by enteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction of
      FODMAPs is an effective therapy in the majority of patients with functional bowel
      symptoms and, provided dietitians are trained in the technique, should be first
      line therapy.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms among German students: prevalence,
      characteristics, and associations to somatic complaints, sleep, quality of life, 
      and childhood abdominal pain.
PG  - 311-6

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in the general
      population, and is linked to considerable impairments in daily functioning.
      Little is known about the prevalence of IBS symptoms among students. This study
      examined the prevalence and characteristics of IBS, sex differences, associations
      to other somatic complaints and sleep, quality of life (QoL), and childhood
      abdominal pain in a German university student population. METHODS: Using an
      Internet-based questionnaire, we assessed IBS criteria (according to Rome III),
      health complaints, health-related QoL (12-item short-form), healthcare-seeking
      behavior, absenteeism from classes, and subjective attributions in a sample of
      2399 university students (mean age: 24.16 years; 1701 female and 696 male
      students). RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS-like symptoms was 18.1% with a
      significant difference between male (15.2%) and female (21.0%) students. Logistic
      regression models showed that being long-term student doubles the risk for having
      IBS [adjusted Odds ratio (OR)=2.16], as did the presence of other health
      problems: recurrent backaches (adjusted OR=2.15), troubles falling asleep
      (adjusted OR=1.52), and recurrent abdominal pain during childhood (adjusted
      OR=2.01). The IBS group had significant impairment on 12-item short-form physical
      and mental dimensions compared with asymptomatic students. Approximately 60% of
      participants fulfilling IBS criteria never consulted a physician. Male students
      attributed their symptoms significantly more to nutrition than female students
      did, who attributed their symptoms significantly more often to stress and
      anxiety. CONCLUSION: IBS is a common syndrome among German university students
      and goes along with impaired health-related QoL. According to our data, students 
      reporting recurrent abdominal pain in childhood are especially at risk for IBS.

TI  - The role of psyllium fibre supplementation in treating irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - e107-14
AB  - North American family physicians and dietitians commonly recommend psyllium fibre
      supplementation for treating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this 
      review, evidence on the effectiveness of psyllium supplementation for diagnosed
      IBS symptoms was evaluated and summarized. A systematic search of MEDLINE,
      CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Included were full-length,
      peer-reviewed, English-language articles in which psyllium ingestion was tested
      for its effect on IBS symptoms. Quality of these articles also was assessed.
      Twelve met the criteria for complete data abstraction. Seventy-five percent of
      the studies examined were of weak quality. Study designs and methods were
      heterogeneous. Patient-perceived global symptoms improved significantly in six of
      the nine studies measuring a global symptom outcome. In one study, significant
      improvements occurred in reported abdominal pain; in three, improvement did not
      occur. Quality of life and flatulence did not improve significantly in any
      studies in which these outcomes were examined. The results of this systematic
      review indicate limited and conflicting evidence to support the recommendation of
      psyllium supplementation for symptomatic IBS treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterised by episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits.
      Many IBS sufferers believe that diet may play a role in triggering these episodes
      and may avoid certain foods. However relatively few studies have undertaken a
      dietary assessment in IBS sufferers to examine the wider impact of the condition 
      upon diet. METHODS: 104 individuals with IBS were recruited and asked to complete
      a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The data were analysed against
      Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom and
      observed intakes for the general population and for differences between IBS
      subtypes and the UK population. RESULTS: The data show that the dietary intakes
      of this population of IBS sufferers met the UK Dietary Reference Values. The
      average energy intake of the population exceeded the Estimated Average
      Requirements of the UK population and the balance of macronutrients was
      favourable. Intakes of selected micronutrients significantly exceeded the
      reference nutrient intakes. There were no differences between IBS subtypes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The IBS subpopulation appear to have an adequate and balanced
      macronutrient intake with no evidence of inadequate micronutrient intake.

PG  - 382-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181effa3b [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in children may be a
      precursor to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults. The prevalence of abnormal
      lactulose breath tests (LBT) suggesting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      (SIBO) has been reported as 91% in children with CAP and 35% in healthy controls.
      In addition, patients with IBS with SIBO who responded to nonabsorbable
      antibiotic treatment with normalization of LBT reported 75% global improvement in
      symptoms. The aim of the study was to test whether treatment with a nonabsorbable
      antibiotic may reduce symptoms in children with CAP. METHODS: Seventy-five
      children ages 8 to 18 years with CAP based on Rome II criteria were enrolled.
      Subjects underwent baseline LBT and completed symptom-based questionnaires. They 
      were then randomized in a 2:1, double-blind fashion to receive a 10-day course of
      550 mg of rifaximin or placebo 3 times per day (t.i.d.). LBT and questionnaires
      were repeated 2 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Forty-nine children received
      rifaximin and 26 received placebo. There were no differences in demographics
      between groups. Ninety-four percent who received rifaximin and 92% who received
      placebo had abnormal baseline LBT, suggesting SIBO (not significant [NS]). There 
      was no significant difference in symptom improvement between groups; however,
      only 20% of children treated with rifaximin achieved a normalized repeat LBT,
      demonstrating successful treatment of SIBO. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to adults with
      IBS, the prevalence of abnormal LBT suggesting SIBO in children with CAP is high;
      however, treatment with 10 days of rifaximin has low efficacy in normalizing LBT 
      in this group. Additional studies are needed to determine whether a treatment
      approach with higher efficacy would lead to improvement in children with CAP.

TI  - Health benefits of probiotics: are mixtures more effective than single strains?
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s00394-010-0166-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes
      incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of
      probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures 
      are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more
      or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: 
      Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including
      irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune
      function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation,
      inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
      However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its
      component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more
      effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide
      range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain
      probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains
      that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to
      synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic
      dose used in some studies is at present unclear.

TI  - Obesity predicts persistence of pain in children with functional gastrointestinal
      disorders.
PG  - 517-21
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2010.245 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The possible effect of obesity in the outcome of treated children with
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) has not yet 
      been studied. We hypothesized that obesity is associated with a poor long-term
      prognosis in children with FGIDs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in an
      outpatient clinic-based sample of patients diagnosed with abdominal pain-related 
      FGIDs. Principal outcome measured was persistence of pain at long-term follow-up 
      (12-15 months). Frequency of pain, intensity of pain, school absenteeism and
      disruption of daily activities were compared between obese and non-obese
      subjects. RESULTS: The group mean age was 13.27+/-3.84 years, distribution of
      diagnosis was 32% (functional abdominal pain), 42.5% (irritable bowel syndrome)
      and 25.5% (functional dyspepsia). Overall, 20.2% of patients were obese. A total 
      of 116 patients (61.7%) reported abdominal pain and 72 (38.3%) were asymptomatic 
      at long-term follow-up. Obese patients were more likely to have abdominal pain
      (P<0.0001), higher intensity of pain (P=0.0002), higher frequency of pain
      (P=0.0032), school absenteeism (P<0.0001) and disruption of daily activities
      (P<0.0001) at follow-up than non-obese patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity is
      associated with poor outcome and disability at long-term follow-up in children
      with abdominal pain-related FGIDs. Our novel findings could have important
      implications in the prognosis and management of FGIDs.

TI  - Cow's-milk allergy is a risk factor for the development of FGIDs in children.
PG  - 166-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181e85b55 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children.
      Their pathogenesis remains unknown and is most likely multifactorial. We
      hypothesized that noninfectious causes of inflammation affecting the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract early in life, such as cow's-milk allergy (CMA), can 
      predispose to the development of FGIDs later in childhood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Case-control study. Subjects were patients between 4 and 18 years diagnosed with 
      CMA in the first year of life at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL,
      between January 2000 and June 2009. Diagnosis of CMA was based on history and
      clinical findings. Siblings 4 to 18 years of age without a history of CMA were
      selected as controls. Cases completed the parental form of the Pediatric
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire to assess for GI
      symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects (mean age 8.1 +/- 4.48 years, 62% girls)
      and 53 controls (mean age 9.7 +/- 4.20 years, 55% girls) participated in the
      study. Twenty-three of 52 subjects (44.2%) reported GI symptoms that included
      abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea compared with 11 of 53 controls
      (20.75%) (odds ratio 3.03, P = 0.01). Abdominal pain was significantly more
      common in cases (16/52, 30.8%) versus controls (5/53, 9.43%) (odds ratio 4.27
      [1.43-12.7]) (chi(2) = 7.47, P = 0.01). Abnormal stool habits were more common in
      cases (15/52, 28.8%) versus controls (7/53, 13.2%), but the difference was not
      statistically significant. Ten of 52 subjects (19.2%) met the Questionnaire on
      Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version criteria for diagnosis of an
      FGID (7 irritable bowel syndrome, 2 functional dyspepsia, 1 functional abdominal 
      pain), whereas none in the control group did. CONCLUSIONS: CMA constitutes a risk
      factor for the development of FGIDs in children.
