TI  - Clinical utility of the assessment of fecal calprotectin in Lesniowski-Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 622-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: From the epidemiological point of view, Lesniowski-Crohn's disease 
      (CD) has become an important medical problem. It is essential to differentiate CD
      from functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, first of all, from
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are no simple, non-invasive tests available
      which could help to identify patients with common symptoms such as abdominal pain
      or diarrhea who should be referred for further evaluation, including endoscopy.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the
      assessment of fecal calprotectin concentration in patients with CD. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Stool samples were taken from 31 patients of the Gastroenterology, Human
      Nutrition and Internal Diseases Department of Poznan Medical University who were 
      diagnosed with CD. Patients suffering from IBS served as the control group.
      Calprotectin concentration was assessed by means of the immunoenzymatic ELISA
      method. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and blood cell count were
      determined. The clinical activity of CD was assessed by means of Crohn's Disease 
      Activity Index. An appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Mean 
      calprotectin concentration in CD group was 32.01 +/- 22.58 mg/l and it was
      statistically higher (p <0.0003) than among IBS patients. A concentration of
      16.01 mg/l had 67.7% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity in distinguishing between 
      CD and IBS. There was a positive correlation between calprotectin concentration
      and CRP, and negative--with hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment
      of fecal calprotectin concentration may be useful in differential diagnoses of CD
      and monitoring patients with CD.

TI  - Prebiotics, immune function, infection and inflammation: a review of the
      evidence.
PG  - 633-58
LID - 10.1017/S0007114508055608 [doi]
AB  - Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through
      resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon
      intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial
      members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal
      microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial
      effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory
      processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and
      evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory
      animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and 
      the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies
      in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system
      may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of
      intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten
      trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious
      outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in 
      specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in
      animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal
      inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but
      findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the
      results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of
      immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain
      intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Clinical trial: a multistrain probiotic preparation significantly reduces
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 97-103

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To
      investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms
      of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS.
      METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria,
      participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising
      two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB
      30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum
      CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8
      weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly
      during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A
      significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in
      scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was 
      observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the
      probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain
      probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.

TI  - Laboratory evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 566-70
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32830d3aaf [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      straightforward when alarm symptoms are present, such as bloody diarrhea and
      weight loss. When the presentation is subtle or atypical, physicians must
      determine which patients warrant evaluation for IBD. Appropriate use of
      noninvasive tests can help identify which patients should undergo further
      investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently IBD serologies lack high enough
      sensitivity and specificity to make them useful as a screening test for
      distinguishing IBD from other disorders, but they may have a role in classifying 
      subtypes of IBD. Fecal markers seem promising for helping to differentiate IBD
      from irritable bowl syndrome and for monitoring disease activity.
      Pharmacogenetically guided dosing is recommended for safe use of thiopurines but 
      ongoing routine laboratory monitoring remains important. Thiopurine metabolite
      measurement can be useful but may not be needed in all cases. SUMMARY: Primary
      care physicians should continue to rely on routine laboratory tests and clinical 
      suspicion to decide which patients with abdominal pain to refer to a
      gastroenterologist. Serology panels are not useful for IBD screening as the
      results may lead to unnecessary procedures. Although fecal markers do show
      promise as a screening test for IBD, patient resistance to providing stool
      samples may limit its usefulness in disease monitoring. Thiopurine metabolite
      levels are best used in conjunction with clinical status and routine laboratory
      tests to monitor clinical response and adverse events.

TI  - Dietary survey and total dietary fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome attending a tertiary referral hospital.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on their chemical extraction, dietary fibers are classified
      into crude fibers and total dietary fibers (TDF). TDF gives the best estimate of 
      fiber content in the diet. Whereas data on intake of crude fibers are available, 
      there is a lack of data on intake of TDF in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). AIM: We assessed the TDF and its source in the diet of patients
      with IBS and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Based on their predominant symptoms,
      81 patients with IBS (according to Rome II criteria) were categorized into
      constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=48), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D, n=16) and
      mixed type (IBS-M, n=17). Information was collected on fiber supplementation and 
      preference for high-fiber food. A pretested, open-ended, semi-quantitative food
      frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information on food groups
      and TDF. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=89) were recruited as HC.
      The mean (SD) age of patients and HC was 36.5 (11.4) years (59 men), and 36 (12) 
      years (62 men), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (48%) were taking
      medicinal fiber supplements, of which 28 patients were taking supplements daily
      (2.10 [0.84] teaspoon full). The mean daily TDF intake was 51.7 (23.1) g vs. 52.3
      (21.6) g for patients and HC, respectively (p=0.8). The intake of TDF was similar
      in patients having less (n=41) or more (n=40) preference for fiber-rich foods (55
      [23] g vs. 47 [22] g, p=0.16). The daily mean cereal intake in patients was
      significantly lower than that in HC (322 g vs. 404 g, p=0.001). However,
      consumption of fruits (150 g vs. 80 g, p=0.001) and vegetables (348 g vs. 219 g, 
      p=0.006) was higher in patients in comparison with HC. There was a positive
      correlation between TDF with cereals (p=0.001), pulses (p=0.001), vegetables and 
      fruits (p=0.033) in patients with IBS but only with cereals (p=0.001) in HC.
      CONCLUSION: The intake of TDF in patients with IBS and HC is much higher than the
      dietary recommendation for healthy Indians. Patients with IBS consumed more
      fruits and vegetables rather than cereals as compared with HC.

      syndrome.
PG  - 1275-80
LID - 10.1515/CCLM.2008.246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ruling out somatic bowel disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD), is an important goal in the management of abdominal complaints. Endoscopy 
      is commonly used but is invasive and expensive. Mucosal inflammation in IBD can
      be detected through fecal biomarkers, though the present enzyme-linked
      immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) tests require laboratory facilities. We validated
      the diagnostic performance of two new fecal rapid tests (FRTs) for the detection 
      of calprotectin and lactoferrin and assessed their potential to differentiate IBD
      from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: The calprotectin and lactoferrin
      FRTs and ELISA tests were performed on the fecal samples of 114 patients referred
      for endoscopy, 80% of whom had IBS and 20% IBD, and validated against the
      endoscopic diagnosis. RESULTS: The sensitivity and negative predictive value of
      the calprotectin FRT were both 100%, whereas they were 78% and 95%, respectively,
      for the lactoferrin FRT. The specificity and positive predictive value were
      slightly higher for the lactoferrin FRT. Both FRTs had similar diagnostic
      accuracy as the corresponding ELISA tests. CONCLUSIONS: The calprotectin and
      lactoferrin rapid tests are as good as the ELISA tests in detecting colonic
      inflammation. Given their simple use, FRTs can support the non-invasive exclusion
      of IBD, notably in primary care.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common conditions seen in
      primary care settings. Despite this, there is no consensus as to the pathogenesis
      of this disorder or a consistently effective therapeutic regimen for many
      patients. This has encouraged the use of various alternative therapies from
      behavioral or complementary medicine. This review will address the evidence for
      alternative therapies, including the following: cognitive behavior therapy,
      hypnosis, elimination diets based on food antibody testing, nutrition supplements
      (such as fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics), and, finally, peppermint,
      l-glutamine, zinc, and cromolyn sodium. The review also explores the evidence for
      and the therapeutic ramifications of the hypothesis that increased intestinal
      permeability underlies the symptoms of IBS in many patients, and how a
      therapeutic plan that addresses nutrition, elimination diets, and nutrition
      supplements may be useful in restoring the integrity of the gut immune barrier.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal
      pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a 
      disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore
      therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more
      recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI)
      microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of
      probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an
      upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the
      host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article 
      explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might
      lead to therapeutic benefit.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the development of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGIDs) after an episode of acute bacterial gastroenteritis (AGE) in
      children. STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study of children 3 to 19 years old with a
      positive result on a bacterial stool culture. 44 patients in each arm
      (unidirectional alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80). Children presenting at two
      pediatric hospitals (United States and Italy) for AGE who tested positive for
      bacteria on stool culture (2001-2005) were contacted at least 6 months after the 
      episode. Exposed children were matched with control subjects of similar age and
      sex consulting to the same hospitals for trauma or well-child visit within 4
      weeks of the index case. Symptoms were evaluated with a validated questionnaire
      for FGIDs assessing pain, diarrhea, and disability. RESULTS: 88 patients (46
      boys; mean age, 8.1 years; age range, 3-19 years) were recruited. Bacteria
      included Salmonella (54%), Campylobacter (32%), and Shigella (14%). 36% of
      exposed patients and 11% of control subjects complained of abdominal pain (P <
      .01). 87% had irritable bowel syndrome and 24% had dyspepsia. 56% reported onset 
      of pain following the AGE. CONCLUSION: There is a significant increase in cases
      of FGIDs after bacterial infections in children.

PG  - 580-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01139.x [doi]
AB  - Digestive tract proteases are best known for their proteolytic activity in the
      digestion of alimentary proteins. However, during the last decade, a possible
      role of proteases as signalling molecules has been emphasized with the discovery 
      of a novel class of G-protein coupled receptors located on cell membranes that
      may be activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular
      domain. Type 2 protease-activated receptors (PAR-2) are cleaved by
      serine-proteases such as trypsin and tryptase. PAR-2 is present in many
      intestinal cell types and particularly on epithelial cells. Multiple functions
      have been demonstrated in the gut for PAR-2, including epithelial permeability,
      mainly the intercellular permeability that is of paramount importance in the
      equilibrium between the external milieu (digestive contents) and the submucosal
      immune system. Alterations of both tissue and luminal levels of proteases or
      serine-protease activity may affect gut permeability and subsequently the immune 
      status of the mucosa. Activation of PAR-2 on epithelial cells may directly affect
      cytoskeleton contraction by triggering phosphorylation of myosin light chain with
      subsequent changes in tight junction permeability. Enhanced fecal protease level 
      has been recently reported in both organic (ulcerative colitis) and functional
      (irritable bowel syndrome) intestinal disorders and may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of such diseases.

TI  - The role of loperamide in gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - Loperamide is an effective therapy for a variety of diarrheal syndromes,
      including acute, nonspecific (infectious) diarrhea; traveler's diarrhea; and
      chemotherapy-related and protease inhibitor?associated diarrhea. Loperamide is
      effective for the "gut-directed" symptom of diarrhea in patients with painless
      diarrhea or diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Loperamide and
      diphenoxylate are commonly used to treat diarrhea in numerous settings of
      inflammatory bowel disease. Loperamide has also been observed to increase anal
      sphincter tone, which may lead to improvement of fecal continence in patients
      with and without diarrhea. Loperamide is generally well tolerated at recommended 
      nonprescription doses, with the most common side effects related to the impact on
      bowel motility (abdominal pain, distention, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and
      constipation).

PG  - 685-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jpeds.2007.10.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of amitriptyline (AMI) in treating
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adolescents. STUDY DESIGN: Adolescents 12 to 18
      years with newly diagnosed IBS were surveyed with a symptom checklist, pain
      rating scale, visual analog scale, and IBS quality of life (QOL) questionnaire.
      Subjects were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive AMI or placebo,
      and again completed surveys at 2, 6, 10, and 13 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-three
      patients (24 female) were enrolled. Patients receiving AMI were more likely to
      experience improvement from baseline in overall QOL at 6, 10, and 13 weeks (P =
      .019, .004, and .013). Patients receiving AMI were also more likely to experience
      a reduction in IBS-associated diarrhea at 6 and 10 weeks (P = .029 for both), a
      reduction in periumbilical pain at 10 weeks (P = .018), and a reduction in right 
      lower quadrant pain at 6, 10, and 13 weeks (P = .014, .039, and .004).
      CONCLUSION: AMI significantly improves overall QOL in adolescents with IBS and
      should be a therapeutic option for adolescents with this disorder.

PG  - 279-91
LID - 10.1055/s-2007-963427 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has increased over the last 50
      years in countries where a Western-style diet has been prominent or introduced
      and 20 - 65 % of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their
      symptoms to something in food that activates an abnormal response. However, data 
      from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although
      investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete
      review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre
      diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there
      appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this
      subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but
      dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear
      that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and
      probiotics in these areas.

TI  - OMICS-derived targets for inflammatory gut disorders: opportunities for the
      development of nutrition related biomarkers.
PG  - 271-87
AB  - Modern molecular nutrition focuses on health promotion, disease prevention and
      performance improvement through diet. In analogy to Pharmacogenetics and
      -genomics, the disciplines "Nutrigenetics" and "Nutrigenomics" have evolved.
      Nutrigenetics asks how individual genetic disposition, manifesting as
      single-nucleotide- and copy-number polymorphisms as well as epigenetic
      regulation, affects susceptibility to diet. Nutrigenomics addresses the inverse
      relationship, i.e. how diet influences gene transcription, protein expression and
      metabolism. The long-term objective of Nutrigenomics is personalised nutrition
      for maintenance and improvement of individual health and for disease prevention. 
      Transcriptomics can put Proteomics- and Metabonomics-derived markers into a
      larger biological perspective. Metabonomics is a diagnostic tool for metabolic
      classification of individuals with the asset of quantitative, non-invasive
      analysis of easily accessible human body fluids such as urine, blood and saliva. 
      This feature also applies to some extent to Proteomics, with the constraint that 
      the latter discipline is more complex in terms of composition and dynamic range
      of the sample. Apart from addressing the most complex "Ome", Proteomics
      represents the only platform that delivers not only markers for disposition and
      efficacy but also targets of intervention. Application of integrated Omic
      technologies will drive the understanding of interrelated pathways in healthy and
      pathological conditions and will help to define molecular 'switchboards',
      necessary to develop disease related biomarkers. This will contribute to the
      development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for both pharmacological
      and nutritional interventions. This paper reviews inflammatory gut disorders, the
      state-of-the-art of the three Omics platforms and discusses the implication of
      the latter in biomarker revelation for nutritionally actionable inflammatory
      disorders in the intestine.

TI  - Mast cells and cellularity of the colonic mucosa correlated with fatigue and
      depression in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 468-73
LID - 10.1136/gut.2007.127068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have an
      increased number of mast cells (MCs) in the colonic mucosa. Psychological factors
      are believed to contribute to the course of IBS. AIMS: To examine associations
      between fatigue, depression and MCs of the colonic mucosa in IBS. METHODS:
      Colonic biopsies were taken from 50 Rome II IBS patients, 21 healthy controls and
      11 depressed/fatigued patients without IBS. The cellularity of the lamina propria
      was determined as the number of inflammatory cells per high power field (hpf)
      through a 400x microscope. The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and the short form Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) evaluated the severity of fatigue and depression.
      RESULTS: IBS patients had a significant increase in the cellularity of the lamina
      propria compared with controls or with depressed patients (mean (SD) 94.5
      (48-110) vs 68 (58-82) and 78 (87-90) cells per hpf, p = 0.005 and p = 0.05,
      respectively), in particular of MCs (9.3 (5.6-11.7) vs 4.0 (2.7-6.8) and 4.3
      (2.8-7.8) cells per hpf, p = 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). Both the FIS and
      BDI scores were significantly higher in IBS or in depressed patients than in
      controls (p<0.001). In IBS, the FIS score correlated significantly with the
      cellularity of the lamina propria (r = 0.51, p<0.0001) and MCs (r = 0.64,
      p<0.0001). In IBS, the BDI score correlated significantly with MCs (r = 0.29, p =
      0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated MCs counts are a key feature of the low-grade
      inflammatory infiltrate in the caecal mucosa of IBS. Fatigue and depression are
      associated with mucosal cell counts, in particular MCs, suggesting that
      psychological factors are associated with the low-grade inflammatory infiltrate
      in IBS.

TI  - Increased faecal serine protease activity in diarrhoeic IBS patients: a colonic
      lumenal factor impairing colonic permeability and sensitivity.
PG  - 591-9
LID - 10.1136/gut.2007.140210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is
      characterised by elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity. The aims of
      this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease
      activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in
      colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the
      role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling
      cascade in this process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Faecal enzymatic activities were
      assayed in healthy subjects and patients with IBS, ulcerative colitis and acute
      infectious diarrhoea. Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control
      subjects and IBS-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon
      distension was recorded in wild-type and PAR-2(-/-) mice, and CPP was evaluated
      on colonic strips in Ussing chambers. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and
      phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
      The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in IBS-D patients 
      compared with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) or infectious diarrhoea is of 
      neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with
      antiprotease activity of endogenous origin. Mucosal application of faecal
      supernatants from IBS-D patients in mice evoked allodynia and increased CPP by
      92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors and
      dependent on PAR-2 expression. In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from
      IBS-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin
      light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes. CONCLUSIONS:
      Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of IBS-D patients evokes a
      PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent allodynia in
      mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of IBS.

AB  - AIM: To examine the power of correlation between IBS-QOL Questionnare and BEST
      index in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: The IBS-QOL and BEST
      index were administered to 71 patients with IBS twice: before and after
      treatment. Statistical analysis to test the correlation between IBS-QOL and BEST 
      index was performed using Spearman's rho coefficient. RESULTS: The study cohort
      included 71 patients with Rome-III IBS evaluated at the State Research Institute 
      of Nutrition of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (mean age 41,4; mean IBS-QOL 
      = 65,6; 76% women). The mean completion + scoring time for BEST was under 3
      minutes vs 25 minutes for IBS-QOL. There was a striking correlation (r = - 0,8)
      between BEST and IBS-QOL results. CONCLUSIONS: BEST is a concise, rapidly
      completed, point-of-care IBS severity index that demonstrates large correlation
      with well-validated instrument for assessing QOL (IBS-QOL) in IBS patients.

      following Giardia lamblia infection.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial overgrowth has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of this study was to investigate
      whether post-infectious IBS following Giardia lamblia infection is related to
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as diagnosed by the lactulose breath test (LBT).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with persistent gastrointestinal
      complaints related to a recent outbreak of G. lamblia infection were included in 
      the study. Despite one or several courses of treatment with metronidazole during 
      the previous months, 23 of the patients were still stool positive for G. lamblia,
      whereas the remaining 54 patients had cleared the infection. All patients and 42 
      healthy volunteers underwent a LBT with 10 g lactulose, and their customary and
      post-LBT abdominal symptoms were scored. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of the
      patients had IBS. Lactulose-induced hydrogen breath excretion was not
      significantly different in patients and controls. Customary and post-LBT symptoms
      were abnormally high in the patients, irrespective of both G. lamblia infection
      status and LBT results. Furthermore, lactulose challenge replicated the patients'
      customary complaints in 70% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal
      complaints in patients with persistent or cleared giardiasis were unrelated to
      hydrogen breath excretion after lactulose challenge. Post-giardiasis IBS cannot
      be ascribed to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as diagnosed by LBT.

TI  - Effects of symbiotic preparations on constipated irritable bowel syndrome
      symptoms.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies that are being
      used to treat different gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel
      syndrome, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. AIMS: Evaluating 
      the effects of a symbiotic preparation on symptoms and colonic transit in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and significant bloating. METHODS: We
      carried out an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter trial on 129
      patients meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome who did not have
      lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing
      psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse. For three months, the patients were
      treated with a symbiotic preparation and were investigated trough questionnaires 
      on symptoms. Data on bloating and abdominal pain were obtained using the
      McNemar-Bowker's test, while data on stool frequency were evaluated using the
      t-test. RESULTS: The administration of a symbiotic preparation to these patients 
      modified the clinical picture and intestinal function, with a significant
      increase of stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, although the study had an
      open design, represent a further analysis of positive symbiotic effects on
      clinical manifestations and intestinal function in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome.

TI  - Impact of sleep disturbances in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1748-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Normal sleep is paramount for a healthy lifestyle and high quality of
      life. Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several
      chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the
      role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The 
      aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated
      measures of sleep and quality of life. METHODS: A self-administered, mail-in
      questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The
      questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 
      a measure of disease severity and the IBD-Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total 
      of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: The IBD subjects
      reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation,
      higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day-time energy, increased
      tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The
      abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The
      reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score (r(2) =
      0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease
      status were correlated. CONCLUSION: The results show that IBD patients have
      significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem
      might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and
      might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare-up.
      Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance 
      should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.

TI  - Recurrent abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome in children.
PG  - 581-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recurrent abdominal pain continues to be one of the most
      ubiquitous conditions faced by the healthcare team, and has a significant
      emotional and economic impact. We have moved from considering it a psychological 
      condition to recognizing the physiological and environmental contributions, and
      considering the condition in the framework of a biopsychosocial model where
      biology, psychology and social environment interact. Here, we review current
      studies addressing etiologies, diagnostic techniques and treatment options for
      recurrent abdominal pain in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies continue to
      highlight the role of visceral hypersensitivity in recurrent abdominal pain. The 
      psychological state of the child and the parent (most often the mother) in terms 
      of their anxiety, somatization and coping skills can, however, modulate the
      expression of symptoms. Diagnosis still is made by history and physical
      examination. Newer treatment options include relaxation and distraction therapies
      as well as medications. The role of probiotics in children remains to be defined.
      SUMMARY: The approach to the child with recurrent abdominal pain must include the
      recognition of the physiological contributions, and this information must be
      relayed to the child and parents. Acknowledgement also must be paid to the role
      of psychological state in the parent as well as in the child in modulating the
      severity of symptoms.

TI  - Hydrogen breath testing versus LCT genotyping for the diagnosis of lactose
      intolerance: a matter of age?
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (-13910 C/T and -22018 G/A)
      upstream of the lactase gene (LCT) have been found to be associated with lactose 
      tolerance in Europeans. METHODS: In one hundred and twenty Austrian outpatients, 
      who visited the physician's office for symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), hydrogen breath testing (HBT) and LCT genotyping by polymerase chain
      reaction and reverse-hybridisation were performed in parallel. RESULTS: The
      coincidence between a genotype suggesting lactase non-persistence (lactose
      intolerance) and a positive HBT result was almost perfect (97.4% for LCT-13910
      C/T and 100% for LCT-22018 G/A). Between a genotype indicating lactase
      persistence (lactose tolerance) and a negative HBT result the coincidence was
      lower (72% and 71.4%, respectively). Among heterozygotes, there was a
      statistically significant increase in the proportion of positive HBT results with
      age. Both SNPs were in accordance in 117/120 (97.5%) patients. CONCLUSION:
      Genetic analysis of LCT-13910 C/T and LCT-22018 G/A is a good indicator for the
      presence of lactose intolerance. Because age, as well as a number of secondary
      causes (e.g. celiac disease), can influence HBT results, it is useful to combine 
      HBT and genetic analysis in the diagnostic assessment of IBS.

TI  - Intestinal gas in plain abdominal radiographs does not correlate with symptoms
      after lactulose challenge.
PG  - 589-93
AB  - OBSERVATION: Intestinal gas production and abdominal discomfort can be triggered 
      by the ingestion of carbohydrates such as lactulose. Using plain abdominal
      radiographs, we studied whether subjective complaints after a lactulose breath
      test would be quantitatively related to intestinal gas volumes. METHODS:
      Abdominal symptoms after the breath test were quantified by a written
      questionnaire and gas volumes were scored in plain abdominal radiographs, in 50
      consecutive patients with unexplained, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms.
      Breath excretion of hydrogen and methane was determined in all patients. RESULTS:
      Forty-two (84%) of the patients claimed that their post-breath test symptoms were
      a true replicate of their customary discomfort. Total symptom scores (sum of
      scores for pain/discomfort, borborygmi, bloating, diarrhea, constipation) or any 
      specific symptom score were not significantly correlated to gas volume scores
      (r=-0.04; P=0.8 for total symptom score). The 13 (26%) methane producers had
      significantly higher mean gas volume scores compared with nonproducers (0.38 vs. 
      0.24; P=0.0008), but fewer symptoms (total symptom score 11.9 vs. 18.2; P=0.17). 
      CONCLUSION: Intestinal gas volume, as scored in plain abdominal radiographs, is
      not correlated with abdominal discomfort after lactulose challenge. Intestinal
      gas may not be the major cause of abdominal discomfort following carbohydrate
      ingestion in patients with functional gut disorders.

TI  - A clinical audit of the efficacy of tegaserod as a prokinetic agent in the
      intensive care unit.
PG  - 148-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To formally document the effectiveness of tegaserod as a prokinetic
      agent in intensive care patients. METHODS: The audit was designed in consultation
      with the Northern Territory Drug and Therapeutics Committee. Tegaserod was added 
      to the feeding protocol and prokinetic algorithm in the ICU, and a prospective
      audit was performed of patients receiving the medication between May and
      September 2006. RESULTS: Over the 5-month period, 40 patients received tegaserod 
      after failing to respond to two doses of metoclopramide. Median daily volume of
      gastric aspirate was reduced from 1220mL in the 24 hours before tegaserod to
      887.5mL in the first 24 hours after its introduction, and to 280mL in the second 
      24 hours (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). Tegaserod was an effective
      prokinetic agent in 85% (34) patients. Attributable diarrhoea occurred in 13% (5)
      patients, but did not require intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Tegaserod is an
      effective alternative prokinetic agent for ICU patients with a safer side-effect 
      profile. We believe it warrants further investigation.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].
PG  - 1619-26
AB  - Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for
      this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate 
      drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is
      impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for
      reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. 
      Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory 
      proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify
      treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral
      hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low
      doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists
      (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists
      (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis
      and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy,
      relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a
      possible treatment in the future.

TI  - Psychosocial factors at work and in every day life are associated with irritable 
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 473-80
AB  - The etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) tends to be complex and
      multi-factorial and there is still a lack of understanding of how different
      psychosocial factors are associated with the syndrome. Our aim was to examine the
      occurrence of psychosocial and behavioural factors among patients diagnosed with 
      IBS in primary care. The study had an epidemiological population-based
      case-control design comparing 347 IBS cases to 1041 age and sex matched controls 
      from the general population. A survey was directed to cases and controls based on
      validated questions asking for mood status, job strain, family history of IBS,
      and sleeping habits as well as education, nutritional and exercise habits and
      medication. In multivariate analyses, independent associations were found between
      IBS and lack of influence on work planning, a family history of IBS, anxiety, and
      sleeping disturbances. Important factors associated with IBS diagnosis among
      females were anxiety as well as family history of IBS and lack of
      co-determination at work. For males, only lack of influence on working pace and
      family history of IBS remained independently associated with an IBS diagnosis.
      The causal associations of the complex risk factor panorama for IBS warrants
      further study. This study indicates that there should be a special focus on
      investigating the psychosocial working conditions and their associations to IBS.

TI  - Detection of Celiac disease in primary care: a multicenter case-finding study in 
      North America.
PG  - 1454-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common lifelong disorders in
      western countries. However, most cases remain currently undiagnosed in North
      America, mostly due to poor awareness of CD by primary care physicians.
      OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (a) to determine whether an active
      case-finding strategy in primary care could increase the frequency of CD
      diagnosis and (b) to determine the most common clinical presentations of the
      condition. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective study involving adult
      subjects during the years 2002-2004, attending one of the participating
      practices. All individuals with symptoms or conditions known to be associated
      with CD were tested for immunoglobulin A anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, 
      and those with elevated anti-tTG were subsequently tested for IgA antiendomysial 
      antibodies (EMA). All subjects who were positive for EMA were advised to undergo 
      an intestinal biopsy and HLA typing. RESULTS: The study group included 737 women 
      and 239 men, with a median age of 54.3 yr. A positive anti-tTG test was found in 
      30 out of 976 investigated subjects (3.07%, 95% CI 1.98-4.16). CD was diagnosed
      in 22 patients (18 women, 4 men). The most frequent reasons for CD screening in
      these 22 cases were bloating (12/22), thyroid disease (11/22), irritable bowel
      syndrome (7/22), unexplained chronic diarrhea (6/22), chronic fatigue (5/22), and
      constipation (4/22). The prevalence of CD in the serologically screened sample
      was 2.25% (95% CI 1.32-3.18). The diagnostic rate was low at baseline (0.27 cases
      per thousand visits, 95% CI 0.13-0.41) and significantly increased to 11.6 per
      thousand visits (95% CI 6.8-16.4, P < 0.001) following active screening
      implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an active case-finding 
      strategy in the primary care setting is an effective means to improve the
      diagnostic rate of CD in North America.

TI  - A pilot study of fecal serine-protease activity: a pathophysiologic factor in
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 550-5
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains
      only partially understood, and no specific or universally effective patient
      management procedure has been developed to date. Our study was designed to
      evaluate if colonic luminal serine-proteases may be a relevant pathophysiologic
      marker of IBS. METHODS: Fecal samples of 38 IBS patients, 15 patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and 15 healthy controls were studied. Fecal
      serine-protease activity was determined photometrically by using azocasein as a
      proteolytic substrate; fecal pancreatic elastase-1 and mast cell tryptase content
      were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fecal secretory leukocyte
      protease inhibitor concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay in control subjects and in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. RESULTS:
      Fecal serine-protease activity was 3-fold higher in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS than in both controls and IBS patients with either
      constipation or alternating bowel habits. Fecal serine-protease activity was not 
      correlated with the frequency of bowel movements in all groups. Increased
      serine-protease activity also was detected in stools of UC patients. No
      significant difference was observed in the fecal mast cell tryptase and
      pancreatic elastase concentrations between all groups, or in the fecal secretory 
      leukocyte protease inhibitor concentration between controls and
      diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal serine-protease activity is
      increased markedly in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. This increase,
      however, is not coupled with changes in either mast cell tryptase or pancreatic
      elastase concentrations. Thus, serine-protease activity in the colon may be a
      pathophysiologic factor in the development of diarrhea-predominant IBS.

TI  - Characteristics of pain and stooling in children with recurrent abdominal pain.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To collect symptom data longitudinally from children with recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) and control (asymptomatic) children. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Children with RAP (n = 77) and controls (n = 33) 7 to 10 years of age completed
      daily diaries for 2 weeks tracking pain frequency and severity, how often the
      pain interfered with activities, and stooling pattern. RESULTS: RAP children
      reported a greater number of pain episodes and greater pain severity than control
      children. Pain commonly was reported to be in the periumbilical area and occurred
      evenly across the day in both groups. However, the pain interfered with activity 
      more often in the RAP group. There was a positive relationship between pain and
      interference with activities. Both groups reported stool changes, but there were 
      no differences between groups in stool character (eg, hard, mushy). For both
      groups, the presence of watery stool was related positively to pain. Of children 
      with RAP, 65% could be categorized as having irritable bowel syndrome, whereas
      35% were classifiable as having functional abdominal pain according to the
      pediatric Rome II criteria. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is
      the first longitudinal report of symptoms in children with RAP compared with
      controls. These data demonstrate that there is considerable overlap between
      children with RAP and control children on a number of items commonly obtained in 
      the history (eg, pain location, timing, stooling pattern). Most children with RAP
      could be characterized as having irritable bowel syndrome. The relationship
      between pain reports and interference with activities substantiates the need to
      deal specifically with the abdominal pain to decrease disability. The
      relationship between pain and watery stools requires further study.

TI  - A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Lactobacillus GG for
      abdominal pain disorders in children.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are common in school-aged 
      children; however, there is no reliable treatment. AIM: To determine the efficacy
      of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A
      total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia
      (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were 
      enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received
      LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study
      population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no
      pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6,
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI:
      4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely
      to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3,
      95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02),
      but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n =
      47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately
      increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.

TI  - Anxiety and pain symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease and
      functional gastrointestinal disorders undergoing colonoscopy.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare pain and anxiety scores between children with inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and those with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID)
      undergoing colonoscopy and to examine the role of anxiety and procedure length in
      predicting reports of pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children ages 10 to 18 years
      undergoing colonoscopy (general anesthesia) for the first time completed pain and
      anxiety questionnaires immediately before the procedure and a pain questionnaire 
      48 hours after colonoscopy. The diagnosis was determined by chart review and
      physician interview. RESULTS: Children with FGID had a longer duration of pain
      than those with IBD. Children with FGID endorsed a greater total number of the
      pain descriptors. The FGID group reported higher usual pain severity and greater 
      postprocedural pain. No differences in anxiety were reported. However, higher
      levels of anxiety were associated with higher pain scores at the time of
      colonoscopy in children with IBD. It required significantly more time to perform 
      colonoscopy in the IBD group than in the FGID group. Longer procedure duration
      was positively correlated with pain in children with FGID but not in children
      with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Children with FGID report more usual pain symptoms and may
      describe more pain after a colonoscopy when compared with children with IBD.
      Anxiety appears to play a role in pain severity after colonoscopy in children
      presenting with IBD, but not in children with FGID.

TI  - Long-term outcome of functional childhood constipation.
PG  - 64-9
AB  - We investigated whether functional childhood constipation (FCC) is an early
      expression in the continuum of functional disorders such as adult constipation,
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and dyspepsia. Adults >or=18 years with a
      diagnosis of FCC verified by one pediatric gastroenterologist participated in the
      questionnaire-based study. Controls were comprised of adults who underwent
      tonsillectomy as otherwise healthy children during the period corresponding to
      the FCC diagnosis. The prevalence of constipation, IBS, and dyspepsia was
      determined by the Bowel Disease Questionnaire. Twenty FCC adults (8 females),
      median age 22 years, were compared with 17 adult controls (10 females), median
      age 22.9 years. The frequency of constipation in FCC adults was not different
      from that in controls (25% versus 23.5%). The frequency of IBS in FCC adults was 
      higher than in controls (55% versus 23.5%; P < 0.05). Dyspepsia was reported by
      25% of both groups. The median follow-up period of the FCC adults was 14 years.
      In a long-term follow-up of a small sample, the prevalence of constipation in FCC
      adults is comparable to that in controls. Childhood constipation appears to be a 
      predictor of IBS in adulthood.
