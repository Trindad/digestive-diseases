TI  - Perceived Stress in Patients with Common Gastrointestinal Disorders: Associations
      with Quality of Life, Symptoms and Disease Management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Research supports relationships between stress and
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and disorders. This pilot study assesses
      relationships between perceived stress, quality of life (QOL), and self-reported 
      pain ratings as an indicator of symptom management in patients who self-reported 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RESULTS: In the full sample (n = 402) perceived
      stress positively correlated with depression (r = 0.76, P < .0001), fatigue (r = 
      0.38, P < .0001), sleep disturbance (r = 0.40, P < .0001), average pain (r =
      0.26, P < .0001), and worst pain (r = 0.25, P < .0001). Higher perceived stress
      also correlated with lower mental health-related QOL. Similar correlations were
      found for the participants with GERD (n = 188), IBS (n = 132), and IBD (n = 82). 
      Finally, there were significant correlations in the GERD cohort between perceived
      stress, and average pain (r = 0.34, P < .0001) and worst pain (r = 0.29, P <
      .0001), and in the IBD cohort between perceived stress, and average pain (r =
      0.32, P < .0001), and worst pain (r = 0.35, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived
      stress broadly correlated with QOL characteristics in patients with GERD, IBS,
      and IBD, and their overall QOL was significantly lower than the general
      population. Perceived stress also appeared to be an indicator of symptom
      management (self-reported pain ratings) in GERD and IBD, but not IBS. While
      future research using objective measures of stress and symptom/disease management
      is needed to confirm these associations, as well as to evaluate the ability of
      stress reduction interventions to improve perceived stress, QOL and disease
      management in these GI disorders, integrative medicine treatment programs would
      be most beneficial to study.

AB  - AIM: To determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: In this
      randomized triple-blind trial, adult IBS volunteers who were recruited according 
      to Rome III criteria received 10(9) or 10(10) colony-forming units of NCFM or
      placebo daily for 12 wk. IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), which constituted 
      the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes, including individual IBS symptoms,
      IBS-related QoL questionnaire, anxiety and depression, defecation frequency, and 
      stool consistency, were assessed at baseline at the end of the 8-wk run-in
      period, after 4 and 12 wk of intervention, and after a 4-wk washout. RESULTS: A
      total of 340 of 391 randomized volunteers completed the trial. IBS-SSS improved
      over 12 wk of treatment in all treatment groups, decreasing by a mean +/- SD of
      44.0 +/- 80.2, 50.8 +/- 82.4, and 48.3 +/- 72.2 in the placebo, active low-dose, 
      and active high-dose groups, respectively. Similarly, secondary outcomes did not 
      differ between treatment groups. However, in a post hoc analysis of volunteers
      with moderate to severe abdominal pain at baseline (VAS > 35/100), the treatment 
      significantly reduced the sensation of abdominal pain. Pain scores fell by 20.8
      +/- 22.8, 29.4 +/- 17.9, and 31.2 +/- 21.9 in the placebo, active low-dose, and
      active high-dose groups, respectively (P value for placebo vs combined active
      doses = 0.0460). CONCLUSION: NCFM alleviates moderate to severe abdominal pain,
      consistent with earlier observations of this strain mitigating visceral pain
      through increased analgesic receptor expression.

TI  - A review of dose-responses of probiotics in human studies.
PG  - 143-151
LID - 10.3920/BM2016.0140 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic definition requires the administration of an 'adequate amount' in
      order to obtain a health benefit. What that amount should be is not indicated.
      Here, an overview is given of studies that investigated the dose-response
      relation of probiotics in human interventions. Studies were divided in;
      meta-analyses, meta-analyses on specific probiotic strains, and studies testing
      two or more doses of a probiotic (combination) in the same study. Meta-analyses
      on the effect of probiotics on antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) suggest a
      dose-response effect; for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea on the other
      hand no dose-response was observed. For other end-points; such as necrotising
      enterocolitis, prevention of atopic dermatitis and slow intestinal transit, no
      dose-response relation was identified in meta-analyses. For prophylaxis in
      colorectal cancer and relief of irritable bowel syndrome, no dose-response
      relation was determined. However, for blood pressure, a meta-analysis observed
      that higher doses (greater than 10(11) cfu) were more effective than lower doses.
      Meta-analyses of specific strains suggest a break-point for effectiveness of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children;
      no dose-response was observed for two other probiotics assessed. Studies
      comparing two or more doses indicate that faecal recovery and risk reduction of
      AAD follow a positive dose-response relationship. Other end-points such as immune
      markers, general health, and bowel function did not exhibit clear dose-response
      relations. For AAD, the findings are very compelling; both meta-analyses and
      dedicated dose-response studies observe a positive correlation between dose and
      AAD risk. These findings do not allow for extrapolation, but suggest that
      studying higher doses for this end-point would be worthwhile. The lack of a clear
      dose-response for other end-points, does not mean it does not exist; present data
      does just not allow drawing any conclusions.

PG  - 1430-1437

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

TI  - The human intestinal microbiota of constipated-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome patients exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.
PG  - 39399
LID - 10.1038/srep39399 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal microbiota of patients with constipated-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome (C-IBS) displays chronic dysbiosis. Our aim was to determine
      whether this microbial imbalance instigates perturbation of the host intestinal
      mucosal immune response, using a model of human microbiota-associated rats (HMAR)
      and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. The analysis of
      the microbiota composition revealed a decrease of the relative abundance of
      Bacteroides, Roseburia-Eubacterium rectale and Bifidobacterium and an increase of
      Enterobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio sp., and mainly Akkermansia muciniphila in
      C-IBS patients compared to healthy individuals. The bacterial diversity of the
      gut microbiota of healthy individuals or C-IBS patients was maintained in
      corresponding HMAR. Animals harboring a C-IBS microbiota had reduced DSS colitis 
      with a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines from innate, Th1, and
      Th17 responses. The pre-treatment of conventional C57BL/6 mice or HMAR with A.
      muciniphila, but not with Escherichia coli, prior exposure to DSS also resulted
      in a reduction of colitis severity, highlighting that the anti-inflammatory
      effect of the gut microbiota of C-IBS patients is mediated, in part, by A.
      muciniphila. This work highlights a novel aspect of the crosstalk between the gut
      microbiota of C-IBS patients and host intestinal homeostasis.

TI  - Abdominal Pain-Associated Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder Prevalence in
      Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on Gluten-Free Diet: A Multinational
      Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that children with celiac disease (CD) on
      gluten-free diet are at increased risk of abdominal pain (AP)
      associated-functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). STUDY DESIGN: This was 
      a multinational cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 2015. Patients 4-18 
      years of age with CD on gluten-free diet for longer than 6 months were recruited 
      from pediatric CD clinics in US and Italy. Control groups included siblings of
      children with CD (with normal tissue transglutaminase levels) and unrelated
      controls. Subjects or parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III. RESULTS: Children (n = 289) were recruited
      (55% US, 45% Italy): 96 children with CD, 96 sibling controls, and 97 unrelated
      controls. Chronic AP was present in 30 (30.9%) subjects with CD, 22 (22.7%)
      sibling controls, and 21 (21.6%) unrelated controls (P = .26 patients with CD vs 
      siblings; P = .18 patients with CD vs unrelated; P = .96 siblings vs unrelated). 
      AP-FGIDs were present in 8 (8.2%) subjects with CD, 8 (8.2%) sibling controls,
      and 2 (2.1%) unrelated controls (P = 1.00 subjects with CD vs sibling controls; P
      = .06 subjects with CD vs unrelated controls; P = .06 sibling controls vs
      unrelated controls). CONCLUSION: This multinational study evaluated the
      prevalence of chronic abdominal pain and AP-FGIDs in the pediatric population
      with CD. We found that subjects with CD and controls have a similar prevalence of
      chronic AP and AP-FGIDs. This suggests that not all types of gastrointestinal
      inflammation result in AP-FGIDs in children.

AB  - The theory of a fetal origin of adult diseases links many pathological conditions
      to very early life events and is known as a "developmental programming"
      phenomenon. The mechanisms of this phenomenon are not quite understood and have
      been explained by inflammation, stress, etc. In particular the epidemic of
      obesity, with more than 64% of women being overweight or obese, has been
      associated with conditions in later life such as mental disorders, diabetes,
      asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. Interestingly, these diseases were
      classified a decade ago as Clinical Syndrome of Endocannabinoid Deficiency
      (CECD), which was first described by Russo in 2004. Cannabinoids have been used
      for the treatment of chronic pain for millenniums and act through the mechanism
      of "kick-starting" the components of the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS). ECS
      is a pharmacological target for the treatment of obesity, inflammation,
      cardiovascular and neuronal damage, and pain. We hypothesize that the
      deteriorating effect of maternal obesity on offspring health is explained by the 
      mechanism of Fetal Syndrome of Endocannabinoid Deficiency (FSECD), which
      accompanies maternal obesity. Here we provide support for this hypothesis.

TI  - Altered expression of Butyrophilin (BTN) and BTN-like (BTNL) genes in intestinal 
      inflammation and colon cancer.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - Several Butyrophilin (BTN) and Btn-like (BTNL) molecules control T lymphocyte
      responses, and are genetically associated with inflammatory disorders and cancer.
      In this study, we present a comprehensive expression analysis of human and murine
      BTN and BTNL genes in conditions associated with intestinal inflammation and
      cancer. Using real-time PCR, expression of human BTN and BTNL genes was analyzed 
      in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and
      colon tumors. Expression of murine Btn and Btnl genes was examined in mouse
      models of spontaneous colitis (Muc2(-/-)) and intestinal tumorigenesis
      (Apc(Min/+)). Our analysis indicates a strong association of several of the human
      genes with ulcerative colitis and colon cancer; while especially BTN1A1, BTN2A2, 
      BTN3A3, and BTNL8 were significantly altered in inflammation, colonic tumors
      exhibited significantly decreased levels of BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 as
      compared to unaffected tissue. Colonic inflammation in Muc2(-/-) mice
      significantly down-regulated the expression of particularly Btnl1, Btnl4, and
      Btnl6 mRNA, and intestinal polyps derived from Apc(Min/+) mice displayed altered 
      levels of Btn1a1, Btn2a2, and Btnl1 transcripts. Thus, our data present an
      association of BTN and BTNL genes with intestinal inflammation and cancer and
      represent a valuable resource for further studies of this gene family.

      factors, genetics and certain foods are proposed to contribute. Congenital
      sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a rare genetic form of disaccharide
      malabsorption characterised by diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating, which are 
      features common to IBS. We tested sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene variants for their
      potential relevance in IBS. DESIGN: We sequenced SI exons in seven familial
      cases, and screened four CSID mutations (p.Val557Gly, p.Gly1073Asp, p.Arg1124Ter 
      and p.Phe1745Cys) and a common SI coding polymorphism (p.Val15Phe) in a
      multicentre cohort of 1887 cases and controls. We studied the effect of the 15Val
      to 15Phe substitution on SI function in vitro. We analysed p.Val15Phe genotype in
      relation to IBS status, stool frequency and faecal microbiota composition in 250 
      individuals from the general population. RESULTS: CSID mutations were more common
      in patients than asymptomatic controls (p=0.074; OR=1.84) and Exome Aggregation
      Consortium reference sequenced individuals (p=0.020; OR=1.57). 15Phe was detected
      in 6/7 sequenced familial cases, and increased IBS risk in case-control and
      population-based cohorts, with best evidence for diarrhoea phenotypes (combined
      p=0.00012; OR=1.36). In the population-based sample, 15Phe allele dosage
      correlated with stool frequency (p=0.026) and Parabacteroides faecal microbiota
      abundance (p=0.0024). The SI protein with 15Phe exhibited 35% reduced enzymatic
      activity in vitro compared with 15Val (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SI gene variants
      coding for disaccharidases with defective or reduced enzymatic activity
      predispose to IBS. This may help the identification of individuals at risk, and
      contribute to personalising treatment options in a subset of patients.

TI  - Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Adolescents With Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.503 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Few treatments have been able to effectively manage pediatric
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy
      (Internet-CBT) based on exposure for abdominal symptoms is effective for adult
      IBS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Internet-CBT
      based on behavioral exposure for adolescents with IBS. METHODS: Adolescents with 
      IBS fulfilling the Rome III criteria were randomized to either Internet-CBT or a 
      wait-list control. The Internet-CBT was a 10-week intervention where the main
      component was exposure to IBS symptoms by reduction of avoidance of abdominal
      symptoms and instead stepwise provocation of symptoms. The primary outcome was
      total score on Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale for IBS (GSRS-IBS).
      Secondary outcomes included adolescent- and parent-rated quality of life and
      parent-rated gastrointestinal symptoms. Difference between groups was assessed
      from pretreatment to posttreatment and the Internet-CBT group was also evaluated 
      at 6 months after treatment completion. RESULTS: A total of 101 adolescents with 
      IBS (13-17 years of age) were included in this study. Dropout rates were low (6%)
      and all randomized patients were included in intent-to-treat analyses based on
      mixed effects models. Analyses showed a significant larger pretreatment to
      posttreatment change on the primary outcome GSRS-IBS (B=-6.42, P=0.006, effect
      size Cohen's d=0.45, 95% confidence interval (0.12, 0.77)) and on almost all
      secondary outcomes for the Internet-CBT group compared with the control group.
      After 6 months, the results were stable or significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS:
      Internet-CBT based on exposure exercises for adolescents with IBS can effectively
      improve gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life.

LID - 10.1111/pai.12659 [doi]
AB  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FA)
      including food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food
      protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), and food protein-induced allergic
      proctocolitis (FPIAP) are relatively uncommon in infants and young children, but 
      are likely under-diagnosed. Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with
      majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of
      symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed
      for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to
      the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the
      role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is
      not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be 
      limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in
      infants.

TI  - Elevated basal serum tryptase identifies a multisystem disorder associated with
      increased TPSAB1 copy number.
PG  - 1564-1569
LID - 10.1038/ng.3696 [doi]
AB  - Elevated basal serum tryptase levels are present in 4-6% of the general
      population, but the cause and relevance of such increases are unknown.
      Previously, we described subjects with dominantly inherited elevated basal serum 
      tryptase levels associated with multisystem complaints including cutaneous
      flushing and pruritus, dysautonomia, functional gastrointestinal symptoms,
      chronic pain, and connective tissue abnormalities, including joint hypermobility.
      Here we report the identification of germline duplications and triplications in
      the TPSAB1 gene encoding alpha-tryptase that segregate with inherited increases
      in basal serum tryptase levels in 35 families presenting with associated
      multisystem complaints. Individuals harboring alleles encoding three copies of
      alpha-tryptase had higher basal serum levels of tryptase and were more
      symptomatic than those with alleles encoding two copies, suggesting a gene-dose
      effect. Further, we found in two additional cohorts (172 individuals) that
      elevated basal serum tryptase levels were exclusively associated with duplication
      of alpha-tryptase-encoding sequence in TPSAB1, and affected individuals reported 
      symptom complexes seen in our initial familial cohort. Thus, our findings link
      duplications in TPSAB1 with irritable bowel syndrome, cutaneous complaints,
      connective tissue abnormalities, and dysautonomia.

TI  - Recommendations for pharmacological clinical trials in children with irritable
      bowel syndrome: the Rome foundation pediatric subcommittee on clinical trials.
PG  - 1619-1631
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little published evidence of efficacy for the most commonly 
      used treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical trials on
      existing and novel therapies. PURPOSE: In order to address these issues the Rome 
      Foundation and members of the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines
      Agency formed a subcommittee on clinical trials to develop guidelines for the
      design of clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The
      following recommendations are based on evidence from published data when
      available and expert opinion. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: The subcommittee recommends
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials to 
      assess the efficacy of new drugs. The combined endpoints for abdominal pain are a
      decrease in intensity of at least 30% compared with baseline and to meet or
      exceed the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the sample. Stool consistency is
      measured with the Bristol Stool Scale Form (BSFS). The subcommittee recommends as
      entry criteria for abdominal pain a weekly average of worst abdominal pain in
      past 24 h of at least 3.0 on a 0-10 point scale or at least 30 mm in 100 mm
      Visual Analog Scale. For stool endpoints the committee recommends an average
      stool consistency lower than 3 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical 
      trials on IBS-C and an average stool consistency greater than 5 in the BSFS
      during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-D. Changes in stool
      consistency are the primary endpoints for both IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS 
      with constipation (IBS-C).

TI  - IBS-like Symptoms in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis in Deep Remission Are
      Associated with Increased Levels of Serum Cytokines and Poor Psychological
      Well-being.
PG  - 2630-2640
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms (GI) compatible with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. 
      The causes of these symptoms remain to be clarified. Our aim was to investigate
      prevalence and factors associated with IBS-like symptoms in patients with UC in
      deep remission. METHODS: We included 298 patients with UC and used Mayo score,
      sigmoidoscopy, and fecal calprotectin to define deep remission versus active
      disease. Presence of IBS-like symptoms according to the Rome III criteria,
      severity of GI, extraintestinal and psychological symptoms, stress levels, and
      quality of life were measured with validated questionnaires. Serum cytokines and 
      high-sensitive C-reactive peptide were determined. RESULTS: The criteria for deep
      remission was fulfilled by 132 patients (44%) and 24 of these fulfilled the Rome 
      III criteria for IBS (18%). Patients with UC in deep remission with IBS-like
      symptoms had comparable levels of GI symptoms, non-GI somatic symptoms, and
      quality of life as patients with active UC. The patients with UC in deep
      remission with IBS-like symptoms had similar levels of fecal calprotectin as
      patients in deep remission without IBS-like symptoms (18 versus 31 mug/g, P =
      0.11), but higher levels of serum cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-13,
      IL-10 and IL-8, P < 0.05) and higher levels of anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P
      = 0.02) and perceived stress (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-like symptoms in
      patients with UC in deep remission are common, but not as prevalent as previously
      reported. Poor psychological well-being and increased serum cytokine levels, but 
      not colonic low-grade inflammation, were associated with IBS-like symptoms.

      pediatric patients with functional constipation, functional abdominal pain (FAP),
      or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring
      stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble
      swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating,
      constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were identified as clinically important
      symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, and
      subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with
      overall HRQOL. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms were differentially associated 
      with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses for the three FGIDs. In predictive
      models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for age,
      gender, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms differentially accounted
      for an additional 47, 40, and 60 % of the variance in patient-reported HRQOL for 
      functional constipation, FAP, and IBS, respectively, reflecting large effect
      sizes. Significant individual gastrointestinal symptoms predictors were
      identified after controlling for the other gastrointestinal symptoms in the
      FGID-specific predictive models. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms represent
      potentially modifiable predictors of generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with
      FGIDs. Identifying the condition-specific gastrointestinal symptoms that are the 
      most important predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a
      patient-centered approach to targeted interventions designed to ameliorate
      impaired overall HRQOL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (P-FGIDs) have an increased risk for school absenteeism, depression, anxiety and 
      low quality of life. Exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has shown
      large treatment effects in adults with irritable bowel syndrome, but has not been
      tested for children 8-12 years with P-FGIDs. AIM: The aim of this trial was to
      test the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of a newly developed
      exposure-based CBT for children with P-FGIDs. METHOD: The children (n = 20) with 
      a P-FGID, were referred by their treating physicians. The participants received
      10 weekly sessions of exposure-based CBT and were assessed at pre-treatment,
      post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Children improved significantly on
      the primary outcome measure pain intensity at post (Cohen's d = 0.40, p = 0.049) 
      and at 6-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.85, p = 0.004). Improvements were also
      seen in pain frequency, gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, depression,
      anxiety, school absenteeism and somatic symptoms. Improvements were maintained or
      further increased at 6-month follow-up. The children engaged in the exposures and
      were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based CBT for children
      with P-FGIDs is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing the Low FODMAP Diet vs. Modified NICE
      Guidelines in US Adults with IBS-D.
PG  - 1824-1832

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There has been an increasing interest in the role of fermentable
      oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We report results from the first randomized controlled trial of
      the low FODMAP diet in US adults with IBS and diarrhea (IBS-D). The objectives
      were to compare the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet vs. a diet based upon
      modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines (mNICE) on 
      overall and individual symptoms in IBS-D patients. METHODS: This was a
      single-center, randomized-controlled trial of adult patients with IBS-D (Rome
      III) which compared 2 diet interventions. After a 2-week screening period,
      eligible patients were randomized to a low FODMAP or mNICE diet for 4 weeks. The 
      primary end point was the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of
      IBS-D symptoms >/=50% of intervention weeks 3-4. Secondary outcomes included a
      composite end point which required response in both abdominal pain (>/=30%
      reduction in mean daily pain score compared with baseline) and stool consistency 
      (decrease in mean daily Bristol Stool Form of >/=1 compared with baseline),
      abdominal pain and stool consistency responders, and other key individual IBS
      symptoms assessed using daily questionnaires. RESULTS: After screening, 92
      subjects (65 women, median age 42.6 years) were randomized. Eighty-four patients 
      completed the study (45 low FODMAP, 39 mNICE). Baseline demographics, symptom
      severity, and nutrient intake were similar between groups. Fifty-two percent of
      the low FODMAP vs. 41% of the mNICE group reported adequate relief of their IBS-D
      symptoms (P=0.31). Though there was no significant difference in the proportion
      of composite end point responders (P=0.13), the low FODMAP diet resulted in a
      higher proportion of abdominal pain responders compared with the mNICE group (51%
      vs. 23%, P=0.008). Compared with baseline scores, the low FODMAP diet led to
      greater reductions in average daily scores of abdominal pain, bloating,
      consistency, frequency, and urgency than the mNICE diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this US 
      trial, 40-50% of patients reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms with
      the low FODMAP diet or a diet based on modified NICE guidelines. The low FODMAP
      diet led to significantly greater improvement in individual IBS symptoms,
      particularly pain and bloating, compared with the mNICE diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have limited knowledge about the association between the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota and clinical features of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We collected information on the fecal and mucosa-associated
      microbiota of patients with IBS and evaluated whether these were associated with 
      symptoms. METHODS: We collected fecal and mucosal samples from adult patients who
      met the Rome III criteria for IBS at a secondary/tertiary care outpatient clinics
      in Sweden, as well as from healthy subjects. The exploratory set comprised 149
      subjects (110 with IBS and 39 healthy subjects); 232 fecal samples and 59 mucosal
      biopsy samples were collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA targeted
      pyrosequencing. The validation set comprised 46 subjects (29 with IBS and 17
      healthy subjects); 46 fecal samples, but no mucosal samples, were collected and
      analyzed. For each subject, we measured exhaled H2 and CH4, oro-anal transit
      time, and the severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal
      methanogens were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Numerical
      ecology analyses and a machine learning procedure were used to analyze the data. 
      RESULTS: Fecal microbiota showed covariation with mucosal adherent microbiota. By
      using classic approaches, we found no differences in fecal microbiota abundance
      or composition between patients with IBS vs healthy patients. A machine learning 
      procedure, a computational statistical technique, allowed us to reduce the 16S
      ribosomal RNA data complexity into a microbial signature for severe IBS,
      consisting of 90 bacterial operational taxonomic units. We confirmed the
      robustness of the intestinal microbial signature for severe IBS in the validation
      set. The signature was able to discriminate between patients with severe
      symptoms, patients with mild/moderate symptoms, and healthy subjects. By using
      this intestinal microbiota signature, we found IBS symptom severity to be
      associated negatively with microbial richness, exhaled CH4, presence of
      methanogens, and enterotypes enriched with Clostridiales or Prevotella species.
      This microbiota signature could not be explained by differences in diet or use of
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing fecal and mucosal microbiota from patients
      with IBS and healthy individuals, we identified an intestinal microbiota profile 
      that is associated with the severity of IBS symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

PG  - 476-84
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2016152 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder. Up to 96%
      of IBS patients experience bloating, resulting in poor response to conventional
      therapies and high consultation rates. Many IBS patients report that food
      triggers symptoms, particularly diets with poorly absorbed, short-chain
      carbohydrates, and restrict intake of certain foods to control their symptoms.
      IBS patients are especially susceptible to an attack due to visceral
      hypersensitivity. An emerging therapeutic strategy excludes fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) from the
      diet. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in improving
      symptoms of bloating in IBS patients. Individualised, structured dietary guidance
      may benefit those with persistent troublesome symptoms despite traditional
      therapies. In view of the multifactorial aetiology of the condition, it is
      probably best to use a multipronged approach, involving combination therapies, to
      address bloating in IBS patients.

TI  - Review on Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4: Functionality and Nutraceutical
      Applications as a Probiotic Microorganism.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17091544 [doi]
LID - E1544 [pii]
AB  - Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 is a probiotic strain that has been used as a major 
      ingredient to produce nutraceutical products and as a dairy starter since 2000.
      The various bio-functional effects and potential for industrial application of B.
      bifidum BGN4 has been characterized and proven by in vitro (i.e., phytochemical
      bio-catalysis, cell adhesion and anti-carcinogenic effects on cell lines, and
      immunomodulatory effects on immune cells), in vivo (i.e., suppressed allergic
      responses in mouse model and anti-inflammatory bowel disease), and clinical
      studies (eczema in infants and adults with irritable bowel syndrome). Recently,
      the investigation of the genome sequencing was finished and this data potentially
      clarifies the biochemical characteristics of B. bifidum BGN4 that possibly
      illustrate its nutraceutical functionality. However, further systematic research 
      should be continued to gain insight for academic and industrial applications so
      that the use of B. bifidum BGN4 could be expanded to result in greater benefit.
      This review deals with multiple studies on B. bifidum BGN4 to offer a greater
      understanding as a probiotic microorganism available in functional food
      ingredients. In particular, this work considers the potential for commercial
      application, physiological characterization and exploitation of B. bifidum BGN4
      as a whole.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of both pubertal development and sex to 
      childhood irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) clinical characteristics including
      gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain) and psychological factors. STUDY
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with children ages 7-17 years (n = 143) with a
      pediatric Rome III IBS diagnosis recruited from both primary and tertiary clinics
      between January 2009 and January 2014. Subjects completed 14-day prospective pain
      and stool diaries, as well as validated questionnaires assessing several
      psychological factors (somatization, depression, anxiety) and Tanner stage. Stool
      form ratings were completed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale. RESULTS: Girls
      with higher Tanner scores (more mature pubertal development) had both decreased
      pain severity and pain interference; in contrast, boys with higher Tanner scores 
      had both increasing pain severity (beta = 0.40, P = .02) and pain interference
      (beta = 0.16, P = .02). Girls (vs boys), irrespective of pubertal status, had
      both increased somatic complaints (P = .005) and a higher percentage (P = .01) of
      hard (Bristol Stool Form Scale type 1 or 2) stools. Pubertal status and sex did
      not significantly relate to IBS subtype, pain frequency, stooling frequency,
      anxiety, or depression. CONCLUSIONS: In children with IBS, both pubertal
      development and/or sex are associated with abdominal pain severity, stool form,
      and somatization. These differences provide insight into the role of pubertal
      maturation during the transition from childhood to adult IBS.

TI  - The feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of traditional paper food and
      symptom journals for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paper food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journals are used to
      help irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients determine potential trigger foods.
      The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and
      clinical utility of such journals as a data collection tool. A secondary aim was 
      to explore a method for analyzing journal data to describe patterns of diet and
      symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=17) were asked to log three sets of 3-day food
      and symptom journals over a 15-day period. Feasibility was evaluated by journal
      completion rates, symptom logging compliance, and logging fatigability. The
      feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of journaling were also assessed by 
      a customized evaluation and exit interview. For each journal, regression analyses
      were conducted to examine relationships between key meal nutrients and subsequent
      symptoms. KEY RESULTS: Most participants were young (mean age 35+/-12) Caucasian 
      (N=13) women (N=14). Journal completion rates were 100% for all participants with
      no logging fatigability. Over half perceived paper journaling of food and
      symptoms as feasible, usable, and clinically useful. Thirteen participants
      demonstrated a strong association with at least one symptom and meal nutrient.
      Patterns of associations differed among participants. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES:
      Paper journaling of food and GI symptoms for 9 days over a 15-day period appeared
      to be a feasible and usable data collection tool for IBS patients. Over half
      perceived journaling as at least somewhat clinically useful. Findings from this
      study support the anecdote that food trigger(s) and associated symptom(s) vary
      for each individual.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) has been found to significantly reduce symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet is best implemented in two phases: initial strict

TI  - Fecal incontinence in irritable bowel syndrome: Prevalence and associated factors
      in Swedish and American patients.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent but poorly recognized problem 
      in the general population with profound negative effects on daily life. The
      prevalence of FI in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its association with
      clinical, demographic, and pathophysiological factors remain largely unknown.
      METHODS: One US (n=304) and one Swedish (n=168) patient cohort fulfilling Rome
      III criteria for IBS completed Rome III diagnostic questions on FI and IBS
      symptoms, and questionnaires on IBS symptom severity, quality of life, anxiety
      and depression, and work productivity impairment. The patients also underwent
      assessments of colorectal sensitivity and motility. KEY RESULTS: Fecal
      incontinence >/= one day per month was reported by 19.7% (USA) and 13.7% (Sweden)
      of IBS patients. These proportions rose to 43.4% and 29.8% if patients with less 
      frequent FI were included. Fecal incontinence prevalence was higher in older age 
      groups, with a clear increase above age 40. Irritable bowel syndrome patients
      with FI reported greater overall IBS symptom severity, more frequent and loose
      stools, and greater urgency. Negative effects of FI on quality of life,
      psychological distress, and work productivity were demonstrated. No associations 
      were found between colorectal physiology and FI. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Fecal 
      incontinence is common in IBS patients, and similar to previous general
      population reports, the major risk factors for FI in IBS are older age, rectal
      urgency, and loose, frequent stools. When IBS patients have comorbid FI, the
      impact on quality of life, psychological symptoms, and work impairment appears
      greater.

      patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 693-703

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) is a 7-point scale used
      extensively in clinical practice and research for stool form measurement, which
      has undergone limited validity and reliability testing. AIM: To determine the
      validity and reliability of the BSFS in measuring stool form in healthy adults
      and patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).
      METHODS: One hundred and sixty-nine healthy volunteers provided a stool sample
      and used the BSFS to classify stool form, which was compared with measured stool 
      water content and with values from 19 patients with IBS-D. Eighty-six volunteers 
      used the BSFS to classify 26 stool models to determine accuracy and reliability. 
      RESULTS: Volunteers' classifications of stool type correlated with stool water
      (Spearman's rho = 0.491, P < 0.001), which increased in hard (Types 1-2), normal 
      (Types 3-5) and loose stools (Types 6-7) (P < 0.001). The BSFS detected
      differences in stool form between healthy volunteers (mean 3.7, s.d. 1.5) and
      IBS-D patients (mean 5.0, s.d. 1.2) (P < 0.001). Overall, 977/1204 (81%) stool
      models were correctly classified (substantial accuracy, kappa = 0.78), although
      <80% of Types 2, 3, 5 and 6 were classified correctly. On 852/1118 (76%)
      occasions, volunteers classified covert duplicate models to the same stool type
      (substantial reliability, kappa = 0.72), but with only moderate reliability for
      Types 2 (63%, kappa = 0.57) and 3 (62%, kappa = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: The BSFS
      demonstrated substantial validity and reliability, although difficulties arose
      around clinical decision points (Types 2, 3, 5, 6) that warrant investigation in 
      larger clinical populations. Potential for improving validity and reliability
      through modifications to the BSFS or training in its use should be explored.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The substantial characteristics of Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      (IBS) are associated with estrogens in women. Both soy isoflavones and vitamin D 
      can modulate estrogen receptors in the colonic smooth muscles. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones, vitamin D and their
      probable interactions in women with IBS. METHODS: In a factorial blinded
      randomized clinical trial, 100 women with IBS (age:18-75yr, were randomly
      assigned in 4 arms to receive either placebo of vitamin D and placebo of soy
      isoflavones (P+P), or placebo of vitamin D and soy isoflavones (P+S), or vitamin 
      D and placebo of soy isoflavones (D+P), or vitamin D and soy isoflavones (D+S)
      for 6 weeks. Dosage of soy isoflavone was 2 capsules of 20 mg soy isoflavones per
      day, and dosage of vitamin D was one pearl of 50'000 IU biweekly. The clinical
      outcomes were IBS symptoms severity scores (IBS-SSS), disease- specific quality
      of life (IBS-QOL) and total score (IBS-TS) that evaluated at weeks 0, 6, and 10, 
      and compared to each other. RESULTS: IBS-TS improved significantly in both S+P
      and D+P groups (p- value = 0.004, 0.015). The interaction effect of soy
      isoflavones and vitamin D on IBS-TS was significant (p<0.05). The interaction
      effect of soy isoflavones with vitamin D and the main effect of vitamin D on
      IBS-SSS were not statistically significant, whereas IBS-SSS decreased
      significantly in S+P and D+P groups (p-value = 0.001, 0.047 respectively).
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that co-administration of soy isoflavones with
      vitamin D did not improve the IBS- SSS and IBS- QOL; however, it improved the
      IBS-TS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT02026518.

TI  - Opioidergic effects on enteric and sensory nerves in the lower GI tract: basic
      mechanisms and clinical implications.
PG  - G501-13
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00442.2015 [doi]
AB  - Opioids are one of the most prescribed drug classes for treating acute pain.
      However, chronic use is often associated with tolerance as well as debilitating
      side effects, including nausea and dependence, which are mediated by the central 
      nervous system, as well as constipation emerging from effects on the enteric
      nervous system. These gastrointestinal (GI) side effects limit the usefulness of 
      opioids in treating pain in many patients. Understanding the mechanism(s) of
      action of opioids on the nervous system that shows clinical benefit as well as
      those that have unwanted effects is critical for the improvement of opioid drugs.
      The opioidergic system comprises three classical receptors (mu, delta, kappa) and
      a nonclassical receptor (nociceptin), and each of these receptors is expressed to
      varying extents by the enteric and intestinal extrinsic sensory afferent nerves. 
      The purpose of this review is to discuss the role that the opioidergic system has
      on enteric and extrinsic afferent nerves in the lower GI tract in health and
      diseases of the lower GI tract, particularly inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome, and the implications of opioid treatment on clinical
      outcomes. Consideration is also given to emerging developments in our
      understanding of the immune system as a novel source of endogenous opioids and
      the mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance, including the potential influence of 
      opioid receptor splice variants and heteromeric complexes.

TI  - Prevalence of overlap syndromes and symptoms in pediatric functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/s12876-016-0495-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose was to evaluate the overlap frequency of irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and overactive bladder
      syndrome (OBS), as well as other gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms, in
      functional dyspepsia (FD). Additionally, we sought to determine whether adult
      Rome III FD subtypes were uniquely related to overlap syndromes or symptoms.
      METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of 100 consecutive pediatric
      patients, age 8-17 years, diagnosed with FD. All had completed a standardized
      medical history including gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms as well as
      specific symptoms related to GERD and OBS. The frequency of overlap with IBS,
      GERD, and OBS were determined for the whole group and for those fulfilling adult 
      FD subtype criteria. Individual symptoms were also compared by FD subtype.
      RESULTS: Overlap IBS was present in 33 % of the FD patients. At least one GERD
      symptom was present in 74 % of patients with 41 % reporting heartburn. At least
      one OBS symptom was present in 44 % of patients with 29 % reporting urinary
      urgency. Other than pain, the most common reported gastrointestinal symptom was
      nausea (86 %). Systemic symptoms were common. Overlap syndromes/symptoms did not 
      vary by FD subtype. Postprandial distress syndrome was associated with pain with 
      eating, weight loss, and waking at night to have a stool. CONCLUSIONS: FD is a
      heterogeneous condition in children and adolescents with significant variability 
      in the presence of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms and overlap
      syndromes. Varying symptom profiles need to be accounted for and analyzed in
      studies involving subjects with FD.

TI  - Functional Dyspepsia: An Enigma in a Conundrum.
PG  - 579-584
AB  - As defined by Rome III, there are 4 abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders in children: irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia (FD), abdominal migraine, and functional abdominal pain. Dyspepsia is a
      constellation of symptoms referable to the gastroduodenal region of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract. FD refers to dyspeptic symptoms that cannot currently be 
      explained by an organic cause, and affects 25% to 40% of the adult population
      over a lifetime. In children, this condition results in increased specialist
      consultations, with reported prevalence between 3% and 27%. The Rome III criteria
      for pediatric FD include the presence or persistence of recurrent pain or
      discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, without evidence of organic disease or 
      change in frequency of stools. Symptoms must be chronic, occurring at least
      weekly and over a period of at least 6 months. The goal of this article is to
      provide a narrative review of diagnosis and management of the FD in the pediatric
      population. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed
      (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) database was carried out to identify all
      articles published in English from 1998 to November 2015, using 3 key terms;
      "FD," "functional gastrointestinal disorders," and "children."

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal parasites: a view from South America.
PG  - 153-8
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder of
      uncertain etiology. Several studies have proposed the possible role of intestinal
      parasites in the pathogenesis of IBS. We aimed to summarize the epidemiological
      studies that describe a possible link between intestinal parasites and IBS, with 
      special interest in endemic areas for intestinal parasitism such as South
      America. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted by using the
      keywords: irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal parasites, protozoan infection,
      soil-transmitted helminths and South America. Giardia lamblia may cause IBS
      symptoms that can persist several years after effective treatment. Dientamoeba
      fragilis can cause IBS-like symptoms, but low sensitive parasitological
      techniques may fail to detect it. Entamoeba histolytica can cause a chronic
      non-dysenteric colitis, but several studies have failed to find an association
      with IBS. The role of Blastocystis hominis in IBS remains controversial. In
      addition, epidemiological studies evaluating the effect of soil-transmitted
      helminths in IBS are scant. Symptoms elicited by intestinal parasites may
      resemble to those in IBS, especially in endemic areas such as South America,
      where both the prevalence of IBS and intestinal parasitism are high. Whether
      these organisms are the cause or contributing factors in IBS remains a subject of
      study. Routine parasitologicalexamination of stools in individuals who full-fit
      the criteria for IBS should be included upon initial assessment in endemic
      countries.

TI  - Challenges of Quantifying FODMAPs in Enteral Nutrition Formulas: Evaluation of
      Artifacts and Solutions.
PG  - 1262-1271
LID - 10.1177/0148607116658763 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea associated with enteral nutrition has been attributed to
      excessive FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides,
      and polyols) content of formulas. This study aimed to readdress their FODMAP
      content by measuring fermentation-specific effects after a formula load in
      healthy participants and by defining issues with analytical methods. METHODS:
      Breath hydrogen production expressed as mean area under the curve (AUC) for 12
      hours after ingestion of 15 g lactulose or 500 mL of 1 of 2 formulas of seemingly
      different FODMAP content was evaluated in a double crossover design.
      Quantification of specified FODMAPs via enzymatic and liquid chromatographic
      assays was assessed with additional controls to investigate the influence of
      maltodextrin and sucrose present in the formulas, and alternative assays were
      applied. RESULTS: In 15 hydrogen-producing participants, AUC following both
      formulas was minimal (</=21 ppm/12 h) compared with 15 g lactulose ( P < .001).
      Elevated breath hydrogen was detectable when >2.5 g fructo-oligosaccharide was
      consumed. Maltodextrin showed dose-dependent interference with enzymatic
      measurement of fructans and coeluted with raffinose with liquid chromatography.
      Application of an alternative fructan assay that includes additional enzymes to
      hydrolyze maltodextrins indicated that fructan content was <15% of that previous 
      reported. Galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) content could not be estimated by
      chromatography due to maltodextrins. An enzymatic assay, while overestimating GOS
      content, showed it to be very low. CONCLUSION: FODMAPs were not detected in
      enteral formulas in human bioassays, and their content may be grossly
      overestimated mainly due to high formula concentrations of maltodextrin. Better
      estimates of FODMAP content in enteral formulas can be made by alternative assay 
      approaches.

TI  - Celiac disease diagnosis still significantly delayed - Doctor's but not patients'
      delay responsive for the increased total delay in women.

LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2016.06.016 [doi]
LID - S1590-8658(16)30475-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is insufficient data on diagnostic delay and associated factors
      in celiac disease (CeD) as well as on its potential impact on the course of
      disease. METHODS: Specifically taking its two components - patients' and doctors'
      delay - into account, we performed a large systematic patient survey study among 
      unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: We found a mean/median total
      diagnostic delay of 87/24 months (IQR 5-96), with a range from 0 up to 780 months
      and roughly equal fractions of patients' and doctors' delay. Both mean/median
      total (93.1/24 vs. 60.2/12, p<0.001) and doctors' (41.8/3 vs. 23.9/2, p<0.001)
      diagnostic delay were significantly higher in female vs. male patients, whereas
      patients' delay was similar, regardless of preceding irritable bowel syndrome
      diagnosis. Patients with a diagnostic delay shorter than 2 years were
      significantly less often in need of steroids and/or immunosuppressants,
      substitution for any nutritional deficiency but more often free of symptoms 6 and
      12 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial diagnostic delay
      in CeD, which is associated with a worse clinical outcome and significantly
      longer in female patients. This increased diagnostic delay in women is due to
      doctors' but not patients' delay and cannot be explained by antecedent IBS prior 
      to establishing the CeD diagnosis.

TI  - Fatigue: a distressing symptom for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12898 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent symptom in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), and is associated with poor quality of life. However, few studies
      have evaluated its impact on daily life or the perceived distress it can cause.
      Using a multi-methods approach, this study describes the impact and
      manifestations of fatigue in patients with IBS and investigates the relationship 
      between fatigue severity and illness-related and health-promoting factors.
      METHODS: A total of 160 patients with IBS completed self-reported questionnaires 
      assessing fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological distress, and sense
      of coherence. Fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Impact Scale, which also
      includes structured and open-ended questions which were analyzed with a deductive
      qualitative analysis. Patients were classified as having severe, moderate, or
      mild fatigue based on frequency, distress and impact on daily life. KEY RESULTS: 
      The open-ended questions revealed a multidimensional impact on life. Fatigue
      mainly interfered with the ability to perform physical activities, work, and
      domestic work, and the ability to interact socially. Decreased stamina was
      evident, along with strategies to limit the bodily consequences of tiredness.
      Severe fatigue was accompanied by more severe IBS symptoms, anxiety and
      depression and lower sense of coherence. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Fatigue is a
      distressing symptom which occurs in a sizeable proportion of patients with IBS.
      It affects life in a multidimensional way, with poor bodily stamina being the
      most prominent feature. Fatigue, along with sense of coherence, depression and
      anxiety, needs to be assessed, confirmed and targeted for interventions.

TI  - Altered Ion Channel/Receptor Expression and Function in Extrinsic Sensory
      Neurons: The Cause of and Solution to Chronic Visceral Pain?
PG  - 75-90
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-27592-5_9 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is unique in that it is innervated by several distinct
      populations of neurons, whose cell bodies are either intrinsic (enteric,
      viscerofugal) or extrinsic (sympathetic, sensory afferents) to the wall of the
      gut. We are usually completely unaware of the continuous, complicated orchestra
      of functions that these neurons conduct. However, for patients with Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease (IBD) or functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as Functional 
      Dyspepsia (FD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) altered gastrointestinal
      motility, discomfort and pain are common, debilitating symptoms. Whilst bouts of 
      inflammation underlie the symptoms associated with IBD, over the past few years
      there is increased pre-clinical and clinical evidence that infection and
      inflammation are key risk factors for the development of several functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, in particular IBS. There is a strong correlation
      between prior exposure to gut infection and symptom occurrence; with the duration
      and severity of the initial illness the strongest associated risk factors. This
      review discusses the current body of evidence for neuroplasticity during
      inflammation and how in many cases fails to reset back to normal, long after
      healing of the damaged tissues. Recent evidence suggests that the altered
      expression and function of key ion channels and receptors within extrinsic
      sensory neurons play fundamental roles in the aberrant pain sensation associated 
      with these gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and clinical features of small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS-D) patients detected by hydrogen and methane in lactulose breath
      test (LBT), and to study the effects of rifaximin in IBS-D patients. METHODS:
      Consecutive patients with IBS-D who met Rome criteria, and gender- and
      age-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled from March 2015 to January 2016 in
      Peking University Third Hospital. All the ISB-D patients underwent LBT to detect 
      the prevalence of SIBO. The clinical and LBT features of IBS with SIBO (IBS-P
      group) and without SIBO (IBS-N group) were analyzed. The effects of rifaximin
      therapy (0.4 g, twice per day for 4 weeks) in IBS-D patients were evaluated by
      comparing changes in clinical features and LBT results after treatment. RESULTS: 
      (1) Eighty-four IBS-D patients and 22 healthy controls were enrolled. The
      prevalence of SIBO in IBS-D patients was 41.67% (35/84), with 27 (77.14%) only
      hydrogen-positive, 5 (14.29%) methane-positive, and 3 (8.57%) both methane- and
      hydrogen-positive. (2) The body mass index (BMI) in the IBS-P group was lower
      than in the IBS-N group [(21.61+/-0.57) vs (23.44+/-0.54) kg/m(2,) P<0.05], the
      maximum stool frequency was also less than in the IBS-N group [(3.85+/-0.23) vs
      (4.88+/-0.35) times/day, P<0.05]. (3) No significant difference was found in
      oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) among IBS-P, IBS-N and healthy controls. The
      hydrogen concentration in small intestinal and colonic sections in breath of the 
      IBS-P group was higher than that of both healthy controls and the IBS-N group,
      while methane concentration in small intestinal and colonic sections (160 min)
      was higher than that of the IBS-N group (all P<0.05). (4) There was no linear
      relationship between mean hydrogen and methane concentrations in LBT among the
      IBS-P, the IBS-N and healthy control groups (all r<0.35, P>0.05). (5) Totally 13 
      IBS-P patients received rifaximin therapy, in whom the symptoms of abdomen pain, 
      bloating, fecal consistency, stool frequency, and stool satisfactory were
      significantly improved after treatment (all P<0.05); 8 IBS-N patients received
      rifaximin therapy, in whom fecal consistency, stool frequency, and satisfactory
      were significantly improved (all P<0.05). (6) And 5/13 of the IBS-P patients
      receiving rifaximin presented negative LBT results after rifaximin therapy, with 
      lower hydrogen concentration at all the time points, especially in colonic
      section (120 min) [(34.54+/-7.32) x10(-6) vs (52.23+/-9.40) x10(-6,) P<0.05] and 
      lower methane concentration especially in small intestinal section (80 min)
      [(8.54+/-0.95) x10(-6) vs (11.31+/-0.94) x10(-6,) P<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: About
      41.67% of the IBS-D patients meeting Rome criteria have SIBO, which can be better
      screened by combining hydrogen and methane in LBT compared with only hydrogen in 
      LBT. SIBO can affect nutritional status in IBS-D patients. Rifaximin can improve 
      the systematic symptoms of IBS-D patients with SIBO, also reduce hydrogen and
      methane concentration in breath, while only improving diarrhea in IBS-D patients 
      without SIBO. Some differences in gut microbiota may exist between IBS-D with and
      without SIBO.

TI  - Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome report increased eating-associated
      symptoms, changes in dietary composition, and altered eating behaviors: a pilot
      comparison study to healthy adolescents.
PG  - 1915-1920
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About half of adult irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report
      symptoms with eating and disordered eating habits. However, little is known about
      eating in adolescent IBS patients, a common age at which eating disorders
      develop. The aim of the study was to investigate if adolescents with IBS are more
      likely than healthy controls (HCs) to experience eating-associated symptoms
      (EAS), report disordered eating patterns, and show differences in diet
      composition. METHODS: A total of 99 adolescents between 15 and 21 years-of-age
      participated (n = 48 IBS; n = 51 HCs). All subjects completed three 24-h dietary 
      recalls and questionnaires on EAS and disordered eating. KEY RESULTS: IBS
      patients were more likely to report EASs than HC (91.7% vs 28%, p < 0.001).
      Eating-associated symptoms were controlled by avoiding the offending food
      (97.7%), not eating any food even when hungry (43.2%), or vomiting after eating
      (13.6%). Compared to HC, IBS patients reported reduced daily intake of overall
      calories (1828 vs 2139; p < 0.05), fat (65.4 g vs 81.4 g, p < 0.05), and lactose 
      (8.2 g vs 12.8 g, p < 0.01). No differences were found between IBS and HC in
      screening for disordered eating patterns or BMI, though IBS patients endorsed
      using potentially unhealthy eating behaviors in an attempt to control symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Eating-associated symptoms are very common in
      adolescents with IBS and associated with changes in eating behaviors and dietary 
      composition. They do not appear to change BMI and risk for eating disorders. More
      research is needed to guide adolescents with IBS in making appropriate dietary
      changes to control EASs.

TI  - Nonceliac gluten sensitivity: an approach to diagnosis and management.
PG  - 638-43
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000392 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Symptoms attributed to gluten consumption are frequently
      reported evoking the need for differentiating nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)
      from other gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and wheat allergy.
      This review discusses diagnostic criteria and research to date on the
      pathogenesis and diagnosis of NCGS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is recent evidence to 
      support NCGS as a distinct clinical entity. The symptoms attributed to NCGS are
      nonspecific, overlapping with those reported in patients with celiac disease and 
      irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast to celiac disease and wheat allergy, the
      diagnosis of NCGS is more challenging because there are no specific clinical
      biomarkers and because the pathogenesis of NCGS is largely not well understood.
      The pathogenesis of NCGS may reflect alterations in innate immunity to gluten or 
      other components of wheat, may be linked with autoimmunity, or is a result of a
      reaction to gluten as a fermentable carbohydrate. SUMMARY: NCGS is a newly
      characterized and evolving clinical entity that requires ruling out other causes 
      of wheat-related or gluten-related gastrointestinal symptoms, including celiac
      disease and wheat allergy, coupled with double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
      challenge with gluten.

TI  - Dietary patterns and prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in Iranian adults.
PG  - 1921-1933
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several dietary factors have been reported to alleviate or
      aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), no information is
      available linking habitual dietary patterns to irritable bowel syndrome.
      OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the association between dietary
      patterns and the risk of IBS among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, data on 3846 Iranian adults working in 50 different health
      centers were examined. Dietary intake of study participants was assessed using a 
      106-item self-administered Dish-based Semi-quantitative Food Frequency
      Questionnaire (DS-FFQ) which was designed and validated specifically for Iranian 
      adults. To identify major dietary patterns based on the 39 food groups, we used
      principal component analysis. A modified Persian version of the Rome III
      questionnaire was used for assessment of IBS. RESULTS: We identified four major
      dietary patterns: (i) 'fast food', (ii) 'traditional', (iii) 'lacto-vegetarian', 
      and (iv) 'western' dietary pattern. After adjustment for potential confounders,
      we found that those in the highest quartile of 'fast food' dietary pattern were
      tended to have higher risk of IBS than those in the lowest quartile (OR = 1.32;
      95% CI: 0.99, 1.75, ptrend = 0.05). An inverse association was also found between
      'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern and risk of IBS; such that even after
      adjustment for potential confounders, those in top quartile of this dietary
      pattern were 24% less likely to have IBS (0.76; 0.59, 0.98; ptrend = 0.02). No
      overall significant associations were observed between 'traditional' and
      'western' dietary patterns and risk of IBS, either before or after adjustment for
      covariates. CONCLUSION: We found that 'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern was
      associated with reduced risk, while 'fast food' dietary pattern was associated
      with a greater risk of IBS in Iranian adults.

TI  - Phenotyping of subjects for large scale studies on patients with IBS.
PG  - 1134-47
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12886 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex condition with multiple
      factors contributing to its aetiology and pathophysiology. Aetiologically these
      include genetics, life-time events and environment, and physiologically, changes 
      in motility, central processing, visceral sensitivity, immunity, epithelial
      permeability and gastrointestinal microflora. Such complexity means there is
      currently no specific reliable biomarker for IBS, and thus IBS continues to be
      diagnosed and classified according to symptom based criteria, the Rome Criteria. 
      Carefully phenotyping and characterisation of a 'large' pool of IBS patients
      across Europe and even the world however, might help identify sub-populations
      with accuracy and consistency. This will not only aid future research but improve
      tailoring of treatment and health care of IBS patients. PURPOSE: The aim of this 
      position paper is to discuss the requirements necessary to standardize the
      process of selecting and phenotyping IBS patients and how to organise the
      collection and storage of patient information/samples in such a large
      multi-centre pan European/global study. We include information on general
      demographics, gastrointestinal symptom assessment, psychological factors, quality
      of life, physiological evaluation, genetic/epigenetic and microbiota analysis,
      biopsy/blood sampling, together with discussion on the organisational, ethical
      and language issues associated with implementing such a study. The proposed
      approach and documents selected to be used in such a study was the result of a
      thoughtful and thorough four-year dialogue amongst experts associated with the
      European COST action BM1106 GENIEUR (www.GENIEUR.eu).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently identify foods 
      as exacerbating their gastrointestinal symptoms. In children with IBS, the
      prevalence of perceived food intolerances and their impact are unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of self-perceived food
      intolerances and the relationship of these intolerances to abdominal pain,
      psychosocial distress, and quality of life in children with IBS. DESIGN: We
      conducted a cross-sectional study. Questionnaire and prospective diary data were 
      collected from 2008 to 2014 by trained research coordinators.
      PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were children 7 to 18 years old (pediatric
      Rome III IBS, n=154; age-sex matched healthy children, n=32) in Houston, TX.
      MEASURES: Perceived food intolerances and avoided foods were captured using the
      Childhood Food and Symptom Association Questionnaire. IBS severity was assessed
      by a >/=7-day pain diary and validated psychosocial questionnaires assessing
      quality of life, somatization, functional disability, depression, and anxiety.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: We used descriptive Spearman bivariate
      correlation, chi(2), and Poisson log-linear generalized model with Wald chi(2)
      statistics. RESULTS: A greater proportion of children with IBS (143 of 154
      [92.9%]) vs healthy children (20 of 32 [62.5%]) identified at least one
      self-perceived food intolerance (chi(2)=22.5; P<0.001). Children with IBS
      identified a greater number (median=4 [25% to 75% quartile=2 to 6]) of perceived 
      symptom-inducing foods than healthy children (median=2 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to 
      4]; chi(2)=28.6; P<0.001). Children with IBS avoided more foods (median=2 [25% to
      75% quartile=1 to 4]) than healthy children (median=0 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to
      2.75]; chi(2)=20.8; P<0.001). The number of self-perceived food intolerances was 
      weakly associated (r value range= -0.17 to 0.21) with pain frequency, pain
      severity, somatization, anxiety, functional disability, and decreased quality of 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBS have a high prevalence of self-perceived
      food intolerances. The number of these intolerances is weakly associated with
      measures of IBS severity.

TI  - British Dietetic Association systematic review and evidence-based practice
      guidelines for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016
      update).
PG  - 549-75
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines for the
      dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults were published in 
      2012. Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this work
      was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the management 
      of IBS and to update the guidelines. METHODS: Twelve questions relating to diet
      and IBS were defined based on review of the previous guideline questions, current
      evidence and clinical practice. Chosen topics were on healthy eating and
      lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, elimination diets, fat and fluid
      intakes and dietary habits), milk and dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable
      carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and elimination diets/food hypersensitivity.
      Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase,
      Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to October 2015. Studies were assessed
      independently in duplicate using risk of bias tools specific to each included
      study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for each question. National
      Health and Medical Research Council grading evidence levels were used to develop 
      evidence statements and recommendations, in accordance with Practice-based
      Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the BDA. RESULTS: Eighty-six
      studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence statements, 15 clinical
      recommendations and four research recommendations. The IBS dietary algorithm was 
      simplified to first-line (healthy eating, provided by any healthcare
      professional) and second-line [low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) to be provided by dietitian] dietary 
      advice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide updated comprehensive
      evidence-based details to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS in
      adults.

TI  - Global Cytokine Profiles and Association With Clinical Characteristics in
      Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 1165-76
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.223 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      have an altered cytokine profile, although it is unclear whether cytokines are
      linked with symptom severity. We aimed to determine whether global serum and
      mucosal cytokine profiles differ between IBS patients and healthy subjects and
      whether cytokines are associated with IBS symptoms. METHODS: Serum from 144 IBS
      patients and 42 healthy subjects was analyzed for cytokine levels of interleukin 
      (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by MSD MULTI-ARRAY. In total, 109 IBS and 36 healthy 
      sigmoid colon biopsies were analyzed for mRNA expression of IL-8, IL-10, TNF, and
      FOXP3 by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Multivariate discrimination
      analysis evaluated global cytokine profiles. Rectal sensitivity, oroanal transit 
      time, and psychological and gastrointestinal symptom severity were also assessed.
      RESULTS: Global cytokine profiles of IBS patients and healthy subjects
      overlapped, but cytokine levels varied more in IBS patients. Serum levels of IL-6
      and IL-8 tended to be increased and levels of IFN-gamma tended to be decreased in
      IBS patients. Mucosal mRNA expression of IL-10 and FOXP3 tended to be decreased
      in IBS patients. Within both the full study cohort and IBS patients alone, serum 
      level of TNF was associated with looser stool pattern, while subjects with more
      widespread somatic symptoms had increased serum levels of IL-6. Although neither 
      IBS bowel habit subgroups nor patients with possible post-infectious IBS were
      associated with distinct cytokine profiles, a small cluster of IBS patients with 
      comparatively elevated immune markers was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Global
      cytokine profiles did not discriminate IBS patients from healthy subjects, but
      cytokine profiles were more varied among IBS patients than among healthy
      subjects, and a small subgroup of patients with enhanced immune activity was
      identified. Also, association of inflammatory cytokines with some clinical
      symptoms suggests that immune activation may be of importance in a subset of IBS 
      patients.

TI  - British Dietetic Association systematic review of systematic reviews and
      evidence-based practice guidelines for the use of probiotics in the management of
      irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016 update).
PG  - 576-92
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are often taken by individuals with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Which products are effective is unclear, despite an increasing
      research base. This project will systematically review which strain- and dose-
      specific probiotics can be recommended to adults with IBS to improve symptoms and
      quality of life (QoL). It is part of a broader systematic review to update
      British Dietetic Association guidelines for the dietary management of IBS in
      adults. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science
      were searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trial (RCT)s 
      recruiting adults with IBS comparing probiotic intervention with placebo. AMSTAR,
      risk of bias and diet bias tools were used to appraise methodological quality.
      Symptom and QoL data were appraised to develop probiotic-specific evidence
      statements on clinically meaningful and marginal outcomes in various settings,
      graded clinical practice recommendations and practical considerations. RESULTS:
      Nine systematic reviews and 35 RCTs were included (3406 participants) using 29
      dose-specific probiotic formulations. None of the RCTs were at low risk of bias. 
      Twelve out of 29 probiotics (41%) showed no symptom or QoL benefits. Evidence
      indicated that no strain or dose specific probiotic was consistently effective to
      improve any IBS symptoms or QoL. Two general clinical practice recommendations
      were made. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom outcomes for dose-specific probiotics were
      heterogeneous. Specific probiotic recommendations for IBS management in adults
      were not possible at this time. More data from high-quality RCTs treating
      specific symptom profiles are needed to support probiotic therapy in the
      management of IBS.

PG  - 26420
LID - 10.1038/srep26420 [doi]
AB  - Biological markers that measure gut health and diagnose functional
      gastro-intestinal (GI) disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are
      lacking. The objective was to identify and validate a biomarker panel associated 
      with the pathophysiology of IBS that discriminates IBS from healthy controls
      (HC), and correlates with GI symptom severity. In a case-control design, various 
      plasma and fecal markers were measured in a cohort of 196 clinical IBS patients
      and 160 HC without GI symptoms. A combination of biomarkers, which best
      discriminates between IBS and HC was identified and validated in an independent
      internal validation set and by permutation testing. The correlation between the
      biomarker panel and GI symptom severity was tested in IBS patients and in a
      general population cohort of 958 subjects. A set of 8 biomarker panel was
      identified to discriminate IBS from HC with high sensitivity (88.1%) and
      specificity (86.5%). The results for the IBS subtypes were comparable. Moreover, 
      a moderate correlation was found between the biomarker panel and GI symptom
      scores in the IBS (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and the general population cohorts (r =
      0.51, p = 0.003). A novel multi-domain biomarker panel has been identified and
      validated, which correlated moderately to GI symptom severity in IBS and general 
      population subjects.

TI  - Patients' experiences of healthcare encounters in severe irritable bowel
      syndrome: an analysis based on narrative and feminist theory.
PG  - 2967-78
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13400 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore patients' experiences of
      healthcare encounters in severe irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND: Irritable
      bowel syndrome is a common functional disorder with symptoms such as abdominal
      pain and disturbed bowel habits, the cause of which is not completely known.
      Treatments options are limited, and healthcare encounters in irritable bowel
      syndrome have been described as unsatisfying and frustrating for both patients
      and professional healthcare providers. Furthermore, the influence of power on
      healthcare encounters has long been recognised, especially regarding the
      disadvantaged position of those suffering from functional illness which cannot be
      identified by commonly used tests or investigations. METHODS: We interviewed 10
      patients during 2014, all attending an outpatient clinic and suffering from
      severe irritable bowel syndrome. Relying on narrative and feminist theory, we
      explored how they actively negotiate professional discourse communicated to them 
      in the clinical encounter. RESULTS: The patients' experiences of healthcare
      encounters in irritable bowel syndrome were mostly described as negative, and
      often induced feelings of confusion and self-doubt. Positive encounters were
      described as being listened to, believed and taken seriously. Narrators found it 
      especially problematic when healthcare professionals described irritable bowel
      syndrome as a minor disorder with primarily stress or psychological aetiology and
      put the responsibility for recovery onto the patient. Patients' actively
      negotiated such professional discourse by presenting a counternarrative
      describing their own suffering and strengths, experienced healthcare shortcomings
      and possible organic aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      suffering from severe irritable bowel syndrome described how they often felt a
      need to protect their positive identities in the face of trivialisation and
      disbelief by healthcare professionals. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A deepened
      understanding of patients' experiences of healthcare encounters in irritable
      bowel syndrome could enable more helpful and supporting interventions by
      healthcare professionals.

TI  - Biomarkers to distinguish functional constipation from irritable bowel syndrome
      with constipation.
PG  - 783-92
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12852 [doi]
AB  - Treatments for functional constipation (FC) and irritable bowel syndrome with
      constipation (IBS-C) differ, but symptom criteria do not reliably distinguish
      between them; some regard FC and IBS-C as parts of a single constipation
      spectrum. Our goal was to review studies comparing FC and IBS-C to identify
      possible biomarkers that separate them. A systematic review identified 15 studies
      that compared physiologic tests in FC vs IBS-C. Pain thresholds were lower in
      IBS-C than FC for 3/5 studies and not different in 2/5. Colonic motility was
      decreased more in FC than IBS-C for 3/3 studies, and whole gut transit was
      delayed more in FC than IBS-C in 3/8 studies and not different in 5/8. Pelvic
      floor dyssynergia was unrelated to diagnosis. Sympathetic arousal, measured in
      only one study, was greater in IBS-C than FC. The most reliable separation of FC 
      from IBS-C was shown by a novel new magnetic resonance imaging technique
      described in this issue of the journal. These authors showed that drinking one
      liter of polyethylene glycol laxative significantly increased water content in
      the small intestine, volume of contents in the ascending colon, and time to first
      evacuation in FC vs IBS-C; and resulted in less colon motility and delayed whole 
      gut transit in FC compared to IBS-C. Although replication is needed, this
      well-tolerated, non-invasive test promises to become a new standard for
      differential diagnosis of FC vs IBS-C. These data suggest that FC and IBS-C are
      different disorders rather than points on a constipation spectrum.

TI  - Is There a Role for the Enteral Administration of Serum-Derived Immunoglobulins
      in Human Gastrointestinal Disease and Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition?
PG  - 535-43
LID - 10.3945/an.115.011924 [doi]
AB  - Twenty years ago, there was profound, international interest in developing oral
      human, bovine, or chicken egg-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) for the prevention and 
      nutritional treatment of childhood malnutrition and gastrointestinal disease,
      including acute diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. Although such Ig products
      were shown to be effective, with both nutritional and antidiarrheal benefits,
      interest waned because of their cost and because of the perceived risk of bovine 
      serum encephalitis (BSE). BSE is no longer considered a barrier to use of oral
      Ig, because the WHO has declared the United States to be BSE-free since the early
      2000s. Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed 
      and are regulated as medical foods. These new products, called serum bovine Igs
      (SBIs), facilitate the management of chronic or severe gastrointestinal
      disturbances in both children and adults and are regulated by the US Food and
      Drug Administration. Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could
      potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other
      conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control
      without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in
      conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could
      potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for 
      their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential 
      process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, 
      thereby leading to intestinal inflammation. Thus, oral Ig may emerge as an
      important "add-on" therapy for a variety of gastrointestinal and nutritional
      problems during the next decade.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 16014
LID - 10.1038/nrdp.2016.14 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disease with a
      high population prevalence. The disorder can be debilitating in some patients,
      whereas others may have mild or moderate symptoms. The most important single risk
      factors are female sex, younger age and preceding gastrointestinal infections.
      Clinical symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain or discomfort, stool
      irregularities and bloating, as well as other somatic, visceral and psychiatric
      comorbidities. Currently, the diagnosis of IBS is based on symptoms and the
      exclusion of other organic diseases, and therapy includes drug treatment of the
      predominant symptoms, nutrition and psychotherapy. Although the underlying
      pathogenesis is far from understood, aetiological factors include increased
      epithelial hyperpermeability, dysbiosis, inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity,
      epigenetics and genetics, and altered brain-gut interactions. IBS considerably
      affects quality of life and imposes a profound burden on patients, physicians and
      the health-care system. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in our
      understanding of functional bowel disorders such as IBS that will be summarized
      in this Primer.

TI  - Effect of vitamin D on gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related quality of
      life in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a randomized double-blind clinical
      trial.
PG  - 1533-44
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12851 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-grade mucosal inflammation and immune activation are involved in 
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, IBS symptoms are
      associated with a significantly higher prevalence of psychological distress,
      which in itself results into an impaired quality of life (QoL). Vitamin D could
      ameliorate the symptoms of patients suffering from IBS through its beneficial
      effects on psychological factors and inflammation. METHODS: A total of 90 IBS
      patients participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomly selected to receive either 50 000 IU vitamin D3 or a
      placebo fortnightly for a period of 6 months. Patients reported their IBS
      symptoms at the baseline and monthly during intervention periods. The IBS
      severity score system (IBSSS) and IBS-specific QoL questionnaires were used at
      the baseline and postintervention. KEY RESULTS: Over the 6-month intervention
      period, a significantly greater improvement in IBS symptoms such as abdominal
      pain and distention, flatulence, rumbling, and overall gastrointestinal (GI)
      symptoms (except dissatisfaction with bowel habits) was observed in the patients 
      receiving vitamin D as compared to the placebo group. The IBSSS and the IBS-QoL
      scores in the vitamin D group significantly improved compared to the placebo
      group postintervention (mean IBSSS score change: -53.82 +/- 23.3 vs -16.85 +/-
      25.01, p < 0.001, respectively; mean IBS-QoL score change: 14.26 +/- 3 vs 11 +/- 
      2.34, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Vitamin D seems to be
      an effective and safe option to improve QoL and symptoms of IBS.

TI  - Volatile organic compounds in breath as markers for irritable bowel syndrome: a
      metabolomic approach.
PG  - 45-56
LID - 10.1111/apt.13654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is challenging
      because of its heterogeneity and multifactorial pathophysiology. No reliable
      biomarkers of IBS have been identified so far. AIMS: In a case-control study,
      using a novel application of breath analysis to distinguish IBS patients from
      healthy controls based on the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
      Subsequently, the diagnostic VOC-biomarker set was correlated with self-reported 
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of subjects of the Maastricht IBS clinical cohort 
      and of a general population cohort, LifeLines DEEP. METHODS: Breath samples were 
      collected from 170 IBS patients and 153 healthy controls in the clinical cohort
      and from 1307 participants in general population cohort. Multivariate statistics 
      were used to identify the most discriminatory set of VOCs in the clinical cohort,
      and to find associations between VOCs and GI symptoms in both cohorts. RESULTS: A
      set of 16 VOCs correctly predicted 89.4% of the IBS patients and 73.3% of the
      healthy controls (AUC = 0.83). The VOC-biomarker set correlated moderately with a
      set of GI symptoms in the clinical (r = 0.55, P = 0.0003) and general population 
      cohorts (r = 0.54, P = 0.0004). A Kruskal-Wallis test showed no influence from
      possible confounding factors in distinguishing IBS patients from healthy
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: A set of 16 breath-based biomarkers that distinguishes IBS
      patients from healthy controls was identified. The VOC-biomarker set correlated
      significantly with GI symptoms in two independent cohorts. We demonstrate the
      potential use of breath analysis in the diagnosis and monitoring of IBS, and a
      possible application of VOC analyses in a general population cohort.

TI  - Frankincense--therapeutic properties.
PG  - 380-91
AB  - Recently, increasing interest in natural dietary and therapeutic preparations
      used as dietary supplements has been observed. One of them is frankincense. This 
      traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory,
      expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The
      present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia
      resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific
      studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%)
      and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl acetate (21.4%), octyl acetate (13.4%) and 
      methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is
      characteristic of 11-keto-ss-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid,
      acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid. Contemporary
      studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and
      anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties,
      extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be
      particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of
      rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans.
      Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of
      leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of
      Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have 
      an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour
      cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect
      since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell
      death (apoptosis).

TI  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease, and the relationship with biochemical markers of
      disease activity.
PG  - 181-8
LID - 10.1111/apt.13636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease
      in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to
      reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms
      in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the
      relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity.
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of 
      three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity
      was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity
      was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed 
      using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184
      patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative
      colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease:
      4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children
      with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's
      disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin 
      or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type 
      symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12;
      CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence 
      of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly
      dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much
      lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - Approach to a Child with Functional Abdominal Pain.
PG  - 1452-1458
LID - 10.1007/s12098-016-2111-5 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is one of the most common functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) of childhood. Only a minority of patients with
      FAP seek medical attention, often presenting to the primary care physician while 
      symptoms are still evolving. The bio-psychosocial model of treatment not only
      aims to alleviate the illness symptoms but also identifies and remedies the
      psychological comorbidities and social factors that contribute to illness
      behavior. Many patients with a mild illness can be managed in the primary care
      setting. However those with chronic, severe, frequently relapsing, and disabling 
      illness usually are referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. One of the reason
      for referral is to exclude organic disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, celiac
      disease or inflammatory bowel disease which can present with chronic abdominal
      pain. Recent data suggest that psychological therapy is very effective in
      alleviating symptoms, a subset of patients may require dietary modification and
      medications as an adjunct to psychological treatment.

TI  - A Simple Dietary Questionnaire Correlates With Formal Dietitian Evaluation and
      Frequently Identifies Specific Clinical Interventions in an Outpatient
      Gastroenterology Clinic.
PG  - e71-6
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum of gastroenterology-related diseases related to obesity 
      is growing. Few clinical tools exist to aid in clinician-guided dietary
      counseling. GOALS: (1) Develop and validate a 1-page diet history form that would
      provide information on dietary factors that can contribute to gastrointestinal
      (GI) illness and to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet; and (2) evaluate 
      the form in a general GI clinic to determine its potential utility as a clinical 
      tool. STUDY: A 1-page diet history form was developed and underwent qualitative
      and quantitative validation in comparison to a formal diet evaluation by a
      registered dietitian. The form was then evaluated in consecutive patients
      attending a general GI clinic, and analyzed for overall diet content, compliance 
      with a Mediterranean diet, and presence of high-risk (red flag) dietary
      behaviors. RESULTS: The form was evaluated in 134 patients. In a validation
      cohort (n=30) the qualitative dietary components measured were highly concordant 
      with a formal dietary interview. Total daily calorie intake correlated with
      formal dietary review (R=0.61), but tended to underestimate total calories due to
      less precision in portion size. The prospective cohort (n=104) patients had a
      mean body mass index of 29.8. Overall, 52.9% were obese, 50% had metabolic
      syndrome, and 51% had a primary GI illness directly impacted by dietary factors
      (gastroesophageal reflux, irritable bowel, fatty liver). Overall, 85.6% of
      patients documented red flag behaviors. Patients with obesity trended for more
      red flags than overweight or normal body mass index groups. CONCLUSION: A 1-page 
      diet questionnaire correlated well with formal dietary assessment and identified 
      clinically relevant dietary interventions in a high percentage of GI patients.

TI  - Psyllium Fiber Reduces Abdominal Pain in Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      in a Randomized, Double-Blind Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to determine the efficacy of psyllium fiber
      treatment on abdominal pain and stool patterns in children with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We evaluated effects on breath hydrogen and methane production,
      gut permeability, and microbiome composition. We also investigated whether
      psychological characteristics of children or parents affected the response to
      treatment. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of 103 children
      (mean age, 13 +/- 3 y) with IBS seen at primary or tertiary care settings. After 
      2 weeks on their habitual diet, children began an 8-day diet excluding
      carbohydrates thought to cause symptoms of IBS. Children with >/=75% improvement 
      in abdominal pain were excluded (n = 17). Children were assigned randomly to
      groups given psyllium (n = 37) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 47) for 6 weeks.
      Two-week pain and stool diaries were compared at baseline and during the final 2 
      weeks of treatment. We assessed breath hydrogen and methane production,
      intestinal permeability, and the composition of the microbiome before and after
      administration of psyllium or placebo. Psychological characteristics of children 
      were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Children in the psyllium group had a greater 
      reduction in the mean number of pain episodes than children in the placebo group 
      (mean reduction of 8.2 +/- 1.2 after receiving psyllium vs mean reduction of 4.1 
      +/- 1.3 after receiving placebo; P = .03); the level of pain intensity did not
      differ between the groups. Psychological characteristics were not associated with
      response. At the end of the study period, the percentage of stools that were
      normal (Bristol scale scores, 3-5), breath hydrogen or methane production,
      intestinal permeability, and microbiome composition were similar between groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium fiber reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes in
      children with IBS, independent of psychological factors. Psyllium did not alter
      breath hydrogen or methane production, gut permeability, or microbiome
      composition. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00526903.

LID - 10.1111/nmo.12829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) physiopathology is multifactorial and 
      roles for both microbiota and bile acid (BA) modifications have been proposed. We
      investigated role of dysbiosis, transit pattern and BA metabolism in IBS.
      METHODS: Clinical data, serum, and stool samples were collected in 15 healthy
      subjects (HS), 16 diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and 15 constipation-predominant
      IBS (IBS-C). Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by real-time PCR. Sera and
      fecal BA profiles, 7alpha-C4 levels, and in vitro BA transformation activity by
      fecal microbiota were measured by mass spectrometry. Serum Fibroblast Growth
      Factor 19 (FGF19) was assayed by ELISA. KEYS RESULTS: Dysbiosis was present in
      IBS patients with an increase in Escherichia coli in IBS-D patients (p = 0.03),
      and an increase in Bacteroides (p = 0.01) and Bifidobacterium (p = 0.04) in IBS-C
      patients. Sera primary and amino-conjugated BA were increased in IBS-D (63.5 +/- 
      5.5%, p = 0.01 and 78.9 +/- 6.3%, p = 0.03) and IBS-C patients (55.9 +/- 5.5%, p 
      = 0.04 and 65.3 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.005) compared to HS (37.0 +/- 5.8% and 56.7 +/-
      8.1%). Serum 7alpha-C4 and FGF19 levels were not different among all three
      groups. Fecal primary BA were increased in IBS-D patients compared to HS,
      including chenodeoxycholic acid which has laxative properties (25.6 +/- 8.5% vs
      3.5 +/- 0.6%, p = 0.005). Bile acid deconjugation activity was decreased in IBS-D
      (p = 0.0001) and IBS-C (p = 0.003) feces. Abdominal pain was positively
      correlated with serum (R = 0.635, p < 0.001) and fecal (R = 0.391, p = 0.024)
      primary BA. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Different sera and fecal BA profiles in IBS
      patients could be secondary to dysbiosis and further differences between IBS-C
      and IBS-D could explain stool patterns. This study opens new fields in IBS
      physiopathology and suggests that modification of BA profiles could have
      therapeutic potential.

TI  - Nutritional advice for community patients: insights from a panel discussion.
PG  - 130-7
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.3.130 [doi]
AB  - This article describes the conclusions of an expert panel that discussed four
      case studies; these were examples of patients typically encountered by nurses
      working in the community. The panel considered the nutritional and lifestyle
      advice that could be given by nurses relating to conditions such as irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, vulnerability to
      common infections, elderly care, recurrent urinary tract infection, antibiotic
      use, and risk of type 2 diabetes. A general conclusion was the importance of
      motivational interviewing techniques in achieving full understanding of patients'
      concerns and to determine the best health strategy. As well as specific guidance 
      appropriate for each disorder, a range of information sources for both health
      professionals and patients are listed in the paper. The panel noted that,
      although general nutritional advice can be given by nurses working at GP
      surgeries and in the community, patients should always be referred to registered 
      dietitians or nutritionists if significant dietary changes are considered.

TI  - The prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in children in Panama: a 
      school-based study.
PG  - e232-6
LID - 10.1111/apa.13379 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children, but
      the epidemiology of FGIDs is incompletely understood. Our aim was to perform a
      population-based study using Rome III criteria to describe the prevalence of
      FGIDs in children in Panama. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of
      children attending three schools in Panama City, Panama. Children with organic
      medical diseases were excluded. Subjects provided demographic information and
      completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms - Rome III
      Spanish version. RESULTS: A total of 321 subjects (61.1% female, median age 10
      years, range 8-14 years) completed our study. A total of 92 subjects (28.7%) met 
      criteria for an FGID. Gender, age and school type did not differ significantly
      between subjects with and without FGIDs. The most common FGIDs included
      functional constipation (15.9%), irritable bowel syndrome (5.6%), and functional 
      abdominal pain or functional abdominal pain syndrome (4.0%). Abdominal
      pain-related FGIDs were present in 12.1%. CONCLUSION: FGIDs are common in
      school-aged children in Panama. The prevalence of abdominal pain-related FGIDs in
      children in Panama is similar to that described in other parts of the world.
      Further population-based studies utilising Rome III criteria to measure FGID
      prevalence in children are needed to advance our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of FGIDs.

TI  - Fermentable Carbohydrate Restriction (Low FODMAP Diet) in Clinical Practice
      Improves Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.
PG  - 1129-36
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) experience functional-like gastrointestinal symptoms (FGS) even during
      remission. Research suggests that dietary restriction of fermentable
      carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, 
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet) can improve FGS, albeit in irritable bowel syndrome.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet
      delivered in routine clinical practice in patients with IBD and coexisting FGS.
      METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptom scores were compared in consecutive patients
      with IBD referred for low FODMAP dietary education for symptom management (n =
      88). Symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale, and
      stool output was assessed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale at both baseline and
      follow-up (minimum of 6 weeks). RESULTS: There was a significant and large
      increase in the numbers of patients reporting satisfactory relief of symptoms
      between baseline (14/88, 16%) and low FODMAP diet (69/88, 78%; P < 0.001).
      Following dietary intervention, there was also a significant decrease in severity
      for most symptoms and a reduction in composite symptom score (baseline mean: 1.2,
      SD: 0.5 versus low FODMAP diet mean: 0.7, SD: 0.5; P < 0.001). Improvements in
      stool consistency and frequency were observed, including an increase in "normal" 
      stool form (P = 0.002) and "normal" stool frequency (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      low FODMAP diet delivered in routine clinical practice seems effective in
      improving satisfaction with, and severity of, FGS in IBD. Randomized controlled
      trials are warranted to definitively establish effectiveness.

      the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and
      how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community.
      Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in
      IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which
      has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials 
      suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating 
      IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated
      effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel
      method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable
      carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical
      effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one
      unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the
      microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal
      Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction
      in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has
      clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration.
      Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the 
      complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both
      interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment
      has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for
      optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects
      on the GI microbiota.

AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

TI  - Lung-gut cross-talk: evidence, mechanisms and implications for the mucosal
      inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 519-28
LID - 10.1111/cea.12723 [doi]
AB  - The mucosal immune system (including airway, intestinal, oral and cervical
      epithelium) is an integrated network of tissues, cells and effector molecules
      that protect the host from environmental insults and infections at mucous
      membrane surfaces. Dysregulation of immunity at mucosal surfaces is thought to be
      responsible for the alarming global increase in mucosal inflammatory diseases
      such as those affecting the gastrointestinal (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      and irritable bowel syndrome) and respiratory (asthma, allergy and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disorder) system. Although immune regulation has been
      well-studied in isolated mucosal sites, the extent of the immune interaction
      between anatomically distant mucosal sites has been mostly circumstantial and the
      focus of much debate. With novel technology and more precise tools to examine
      histological and functional changes in tissues, today there is increased
      appreciation of the 'common mucosal immunological system' originally proposed by 
      Bienenstock nearly 40 years ago. Evidence is amounting which shows that
      stimulation of one mucosal compartment can directly and significantly impact
      distant mucosal site, however the mechanisms are unknown. Today, we are only
      beginning to understand the complexity of relationships and communications that
      exist between different mucosal compartments. A holistic approach to studying the
      mucosal immune system as an integrated global organ is imperative for future
      advances in understanding mucosal immunology and for future treatment of chronic 
      diseases. In this review, we particularly focus on the latest evidence and the
      mechanisms operational in driving the lung-gut cross-talk.

TI  - alpha-Conotoxin Vc1.1 inhibits human dorsal root ganglion neuroexcitability and
      mouse colonic nociception via GABAB receptors.
PG  - 1083-1094
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310971 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: alpha-Conotoxin Vc1.1 is a small disulfide-bonded peptide from the
      venom of the marine cone snail Conus victoriae. Vc1.1 has antinociceptive actions
      in animal models of neuropathic pain, but its applicability to inhibiting human
      dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuroexcitability and reducing chronic visceral pain
      (CVP) is unknown. DESIGN: We determined the inhibitory actions of Vc1.1 on human 
      DRG neurons and on mouse colonic sensory afferents in healthy and chronic
      visceral hypersensitivity (CVH) states. In mice, visceral nociception was
      assessed by neuronal activation within the spinal cord in response to noxious
      colorectal distension (CRD). Quantitative-reverse-transcription-PCR,
      single-cell-reverse-transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry determined
      gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor B (GABABR) and voltage-gated calcium channel
      (CaV2.2, CaV2.3) expression in human and mouse DRG neurons. RESULTS: Vc1.1
      reduced the excitability of human DRG neurons, whereas a synthetic Vc1.1 analogue
      that is inactive at GABABR did not. Human DRG neurons expressed GABABR and its
      downstream effector channels CaV2.2 and CaV2.3. Mouse colonic DRG neurons
      exhibited high GABABR, CaV2.2 and CaV2.3 expression, with upregulation of the
      CaV2.2 exon-37a variant during CVH. Vc1.1 inhibited mouse colonic afferents ex
      vivo and nociceptive signalling of noxious CRD into the spinal cord in vivo, with
      greatest efficacy observed during CVH. A selective GABABR antagonist prevented
      Vc1.1-induced inhibition, whereas blocking both CaV2.2 and CaV2.3 caused
      inhibition comparable with Vc1.1 alone. CONCLUSIONS: Vc1.1-mediated activation of
      GABABR is a novel mechanism for reducing the excitability of human DRG neurons.
      Vc1.1-induced activation of GABABR on the peripheral endings of colonic afferents
      reduces nociceptive signalling. The enhanced antinociceptive actions of Vc1.1
      during CVH suggest it is a novel candidate for the treatment for CVP.

      development and psychometric evaluation.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s12955-016-0423-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important outcome
      indicator for chronic disease, and particularly in the absence of biological
      markers for illness, such as with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aims of
      this study were to develop and evaluate a new IBS-specific HRQOL instrument
      (IBS-HR-QOL). METHODS: This methodological study comprised three steps:
      conceptualization of the IBS-HR-QOL, item extraction and establishment of content
      validity, and psychometric evaluation of the instrument with 267 IBS patients
      recruited from four university hospitals. RESULTS: The content validity of the
      developed IBS-HR-QOL was assessed by 11 experts. Exploratory and confirmatory
      factor analyses yielded four factors. The criterion and convergent validities of 
      the IBS-HR-QOL were demonstrated using the Short Form-36 and the Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale, respectively. Known-groups validity was demonstrated using 
      a symptom-severity scale. The internal consistency reliability and test-retest
      reliability were satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation
      coefficient of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS-HR-QOL comprises
      a total of 16 items. The IBS-HR-QOL demonstrated good psychometric properties.
      This instrument is easily comprehensible and short, rendering it feasible for use
      in clinical practice and research.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and
      function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent
      studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and
      to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut
      microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies
      underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and
      metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests 
      that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, 
      drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an
      adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early
      gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies
      using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have 
      yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use 
      is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric 
      disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in
      most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are
      anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut 
      microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for
      improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.

AB  - Food is essential for life. Yet, poor food choices may cause poor health. Dietary
      manipulation is frequently integrated into the management of common chronic
      pediatric conditions. Parents seek dietary information to have more control over 
      child's condition and to avoid side effects of medicine. This article reviews
      selected diets for a few common pediatric disorders including eczema, attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, headache and migraine, non-celiac gluten
      sensitivity, and irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Low Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels Are Associated with Dry Eye Syndrome.
PG  - e0147847
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0147847 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common tear film and ocular surface
      disease that results in discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability
      with potential damage to the ocular surface. Systemic diseases associated with
      DES include diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, anxiety, thyroid
      disease, allergic diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, and 
      hyperlipidemia. Interestingly, it has been found that most of these are
      associated with low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) or inadequate
      sunlight exposure. METHODS: In this cross-sectional data analysis,
      noninstitutionalized adults aged >/=19 years (N = 17,542) who participated in
      Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012 were included. 
      Information regarding duration of sunlight exposure was collected from the survey
      participants. Serum 25(OH)D and zinc levels were measured. The confounding
      variables were age, gender, sunlight exposure time, region of residence, obesity,
      serum 25(OH)D level, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, thyroid
      disorder, atopic dermatitis, history of ocular surgery, regular exercise, and
      walking exercise. RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D levels of subjects with and without
      DES were 16.90 +/- 6.0 and 17.52 +/- 6.07 (p<0.001). Inadequate sunlight exposure
      time (odds ratio [OR], 1.554; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.307-1.848), urban
      residence (OR, 1.669; 95% CI, 1.456-1.913), indoor occupation (OR, 1.578; 95% CI,
      1.389-1.814), and low serum 25(OH)D level (OR, 1.158; 95% CI, 1.026-1.308) were
      the risk factors for DES. After adjusting for age, sex, obesity, diabetes
      mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, thyroid disorder, atopic dermatitis, 
      history of ocular surgery, regular exercise, and occupation, low serum 25(OH)D
      level (OR, 1.178; 95% CI, 1.010-1.372) and deficient sunlight exposure time (OR, 
      1.383; 95% CI, 1.094-1.749) were the risk factors for diagnosed DES. CONCLUSION: 
      Low serum 25(OH)D levels and inadequate sunlight exposure are associated with DES
      in Korean adults. These results suggest that sufficient sunlight exposure or
      vitamin D supplementation may be useful in DES treatment.

AB  - Blastocystis species has been extensively studied in recent few years to
      establish its pathogenecity. Present study was designed to identify and examine
      the association of Blastocystis sp. and its subtypes with Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome (IBS).Blastocystis sp. detected using wet-mount microscopy, trichrome
      staining, in-vitro culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay in a cohort 
      of IBS patients (n = 150) and healthy controls (n = 100). Isolates of
      Blastocystis sp.were subtyped using Sequence Tagged Site and representative
      samples were sequenced at SSUrRNA locus.A total of sixty five isolates of
      Blastocystis sp. were identified [IBS (n = 50); Controls (n = 15)] of which 91%
      belonged to ST3 and 9% belonged to ST1. No other subtypes could be identified.
      Statistically significant association was observed between Blastocystis sp. and
      IBS patients; however no particular subtype could be ascertained to any
      particular clinical type of IBS.The frequency of occurrence of Blastocystis sp.
      was more in IBS patients as compared to the controls and ST3 being the most
      prevalent subtype. The genetic polymorphism of SSU-rRNA gene amongst the
      different Blastocystis sp.isolates found in this study reinforces the fact that
      these organisms are genetically highly divergent.

      of probiotics.
PG  - 467-75
LID - 10.2217/fmb.15.150 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are living micro-organisms that do not naturally have shelf life, and 
      normally are weakly protected against the digestive action of the GI tract. A new
      dual coating technology has been developed in an effort to maximize survival,
      that is, to be able to reach the intestine alive and in sufficient numbers to
      confer the beneficial health effects on the host. Dual-coating of lactic acid
      bacteria (LAB) is the result of fourth-generation coating technology for the
      protection of these bacteria at least 100-fold or greater than the uncoated LAB. 
      This innovative technique involves a first pH-dependent protein layer that
      protects bacteria from gastric acid and bile salt, and a second polysaccharide
      matrix that protects bacteria from external factors, such as humidity,
      temperature and pressure, as well as the digestive action during the passage
      through the GI tract. Dual-coated probiotic formulation is applicable to
      different therapeutic areas, including irritable bowel syndrome, atopic
      dermatitis, acute diarrhea, chronic constipation, Helicobacter pylori
      eradication, and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. An updated review 
      of the efficacy of doubly coated probiotic strains for improving bacterial
      survival in the intestinal tract and its consequent clinical benefits in humans
      is here presented.

AB  - AIM: Because of increasing awareness of variations in the use of pancreatic
      exocrine replacement therapy, the Australasian Pancreatic Club decided it was
      timely to re-review the literature and create new Australasian guidelines for the
      management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). METHODS: A working party
      of expert clinicians was convened and initially determined that by dividing the
      types of presentation into three categories for the likelihood of PEI (definite, 
      possible and unlikely) they were able to consider the difficulties of diagnosing 
      PEI and relate these to the value of treatment for each diagnostic category.
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies confirm that patients with chronic
      pancreatitis receive similar benefit from pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy
      (PERT) to that established in children with cystic fibrosis. Severe acute
      pancreatitis is frequently followed by PEI and PERT should be considered for
      these patients because of their nutritional requirements. Evidence is also
      becoming stronger for the benefits of PERT in patients with unresectable
      pancreatic cancer. However there is as yet no clear guide to help identify those 
      patients in the 'unlikely' PEI group who would benefit from PERT. For example,
      patients with coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus, irritable bowel syndrome and
      weight loss in the elderly may occasionally be given a trial of PERT, but
      determining its effectiveness will be difficult. The starting dose of PERT should
      be from 25,000-40,000 IU lipase taken with food. This may need to be titrated up 
      and there may be a need for proton pump inhibitors in some patients to improve
      efficacy.

TI  - Prevalence of Lactose Malabsorption and Lactose Intolerance in Pediatric Patients
      with Selected Gastrointestinal Diseases.
PG  - 863-71
LID - 10.17219/acem/26337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactase is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of lactose.
      Deficiency of the enzyme (hypolactasia) may be determined genetically or arise
      secondarily to disease of small intestine. Under this condition, lactose enters
      the colon where it is fermented by intestinal microflora and turns to gases and
      short-chain fatty acids, causing gastrointestinal symptoms known as lactose
      intolerance (LI). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of lactose
      malabsorption (LM), LI and the coexistence of these two conditions in children
      with upper gastrointestinal tract diseases (UGTD), malabsorption syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (FGID). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hydrogen breath test (HBT) was conducted in 387
      pediatric patients in years 2010-2013. Two hundred thirty two children with
      gastrointestinal tract diseases were selected and assigned to groups - UGTD,
      malabsorption syndrome, IBD or FGID. For each group the frequency of LM,
      frequency and severity of LI and the frequency of their co-occurrence were
      calculated. RESULTS: Lactose malabsorption was observed in 37.08% of patients
      with gastrointestinal diseases. Positive HBT result was the most common in
      children with malabsorption syndrome (52.50%) and less common in UGTD (30.85%),
      especially in ulcer disease (23.53%). Symptoms after lactose ingestion affected
      36.64% of the subjects, and were more specific to lactose malabsorbers than to
      lactose absorbers (72.10% vs. 15.75%). The higher frequency of LI was noted in
      children with FGID, especially in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (65.22%). The
      lowest incidence of symptoms was obtained in children with UGTD, especially in
      those with ulcer disease (27.44%). The incidence of LM with LI was noted in
      27.16% of all patients and was the highest in IBS (47.83%) and the lowest in
      ulcer disease (15.78%). CONCLUSIONS: Lactose malabsorption is a common problem in
      children with gastrointestinal diseases, especially in children with bowel
      diseases. Lactose intolerance is related to LM, but does not affect all
      malabsorbers.

AB  - Food intake is expected to cover our basal requirements in energy, proteins,
      minerals, vitamins, trace elements and water. As it has been already suggested by
      Hippocrates, food can play a role in preventing but also in caring some diseases.
      The type of diet has medical, mediatic, economic and cultural implications. Many 
      diets are recommended but only a few of them have been validated. The fight
      against obesity has also created a lot of diet for losing weight. This article is
      a critical review of some diet in the domain of cancer, gluten sensitivity,
      irritable bowel syndrome and therapeutic fasting.

TI  - Bristol Stool Form Scale reliability and agreement decreases when determining
      Rome III stool form designations.
PG  - 443-8
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rater reproducibility of the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), which
      categorizes stools into one of seven types, is unknown. We sought to determine
      reliability and agreement by individual stool type and when responses are
      categorized by Rome III clinical designation as normal or abnormal (constipation 
      or diarrhea). METHODS: Thirty-four gastroenterology providers from three
      institutions rated 35 stool photographs using the BSFS. Twenty rerated the
      photographs. KEY RESULTS: 1190 individual stool type ratings were completed.
      Though only four photographs had absolute agreement (all Type 1 or Type 7),
      general agreement was high with 1132 (95.1%) of ratings being within one category
      type of the modal rating. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the BSFS by 
      individual stool type was excellent with intraclass correlations of 0.88 (95% CI:
      0.86-0.90, p < 0.001) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91, p < 0.001), respectively.
      However, agreement decreased when using Rome III designations with 13 (37%)
      photographs having significantly diverging classifications (semi-interquartile
      range = 0.5). These 13 photographs were rated by the majority of raters as either
      type 2 vs type 3 or type 5 vs type 6 stools, representing the boundaries of
      normal vs abnormal stools. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the BSFS by
      Rome III clinical categorization decreased with intraclass correlations of 0.75
      (95% CI: 0.69-0.81, p < 0.001) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.49-0.81, p < 0.001),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The Bristol Stool Form Scale has
      excellent reliability and agreement when used to rate individual stool type by
      raters. However, BSFS reliability and agreement decreases when determining Rome
      III stool form categories.

TI  - The Overlap between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A
      Clinical Dilemma.
PG  - 10417-26
LID - 10.3390/nu7125541 [doi]
AB  - The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes
      celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of 
      symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or
      abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they 
      can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are 
      diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain
      asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for
      the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of 
      symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a
      dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from
      the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a
      gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both
      can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common
      pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well
      understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors
      such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function 
      and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal
      role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported
      to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the
      source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.

TI  - Management of bile acid malabsorption using low-fat dietary interventions: a
      useful strategy applicable to some patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable 
      bowel syndrome?
PG  - 536-40
LID - 10.7861/clinmedicine.15-6-536 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluates the efficacy of low-fat dietary interventions in the
      management of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms due to bile acid malabsorption. In
      total, 40 patients with GI symptoms and a 7-day (75)selenium homocholic acid
      taurine (SeHCAT) scan result of <20%, were prospectively recruited and then
      advised regarding a low-fat dietary intervention. Before and after dietary
      intervention, patients rated their GI symptoms using a 10-point numerical scale, 
      and recorded their intake in 7-day dietary diaries. After dietary intervention,
      the median scores for all GI symptoms decreased, with a significant reduction for
      urgency, bloating, lack of control, bowel frequency (p >/=: 0.01). Mean dietary
      fat intake reduced to 42 g fat after intervention (p >/=: 0.01). Low-fat dietary 
      interventions in patients with a SeHCAT scan result of <20% leads to clinically
      important improvement in GI symptoms and should be widely used.

TI  - Depression and Somatization Are Associated With Increased Postprandial Symptoms
      in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 866-74
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.11.010 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(15)01627-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have increased
      postprandial symptom responses and more psychosocial morbidities than healthy
      individuals. However, the relationship between psychosocial status and
      postprandial symptom responses in patients with IBS is unclear. We investigated
      this relationship in a prospective study of patients with IBS. METHODS: A total
      of 193 IBS patients, diagnosed according to Rome II (n = 126) or Rome III (n =
      67) criteria, consumed a standard breakfast (540 kcal: 36% fat, 15% proteins, 49%
      carbohydrates, and 8.9 g fiber). They completed visual analogue scales assessing 
      the severity of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, nausea,
      gas, and fullness) before breakfast and every 30 minutes, up to 240 minutes after
      eating. All patients completed validated self-report questionnaires for their
      current levels of anxiety and depression; patients diagnosed based on Rome II
      criteria also completed a somatization questionnaire. The relationship between
      these variables and the course of gastrointestinal symptom scores over time was
      analyzed using linear mixed models, controlling for comorbid functional
      dyspepsia. RESULTS: We observed a main effect of anxiety levels on fullness and
      bloating (P < .04), and of depression levels on abdominal pain (P = .007),
      reflecting a general upward shift of the entire symptom curve. Depression-by-time
      interactions were seen for nausea and gas (P < .03). Somatization levels had a
      main effect on all 5 symptoms (P < .0001), independent of anxiety and depression.
      We observed somatization-by-time interaction effects for bloating (P = .005), and
      nausea (P = .02), and a nonsignificant trend was found for pain (P = .054),
      reflecting a steeper early postprandial increase in symptoms among subjects with 
      higher levels of somatization. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a prospective study of
      patients with IBS, psychosocial morbidities are associated with increased levels 
      of gastrointestinal symptoms in general. Depression and somatization levels are
      associated specifically with increased postprandial symptoms.

TI  - Changes in the Abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Phylogroups I and II in 
      the Intestinal Mucosa of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Patients with Colorectal 
      Cancer.
PG  - 28-41
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000590 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii comprises 2 phylogroups, whose abundance
      in healthy and diseased gut and in conjunction with Escherichia coli has not yet 
      been studied. This work aims to determine the contribution of F. prausnitzii
      phylogroups I and II in intestinal disease and to assess their potential
      diagnostic usefulness as biomarkers for gut diseases. METHODS: Total F.
      prausnitzii, its phylogroups, and E. coli loads were determined by quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene on biopsies from 31 healthy
      controls (H), 45 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 25 patients with ulcerative 
      colitis, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 20 patients with
      colorectal cancer. Data were normalized to total bacterial counts and analyzed
      according to patients' disease location and clinical characteristics. RESULTS:
      Lower levels of both total F. prausnitzii and phylogroup I were found in subjects
      with CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) compared with H
      subjects. Phylogroup I load was a better biomarker than total F. prausnitzii to
      discriminate subjects with gut disorders from H. Phylogroup II depletion was
      observed only in patients with CD (P < 0.001) and can be potentially applied to
      differentiate ulcerative pancolitis from colonic CD. No statistically significant
      correlation between E. coli and any of the 2 F. prausnitzii phylogroups was found
      in any group of patients or by inflammatory bowel disease location. Phylogroup I 
      was lower in active patients with CD, whereas those CD with intestinal resection 
      showed a reduction in phylogroup II. Treatments with mesalazine and
      immunosuppressants did not result in the recovery of F. prausnitzii phylogroups
      abundance. CONCLUSIONS: F. prausnitzii phylogroup I was depleted in CD,
      ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer, whereas phylogroup II was specifically
      reduced in CD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii phylogroups and E. coli may help 
      to identify gut disorders and to classify inflammatory bowel disease location.

TI  - Perceived food intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome in a population 3 years
      after a giardiasis-outbreak: a historical cohort study.
PG  - 164
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0393-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an increased prevalence of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) after acute gastroenteritis. Food as a precipitating and
      perpetuating factor in IBS has gained recent interest, but food intolerance
      following gastroenteritis is less investigated. The aims of this study were
      firstly, to compare perceived food intolerance in a group previously exposed to
      Giardia lamblia with a control group; secondly, to explore the relation with IBS 
      status; and thirdly, to investigate associations with content of fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) in foods
      reported. METHODS: This is a historical cohort study with mailed questionnaire to
      1252 Giardia exposed and a control cohort matched by gender and age. Differences 
      between groups were investigated using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
      RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate in the exposed group was 65.3 %
      (817/1252) and in the control group 31.4 % (1128/3598). The adjusted odds ratio
      (OR) for perceived food intolerance for the exposed group was 2.00 with 95 %
      confidence interval (CI): 1.65 to 2.42, as compared with the control group.
      Perceived intolerance for dairy products was the most frequently reported
      intolerance, with an adjusted OR for the exposed of 1.95 (95 % CI: 1.51 to 2.51).
      Perceived intolerance for fatty foods, vegetables, fruit, cereals and alcohol was
      also significantly higher in the exposed group. The groups did not differ in
      perceived intolerance to spicy foods, coffee or soda. The association between
      exposure to Giardia infection and perceived food intolerance differed between the
      IBS group and the no-IBS group, but IBS was not a significant effect modifier for
      the association. Perceived intolerance for high FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.91)
      and low FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.55) was significantly associated with
      exposure status. CONCLUSION: Exposure to Giardia infection was associated with
      perceived food intolerance 3 years after giardiasis. IBS status did not alter the
      association between exposure status and perceived food intolerance. Perceived
      intolerance to high FODMAP foods and low FODMAP foods were both statistically
      significantly associated with exposure to Giardia infection.

LID - 10.1517/14728214.2015.1105215 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is a
      common disorder and accounts for a large number of ambulatory visits. Sensory
      abnormalities, that is, presence of abdominal pain and discomfort, distinguish
      IBS-C from chronic idiopathic constipation. AREA COVERED: This review focuses on 
      the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and future of prucalopride, YKP-10811,
      DSP-6952, dexloxiglumide, linaclotide, plecanatide, tenapanor, and elobixibat.
      EXPERT OPINION: It is now well established that treatment focusing only on bowel 
      transit provides incomplete relief to patients with IBS-C. Improved understanding
      of pathophysiology of IBS-C has led to use of sensory end points like complete
      spontaneous bowel movements and the FDA combined end point (abdominal pain and
      complete spontaneous bowel movements) in clinical trials. A number of drugs are
      in development and provide hope for this challenging group of patients. However, 
      because of recent failures secondary to ineffectiveness and/or adverse events, we
      cautiously await how clinical data play out in larger studies and in clinical
      practice.

TI  - Alterations in serotonin metabolism in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 272-82
LID - 10.1111/apt.13459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonin (5-HT) metabolism have been postulated to
      play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However,
      previous reports regarding 5-HT metabolism in IBS are contradicting. AIM: To
      compare platelet poor plasma (PPP) 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) 
      levels and their ratio in a large cohort of IBS patients and healthy controls
      (HC), including IBS-subgroup analysis. METHODS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients
      and HC were evaluated for fasting PPP 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. Furthermore,
      GI-symptom diary, GSRS, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores were
      assessed in the 2 weeks before blood sampling. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty
      four IBS patients and 137 HC were included. No differences were detected in
      plasma 5-HT between groups. The 5-HIAA concentrations and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were 
      significantly lower in IBS compared to HC: 24.6 +/- 21.9 vs. 39.0 +/- 29.5 mug/L 
      (P < 0.001) and 8.4 +/- 12.2 vs. 13.5 +/- 16.6 (P < 0.01), respectively. Subtype 
      analysis for 5-HIAA showed all IBS subtypes to be significantly different from
      HC. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was significantly lower in the IBS-M subtype vs. HC.
      Linear regression analysis points to an influence of gender but not of
      GI-symptoms, psychological scores or medication use. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated
      that fasting 5-HT plasma levels are not significantly different in IBS patients
      compared to controls. However, decreased 5-HIAA levels and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in
      IBS patients may reflect altered serotonin metabolism in IBS. Gender affects
      5-HIAA levels in IBS patients, but no effects of drugs, such as SSRIs, or higher 
      GI-symptom or psychological scores were found.

PG  - 747-59
LID - 10.1177/0884533615610081 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are foods or products that contain live microorganisms that benefit
      the host when administered. In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature
      associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, 
      focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis,
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized
      controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also
      suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an 
      adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed
      babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these
      findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for
      the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Low-FODMAP formula improves diarrhea and nutritional status in hospitalized
      patients receiving enteral nutrition: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind
      clinical trial.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0106-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) are poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates that play an
      important role in inducing functional gut symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet improves
      abdominal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable
      bowel syndrome. However, there were no study for the effect of FODMAP content on 
      gastrointestinal intolerance and nutritional status in patients receiving enteral
      nutrition (EN). METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 14-day
      clinical trial, eligible hospitalized patients receiving EN (n = 100) were
      randomly assigned to three groups; 84 patients completed the trial (low-FODMAP
      EN, n = 30; moderate-FODMAP EN, n = 28; high-FODMAP EN, n = 26). Anthropometric
      and biochemical parameters were measured; stool assessment was performed using
      the King's Stool Chart and clinical definition. RESULTS: Baseline values were not
      significantly different among the three groups. After the 14-day intervention,
      diarrhea significantly improved in the low-FODMAP group than in the moderate- and
      high-FODMAP groups (P < 0.05). King's Stool scores in diarrhea subjects were
      significantly and steadily reduced in the low-FODMAP group compared with the
      other two groups (P for time and EN type interaction <0.05). BMI increased
      significantly in the low- and high-FODMAP groups during the intervention (P <
      0.05 for both), and showed a trend toward increasing in the moderate-FODMAP group
      (P < 0.10). Serum prealbumin increased significantly in all groups by 14-day; by 
      3-day, it had increased to the levels at 14-day in the low-FODMAP group. At
      14-day, serum transferrin had increased significantly in the moderate-FODMAP
      group. In addition, subjects were classified by final condition (unimproved,
      normal maintenance, diarrhea only improved, constipation only improved, and
      recurrent diarrhea/constipation improved). Seventy-five percent of the diarrhea
      improved group consumed the low-FODMAP EN formula. 38.5 and 46.2% of recurrent
      diarrhea/constipation improved group consumed the low- and moderate-FODMAP EN
      respectively. BMI significantly increased in all groups except the unimproved.
      Prealbumin levels significantly increased in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent 
      diarrhea/constipation groups at 3-day and continued by 14-day, and in the
      constipation-improved group at 14-day. Transferrin levels significantly increased
      in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent diarrhea/constipation groups at 14-day.
      CONCLUSION: Low-FODMAP EN may improve diarrhea, leading to improved nutritional
      status and facilitating prompt recovery from illness.

AB  - Functional disorders and diseases are usually diagnosed by exclusion when there
      is no clear presence of inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic
      processes which would explain the symptoms and difficulties of the patient. The
      Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGID) are
      used in clinical and scientific medicine. Functional disorders of the upper
      gastrointestinal system in adults are classified into six groups. Group C are
      functional bowel disorders which include irritable bowel syndrome (C1),
      functional bloating (C2), functional constipation (C3) and functional diarrhea
      (4). The symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders are often a
      combination of disrupted physiological functions, such as an increase in motor
      reactivity of the intestine, visceral hypersensitivity, impaired immune functions
      and inflammatory intestinal mucosa followed by change in the intestinal bacterial
      flora and disrupted central nervous system-enteric nervous system regulation
      because of exposure to different psychosocial and sociocultural factors. The
      symptoms must be present for at least six months before clinical manifestation of
      the disease and also must be currently present and diagnostically confirmed in
      the last three months. Diagnostic procedures are targeted individually, depending
      on the patient age, nature of symptoms, and other clinical and laboratory
      characteristics. Treatment is based on health education, nutrition counseling,
      medication and psychological support.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Altered Intestinal Permeability Induced by Combat
      Training Are Associated with Distinct Metabotypic Changes.
PG  - 4734-42

AB  - Physical and psychological stress have been shown to modulate multiple aspects of
      gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, but its molecular basis remains elusive. We
      therefore characterized the stress-induced metabolic phenotype (metabotype) in
      soldiers during high-intensity combat training and correlated the metabotype with
      changes in GI symptoms and permeability. In a prospective, longitudinal study,
      urinary metabotyping was conducted on 38 male healthy soldiers during combat
      training and a rest period using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The
      urinary metabotype during combat training was clearly distinct from the rest
      period (partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) Q(2) = 0.581),
      confirming the presence of a unique stress-induced metabotype. Differential
      metabolites related to combat stress were further uncovered, including elevated
      pyroglutamate and fructose, and reduced gut microbial metabolites, namely,
      hippurate and m-hydroxyphenylacetate (p < 0.05). The extent of pyroglutamate
      upregulation exhibited a positive correlation with an increase in IBS-SSS in
      soldiers during combat training (r = 0.5, p < 0.05). Additionally, the rise in
      fructose levels was positively correlated with an increase in intestinal
      permeability (r = 0.6, p < 0.005). In summary, protracted and mixed psychological
      and physical combat-training stress yielded unique metabolic changes that
      corresponded with the incidence and severity of GI symptoms and alteration in
      intestinal permeability. Our study provided novel molecular insights into
      stress-induced GI perturbations, which could be exploited for future biomarker
      research or development of therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be assigned
      to groups with different gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms based on results from a
      combined nutrient and lactulose challenge. We aimed to identify factors that
      predict outcomes to this challenge and to determine whether this can be used in
      noninvasive assessment of visceral sensitivity in patients with IBS. METHODS: We 
      performed a prospective study of 100 patients with IBS diagnosed according to
      Rome III criteria (all subtypes) and seen at a secondary or tertiary care center.
      After an overnight fast, subjects were given a liquid breakfast (400 mL;
      Nutridrink) that contained 25 g lactulose. Before the challenge, we assessed
      visceral sensitivity (via rectal barostat), oro-anal transit time, and fecal
      microbiota composition (via 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing); we determined IBS 
      severity using questionnaires. The intensity of 8 GI symptoms, the level of
      digestive comfort, and the amount of exhaled H2 and CH4 in breath were measured
      before and during a 4-hour period after the liquid breakfast. RESULTS: Based on
      the intensity of 8 GI symptoms and level of digestive comfort during the
      challenge, patients were assigned to groups with high-intensity GI symptoms (HGS;
      n = 39) or low-intensity GI symptoms (LGS; n = 61); patients with HGS had more
      severe IBS (P < .0001), higher somatization (P < .01), and lower quality of life 
      (P < .05-.01) than patients with LGS. Patients with HGS also had significantly
      higher rectal sensitivity to random phasic distensions (P < .05-.001, compared
      with patients with LGS). There were no significant differences between groups in 
      fecal microbiota composition, exhaled gas in breath, or oro-anal transit time.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found, in a prospective study, that results from a lactulose
      challenge test could be used to determine visceral sensitivity and severity of
      IBS. The intensity of patient symptoms did not correlate with the composition of 
      the fecal microbiota. The lactulose challenge test may help better characterize
      patients with IBS and evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. ClinicalTrial.gov

TI  - Psychological factors selectively upregulate rectal pain perception in
      hypersensitive patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1772-82
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visceral hypersensitivity and psychological symptoms are frequent
      features in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Exploring mechanistic pathways
      leading to visceral hypersensitivity is of importance to direct future studies
      and treatment options. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of
      psychological factors to the perception of painful and non-painful rectal
      sensations in hyper- vs normosensitive IBS patients. METHODS: We included 138 IBS
      patients (Rome II criteria) who underwent an ascending method of limited rectal
      balloon distension paradigm. At the end of each distension step, subjects rated
      the perceived intensity of non-painful ('unpleasantness') and painful rectal
      sensations on visual analog scales. Sensitivity status was determined based on
      pain thresholds. Anxiety, depression and somatization were assessed by
      questionnaires. Mixed models were used to test the relationship between
      sensitivity status, psychological variables, and pain & unpleasantness ratings
      upon increasing distension. KEY RESULTS: Hypersensitive IBS patients had lower
      sensory thresholds for pain, first perception, urge to defecate, and discomfort
      (p < 0.0001). Upon increasing distension, they rated both painful and non-painful
      sensations as more intense than normosensitive patients (p < 0.0001).
      Psychological factors were associated with higher pain ratings during distension 
      in hypersensitive (p < 0.006-0.0001), but not in normosensitive patients.
      Anxiety, but not depression or somatization, was associated with increased
      intensity ratings of non-painful sensations (p < 0.001), independent of
      sensitivity status. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Hypersensitive IBS patients are
      characterized by increased perception of pain, but also of non-painful
      sensations. Psychological factors increase the perception of painful sensations
      in hypersensitive patients only, whereas non-painful visceral sensations were
      exaggerated in anxious patients regardless of the sensitivity status.

TI  - Quantitative Risk-Benefit Analysis of Probiotic Use for Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1007/s40264-015-0349-x [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have seen widespread use for a variety of gastrointestinal problems,
      especially in two common disorders: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory
      bowel disease. Since a wide variety of probiotic preparations has been used, and 
      despite a large number of studies performed, a great deal of heterogeneity exists
      among them. Straightforward evidence-based recommendations for the use of
      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease have thus
      been difficult to formulate. In an effort to improve understanding of the
      risk-benefit balance of probiotics in these conditions, this study (1) queried
      the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for all reported
      adverse drug events related to probiotics in 2013, and (2) constructed
      risk-benefit planes for both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease using a geometric approximation of the confidence region between risk and
      benefit. The results show that adverse events from probiotics vary widely by
      disease, and when they occur, they are mild and may be difficult to distinguish
      from the natural history of the underlying disorders they are used to treat. The 
      risk-benefit plane for irritable bowel syndrome straddles the risk-benefit
      threshold, so patients can expect a balance between a low chance of risk and also
      a low chance of benefit. The risk-benefit plane for inflammatory bowel disease
      largely lies above the risk-benefit threshold, so patients may expect more
      benefit than risk in most cases. More standardized and high-quality research is
      needed to improve our understanding of risk and benefit for these complex
      biopharmaceuticals.

      Nigerians.
PG  - 588-93
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000994 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, pattern, and predisposing factors of
      abdominal pain-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGIDs) in
      adolescent Nigerians. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 states 
      in the southern part of Nigeria in June 2014. Adolescents of age 10 to 18 years
      were recruited from 11 secondary schools using a stratified random sampling
      technique. A validated self-administered questionnaire on Rome III criteria for
      diagnosing AP-FGIDs and its determinants were filled by the participants in a
      classroom setting. RESULTS: A total of 874 participants filled the questionnaire.
      Of this, 818 (93.4%) filled it properly and were included in the final analysis. 
      The mean age of the participants was 14.6 +/- 2.0 years with 409 (50.0%) being
      boys. AP-FGIDs were present in 81 (9.9%) participants. Forty six (5.6%) of the
      study participants had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 21 (2.6%) functional
      abdominal pain, 15 (1.8%) abdominal migraine while 3 (0.4%) had functional
      dyspepsia. The difference in AP-FGIDs between adolescents residing in rural and
      urban areas was not statistically significant (P = 0.22). Intestinal and
      extra-intestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in those with AP-FGIDs. Nausea
      was the only symptom independently associated with AP-FGIDs (p = 0.015). Multiple
      regression analysis showed no significant association between stressful life
      events and AP-FGIDs. CONCLUSIONS: AP-FGIDs are a significant health problem in
      Nigerian adolescents. In addition to the intestinal symptoms, most of the
      affected children and others also had extraintestinal symptoms. None of the
      stressful life events evaluated was significantly associated with FGIDs.

TI  - Relationship Between Microbiota of the Colonic Mucosa vs Feces and Symptoms,
      Colonic Transit, and Methane Production in Female Patients With Chronic
      Constipation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In fecal samples from patients with chronic constipation, the 
      microbiota differs from that of healthy subjects. However, the profiles of fecal 
      microbiota only partially replicate those of the mucosal microbiota. It is not
      clear whether these differences are caused by variations in diet or colonic
      transit, or are associated with methane production (measured by breath tests). We
      compared the colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota in patients with chronic
      constipation and in healthy subjects to investigate the relationships between
      microbiota and other parameters. METHODS: Sigmoid colonic mucosal and fecal
      microbiota samples were collected from 25 healthy women (controls) and 25 women
      with chronic constipation and evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing
      (average, 49,186 reads/sample). We assessed associations between microbiota
      (overall composition and operational taxonomic units) and demographic variables, 
      diet, constipation status, colonic transit, and methane production (measured in
      breath samples after oral lactulose intake). RESULTS: Fourteen patients with
      chronic constipation had slow colonic transit. The profile of the colonic mucosal
      microbiota differed between constipated patients and controls (P < .05). The
      overall composition of the colonic mucosal microbiota was associated with
      constipation, independent of colonic transit (P < .05), and discriminated between
      patients with constipation and controls with 94% accuracy. Genera from
      Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the colonic mucosal microbiota of patients
      with constipation. The profile of the fecal microbiota was associated with
      colonic transit before adjusting for constipation, age, body mass index, and
      diet; genera from Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Lactococcus, and Roseburia)
      correlated with faster colonic transit. Methane production was associated with
      the composition of the fecal microbiota, but not with constipation or colonic
      transit. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for diet and colonic transit, the profile
      of the microbiota in the colonic mucosa could discriminate patients with
      constipation from healthy individuals. The profile of the fecal microbiota was
      associated with colonic transit and methane production (measured in breath), but 
      not constipation.

TI  - Practical management of irritable bowel syndrome: a clinical review.
PG  - 30-48
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder,
      frequently managed by general practitioners and gastroenterologists. It is a
      complex condition, characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with 
      altered bowel habits, and it affects 11% of the population worldwide. It has a
      profound effect on quality of life for many patients and poses a substantial cost
      to society. Due to the complexity and diversity of IBS, diagnosis and treatment
      can be challenging. Common drawbacks in diagnosing and treating this disorder
      include unnecessary tests, failure to establish trust in the physician-patient
      relationship and difficulties in explaining the diagnosis. Research in recent
      years has however refined the diagnostic criteria and improved our ability to
      safely identify IBS with a limited number of investigations. A concise diagnostic
      evaluation, guided adequate information, prompt initiation of symptom-guided
      treatment and consistency in the patient-doctor relationship can help relieve the
      suffering experienced by patients with IBS. For patients with mild symptoms,
      reassurance, education, lifestyle changes and dietary advice are often
      sufficient. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms might need symptom
      modifying drugs, and psychological treatments such as CBT or hypnotherapy may be 
      offered at this stage. For patients with severe and incapacitating symptoms, a
      multidisciplinary approach is recommended and psychotropic drugs are often used. 
      This clinical review offers suggestions for a diagnostic approach as well as a
      treatment strategy, based on the current evidence on pathophysiology, diagnosis
      and treatment in IBS.

TI  - Scientific evidence for health effects attributed to the consumption of
      probiotics and prebiotics: an update for current perspectives and future
      challenges.
PG  - 1993-2015
LID - 10.1017/S0007114515003864 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as 
      supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent
      years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions 
      on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by 
      the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of
      probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined 
      the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract
      infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal
      disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a
      deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune
      system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to
      establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design 
      of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising 
      results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical
      studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the
      outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics
      in clinical practice.

TI  - Increased serum levels of lipopolysaccharide and antiflagellin antibodies in
      patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1747-54
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Innate immune responses to conserved microbial products such as
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin are likely important in microbial-host
      interactions and intestinal homeostasis. We hypothesized that bacterial
      translocation and activation of mucosal immunity against common microbial
      antigens might be involved in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 
      We therefore compared serum levels of LPS, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and flagellin
      antibodies between patients with different subtypes of IBS and healthy controls. 
      METHODS: We analyzed serum obtained from 88 patients (74 females) aged 19(43)-73 
      years and 106 healthy volunteers (77 females) aged 19(38)-62 years.
      Diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) was present in 32 patients (36%), 23 patients
      (26%) had constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), and 33 patients (38%) had A-IBS. 
      We used ELISA for sCD14 and antiflagellin immunoglobulin G and limulus amebocyte 
      assay for LPS. Abdominal symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities were assessed
      using validated questionnaires. KEY RESULTS: We found a significantly higher
      serum level of LPS in patients with D-IBS compared to controls (p = 0.0155). The 
      level of antibodies to flagellin was higher in patients with IBS than in controls
      (mainly driven by higher levels in D-IBS, p = 0.0018). The levels of sCD14 were
      lower in D-IBS patients compared to controls (p = 0.0498). We found a weak, but
      significant correlation between the levels of antiflagellin antibodies and
      anxiety among IBS patients (rho = 0.38; p = 0.0045). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES:
      Our results support the concept that immune reactivity to luminal antigens may
      have a role in the development of D-IBS. The serum level of antiflagellin
      antibodies was found to correlate with patients' self-reported anxiety score.

LID - S0022-3476(15)00836-7 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate annual medical and nonmedical costs of care for children 
      diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional abdominal pain
      (syndrome; FAP/FAPS). STUDY DESIGN: Baseline data from children with IBS or
      FAP/FAPS who were included in a multicenter trial (NTR2725) in The Netherlands
      were analyzed. Patients' parents completed a questionnaire concerning usage of
      healthcare resources, travel costs, out-of-pocket expenses, productivity loss of 
      parents, and supportive measures at school. Use of abdominal pain related
      prescription medication was derived from case reports forms. Total annual costs
      per patient were calculated as the sum of direct and indirect medical and
      nonmedical costs. Costs of initial diagnostic investigations were not included.
      RESULTS: A total of 258 children, mean age 13.4 years (+/-5.5), were included,
      and 183 (70.9%) were female. Total annual costs per patient were estimated to be 
      euro2512.31. Inpatient and outpatient healthcare use were major cost drivers,
      accounting for 22.5% and 35.2% of total annual costs, respectively. Parental
      productivity loss accounted for 22.2% of total annual costs. No difference was
      found in total costs between children with IBS or FAP/FAPS. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pediatric abdominal pain related functional gastrointestinal disorders impose a
      large economic burden on patients' families and healthcare systems. More than
      one-half of total annual costs of IBS and FAP/FAPS consist of inpatient and
      outpatient healthcare use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Registry:

AB  - This cross-sectional study evaluates the relations between the water load test in
      childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders with food intake and nutritional 
      status. Patients with functional dyspepsia required a lower maximum water intake 
      to produce fullness (n = 11, median = 380 mL) than patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (n = 10, median = 695 mL) or functional abdominal pain (n = 10, median =
      670 mL) (P < 0.05). Among patients who ingested </=560 mL (n = 17) or >560 mL (n 
      = 14) in the water load test, there was no relation between the maximum drinking 
      capacity and food intake, body mass index, or height.

      in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 1339-46
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2015.220 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dysbiosis leading to abnormal intestinal fermentation has been
      suggested as a possible etiological mechanism in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 
      We aimed to investigate the location and magnitude of altered intestinal
      bacterial fermentation in IBS and its clinical subtypes. METHODS: IBS patients
      who satisfied the Rome III criteria (114) and 33 healthy controls (HC) were
      investigated. Intestinal fermentation was assessed using two surrogate measures: 
      intestinal intraluminal pH and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
      Intraluminal pH and intestinal transit times were measured in the small and large
      bowel using a wireless motility capsule (SmartPill) in 47 IBS and 10 HC. Fecal
      SCFAs including acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate were analyzed by
      capillary gas chromatography in all enrolled subjects. Correlations between
      intestinal pH, fecal SCFAs, intestinal transit time, and IBS symptom scores were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Colonic intraluminal pH levels were significantly lower in IBS
      patients compared with HC (total colonic pH, 6.8 for IBS vs. 7.3 for HC,
      P=0.042). There were no differences in total and segmental pH levels in the small
      bowel between IBS patients and HC (6.8 vs. 6.8, P=not significant). The
      intraluminal colonic pH differences were consistent in all IBS subtypes. Total
      SCFA level was significantly lower in C-IBS patients than in D-IBS and M-IBS
      patients and HC. The total SCFA level in all IBS subjects was similar with that
      of HC. Colonic pH levels correlated positively with colon transit time (CTT) and 
      IBS symptoms severity. Total fecal SCFAs levels correlated negatively with CTT
      and positively with stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic intraluminal pH is
      decreased, suggesting higher colonic fermentation, in IBS patients compared with 
      HC. Fecal SCFAs are not a sensitive marker to estimate intraluminal bacterial
      fermentation.

TI  - Maintenance of Pain in Children With Functional Abdominal Pain.
PG  - 393-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000947 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of children with functional abdominal pain
      develop chronic pain. Identifying clinical characteristics predicting pain
      persistence is important in targeting interventions. We examined whether child
      anxiety and/or pain-stooling relations were related to maintenance of abdominal
      pain frequency and compared the predictive value of 3 methods for assessing
      pain-stooling relations (ie, diary, parent report, child report). METHODS:
      Seventy-six children (7-10 years old at baseline) who presented for medical
      treatment of functional abdominal pain were followed up 18 to 24 months later.
      Baseline anxiety and abdominal pain-stooling relations based on pain and stooling
      diaries and child- and parent questionnaires were examined in relationship to the
      persistence of abdominal pain frequency. RESULTS: Children's baseline anxiety was
      not related to persistence of pain frequency. Children who, however, displayed
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms at baseline maintained pain frequency at 
      follow-up, whereas in children in whom there was no relationship between pain and
      stooling, pain frequency decreased. Pain and stool diaries and parent report of
      pain-stooling relations were predictive of pain persistence but child-report
      questionnaires were not. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IBS symptoms in school-age 
      children with functional abdominal pain appears to predict persistence of
      abdominal pain over time, whereas anxiety does not. Prospective pain and stooling
      diaries and parent report of IBS symptoms were predictors of pain maintenance,
      but child report of symptoms was not.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the epidemiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders 
      (FGIDs) in school-aged Salvadoran children using standardized diagnostic
      criteria. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of FGIDs in school-aged children in
      El Salvador. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 395 children participated in the
      study (one public school and one private school). School children completed the
      Spanish version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome 
      III (QPGS-III), an age-appropriate and previously validated instrument for
      diagnosing FGIDs according to the Rome III criteria. Sociodemographic (age, sex, 
      type of school) and familial (family structure and size, family history of
      gastrointestinal disorders) data were obtained. RESULTS: The mean age of the
      sample was 11.8 years +/- 1.6 SD (median 10, range 8-15) and 59% of the
      participants were female. Eighty-one children met the diagnostic criteria for a
      FGID (20%). Defecation disorders were the most common group of FGIDs. Functional 
      constipation was diagnosed in 10% of the children and 9.25% were diagnosed with
      abdominal pain-related FGIDs (most commonly IBS, 3.75%). IBS overlapped with
      functional dyspepsia in 11% of the cases. Children with FGIDs frequently reported
      nausea. Children attending private school and older children had significantly
      more FGIDs than children in public school and younger children. CONCLUSIONS:
      FGIDs are common in school-aged Salvadoran children.

TI  - Mucosa-associated Faecalibacterium prausnitzii phylotype richness is reduced in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7582-92
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02006-15 [doi]
AB  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii depletion in intestinal diseases has been
      extensively reported, but little is known about intraspecies variability. This
      work aims to determine if subjects with gastrointestinal disease host
      mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii populations different from those hosted by
      healthy individuals. A new species-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method targeting the 16S rRNA gene was developed to
      fingerprint F. prausnitzii populations in biopsy specimens from 31 healthy
      control (H) subjects and 36 Crohn's disease (CD), 23 ulcerative colitis (UC), 6
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The
      richness of F. prausnitzii subtypes was lower in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients than in H subjects. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units
      (OTUs) consisted of four phylotypes (OTUs with a 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence
      similarity [OTU99]), which were shared by all groups of patients. Their
      distribution and the presence of some disease-specific F. prausnitzii phylotypes 
      allowed us to differentiate the populations in IBD and CRC patients from that in 
      H subjects. At the level of a minimum similarity of 97% (OTU97), two phylogroups 
      accounted for 98% of the sequences. Phylogroup I was found in 87% of H subjects
      but in under 50% of IBD patients (P = 0.003). In contrast, phylogroup II was
      detected in >75% of IBD patients and in only 52% of H subjects (P = 0.005). This 
      study reveals that even though the main members of the F. prausnitzii population 
      are present in both H subjects and individuals with gut diseases, richness is
      reduced in the latter and an altered phylotype distribution exists between
      diseases. This approach may serve as a basis for addressing the suitability of F.
      prausnitzii phylotypes to be quantified as a putative biomarker of disease and
      depicting the importance of the loss of these subtypes in disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Systematic review: instruments to assess abdominal pain in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 1064-81
LID - 10.1111/apt.13378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consensus on standard methods to assess chronic abdominal pain in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is currently lacking. AIM: To
      systematically review the literature with respect to instruments of measurement
      of chronic abdominal pain in IBS patients. METHODS: Systematic literature search 
      was performed in PubMed/Medline databases for studies using pain measurement
      instruments in patients with IBS. RESULTS: One hundred and ten publications were 
      reviewed. A multitude of different instruments is currently used to assess
      chronic abdominal pain in IBS patients. The single-item methods, e.g. the
      validated 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS), and questionnaires assessing
      gastrointestinal symptoms severity, focus mostly on the assessment of only the
      intensity of abdominal pain. Of these questionnaires, the validated IBS-Symptom
      Severity Scale includes the broadest measurement of pain-related aspects. General
      pain questionnaires and electronic momentary symptom assessment tools have been
      used to study abdominal pain in IBS patients, but have not yet been validated for
      this purpose. The evidence for the use of provocation tests, e.g. the rectal
      barostat with balloon distention, for measurement of abdominal pain in IBS is
      weak, due to the poor correlation between visceral pain thresholds assessed by
      provocation tests and abdominal pain as assessed by retrospective questionnaires.
      CONCLUSIONS: The multitude of different instruments to measure chronic abdominal 
      pain in IBS makes it difficult to compare endpoints of published studies. There
      is need for validated instruments to assess chronic abdominal pain in IBS
      patients, that overcome the limitations of the currently available methods.

TI  - Systemic exposure to menthol following administration of peppermint oil to
      paediatric patients.
PG  - e008375
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008375 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peppermint oil (PMO) has been used to treat abdominal ailments dating 
      to ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. Despite its increasing paediatric use, as in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) treatment, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of menthol in
      children given PMO has not been explored. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-site,
      exploratory pilot study of menthol PK following a single 187 mg dose of PMO.
      Subjects with paediatric Rome II defined (IBS; n=6, male and female, 7-15 years
      of age) were enrolled. Blood samples were obtained before PMO administration and 
      at 10 discrete time points over a 12 h postdose period. Menthol was quantitated
      from plasma using a validated gas chromatography mass spectrometry technique.
      Menthol PK parameters were determined using a standard non-compartmental
      approach. RESULTS: Following a dose of PMO, a substantial lag time (range 1-4 h) 
      was seen in all subjects for the appearance of menthol which in turn, produced a 
      delayed time of peak (Tmax=5.3 +/- 2.4 h) plasma concentration (Cmax=698.2 +/-
      245.4 ng/mL). Tmax and Tlag were significantly more variable than the two
      exposure parameters; Cmax, mean residence time and total area under the curve
      (AUC=4039.7 +/- 583.8 ng/mL x h) which had a coefficient of variation of <20%.
      CONCLUSIONS: Delayed appearance of menthol in plasma after oral PMO
      administration in children is likely a formulation-specific event which, in IBS, 
      could increase intestinal residence time of the active ingredient. Our data also 
      demonstrate the feasibility of using menthol PK in children with IBS to support
      definitive studies of PMO dose-effect relationships.

TI  - PancreApp: An Innovative Approach to Computational Individualization of
      Nutritional Therapy in Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - Medical nutrition therapy has a pivotal role in the management of chronic
      gastrointestinal disorders, like chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel
      diseases (Lesniowski-Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or irritable bowel
      syndrome. The aim of this study is to develop, deploy and evaluate an interactive
      application for Windows and Android operating systems, which could serve as a
      digital diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for the patient 
      and the doctor. The software is gathering details about patients' diet and
      associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals,
      specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the
      process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using 
      a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early
      results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest
      that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric
      interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in
      leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).

TI  - Diet low in FODMAPs reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome as well as
      traditional dietary advice: a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet with reduced content of fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs])
      has been reported to be effective in the treatment of patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no evidence of its superiority to
      traditional dietary advice for these patients. We compared the effects of a diet 
      low in FODMAPs with traditional dietary advice in a randomized controlled trial
      of patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, parallel,
      single-blind study of 75 patients who met Rome III criteria for IBS and were
      enrolled at gastroenterology outpatient clinics in Sweden. Subjects were randomly
      assigned to groups that ate specific diets for 4 weeks-a diet low in FODMAPs (n =
      38) or a diet frequently recommended for patients with IBS (ie, a regular meal
      pattern; avoidance of large meals; and reduced intake of fat, insoluble fibers,
      caffeine, and gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, and onions), with
      greater emphasis on how and when to eat rather than on what foods to ingest (n = 
      37). Symptom severity was assessed using the IBS Symptom Severity Scale, and
      patients completed a 4-day food diary before and at the end of the intervention. 
      RESULTS: A total of 67 patients completed the dietary intervention (33 completed 
      the diet low in FODMAPs, 34 completed the traditional IBS diet). The severity of 
      IBS symptoms was reduced in both groups during the intervention (P < .0001 in
      both groups before vs at the end of the 4-week diet), without a significant
      difference between the groups (P = .62). At the end of the 4-week diet period, 19
      patients (50%) in the low-FODMAP group had reductions in IBS severity scores
      >/=50 compared with baseline vs 17 patients (46%) in the traditional IBS diet
      group (P = .72). Food diaries demonstrated good adherence to the dietary advice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet low in FODMAPs reduces IBS symptoms as well as traditional
      IBS dietary advice. Combining elements from these 2 strategies might further
      reduce symptoms of IBS. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02107625.

TI  - The role of vitamin D in reducing gastrointestinal disease risk and assessment of
      individual dietary intake needs: Focus on genetic and genomic technologies.
PG  - 119-33
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201500243 [doi]
AB  - With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because 
      of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary
      sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing
      susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal
      cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel
      syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such
      diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake
      overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have
      revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature 
      of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating
      vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data,
      including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a
      position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
      proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency
      has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for
      considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary
      supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might
      beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for
      optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.

TI  - Current concepts in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 619-24
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000262 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are some of the 
      most common and challenging disorders in pediatrics. Recurrent abdominal pain is 
      the central feature of pain-associated FGIDs such as irritable bowel syndrome. A 
      thorough understanding of current pathophysiological concepts is essential to
      successful management. RECENT FINDINGS: The brain-gut axis, role of microbiota
      and the biopsychosocial model are emerging concepts in FGIDs. The biopsychosocial
      model focuses on the interplay between genes, environment, and physical and
      psychosocial factors. Interactions between microbiota and the central, enteric
      and autonomic nervous systems form the link between gut functions and conscious
      perceptions. Irritable bowel syndrome is the most extensively studied and
      prototypical pain-associated FGIDs. An aberrant processing of pain or physiologic
      signals originating from the gut causes a state of visceral hypersensitivity - a 
      central mechanism of functional pain. Psychosocial and autonomic influences also 
      play large roles. Therapy is tailored to the individual patient and comorbid
      symptoms. SUMMARY: This review highlights the complex mechanisms and the aberrant
      brain-gut neural connections forming the basis of FGIDs. Successful management of
      FGIDs requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology coupled with a
      multidisciplinary treatment approach. Management should focus on cognitive
      behavioral therapy, dietary factors along with gastrointestinal motility and
      psychotropic drug therapy.

TI  - Specific inhibition of bile acid transport alters plasma lipids and GLP-1.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/s12872-015-0070-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elobixibat is a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter
      (IBAT) inhibitor in development against chronic constipation (CC) and
      constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C). CC is associated with 
      an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. The
      objectives of this study were to evaluate metabolic effects of elobixibat.
      Effects on plasma lipids and BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week,
      placebo-controlled study in patients with dyslipidemia while changes of
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by elobixibat was assayed in samples from a 14
      day high-dose elobixibat study in patients with CC. METHODS: Thirty-six
      dyslipidemic patients, 21 females, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg
      or 5 mg elobixibat or placebo once daily for four weeks. The primary endpoint was
      the change in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary endpoints
      included other lipid parameters and serum 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), 
      a marker of BA (bile acid) synthesis. Another study, in 36 patients with CC
      treated with high dose elobixibat; 15 mg or 20 mg/day or placebo for 14 days, was
      evaluated for changes in GLP-1. RESULTS: In the dyslipidemia study LDL
      cholesterol was reduced by 7.4 % (p = 0.044), and the LDL/HDL ratio was decreased
      by 18 % (p = 0.004). Serum C4 increased, indicating that BA synthesis was
      induced. No serious adverse events were recorded. In the CC study, GLP-1
      increased significantly in both the 15 mg (20.7 +/- 2.4 pmol/L; p = 0.03) and the
      20 mg group (25.6 +/- 4.9 pmol/L; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Elobixibat reduces LDL 
      cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratio and increase circulating peak GLP-1 levels, the
      latter in line with increased intestinal BA mediated responses in humans. TRIAL

TI  - Potential role of the intestinal microbiota in programming health and disease.
PG  - 32-40
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuv039 [doi]
AB  - The composition of the microbiota varies according to prenatal events, delivery
      methods, infant feeding, infant care environment, and antibiotic use. Postnatal
      gut function and immune development are largely influenced by the intestinal
      microbiota. Emerging evidence has shown that early microbiota colonization may
      influence the occurrence of later diseases (microbial programming). The vast
      majority of microbial species (commensals) give rise to symbiotic host-bacterial 
      interactions that are fundamental for human health. However, changes in the
      composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may be associated with several
      clinical conditions, including obesity and metabolic diseases, autoimmune
      diseases and allergy, acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and 
      allergic IBS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on recent advances,
      modulation of gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or fermented dairy
      products has been suggested as a treatment of, or prevention for, different
      disorders such as IBS, infectious diarrhea, allergic disease, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis.

TI  - Evaluation Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms Amongst Warsaw University
      Students.
PG  - 252-9

AB  - UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) belongs to functional gastrointestinal
      disorders and is characterized by abdominal pain and change in stool consistency 
      and/or bowel habits. Etiological factors include gastrointestinal peristalsis
      disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, chronic inflammation of the mucous
      membrane, dysbacteremia, intestinal infections, psychosomatic and nutritional
      factors. Gastrointestinal motility disturbances in case of IBS are manifested by 
      the inhibition of the intestinal passage, which favors the development of
      constipation or occurrence of diarrhea. The aim of the study was to evaluate IBS 
      symptoms and demonstrate the relationship between physical activity and place of 
      residence amongst Warsaw University students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was
      conducted in march, 2014 using a specific questionnaire, amongst Warsaw
      University students. The study group comprised 120 female patients, aged between 
      19 and 27 years (M=23.43; SD=1.29). The chi-square test was used for analysis,
      p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The BMI of
      investigated patients ranged between 16.30-31.22 kg/m2 (M=21.27; SD=2.71). The
      majority of respondents (76.6%) weighed within the normal limits. Abdominal pain 
      or discomfort occurred more frequently in the group of students who considered
      their physical activity as low. In case of respondents with a low physical
      activity bowel movement disorders and stool continence changes occurred more
      often, as compared to those with moderate physical activity. The most common
      symptom was rectal tenesmus, the least common-presence of mucous in the stool.
      Analysis showed that students with low physical activity were more frequently
      absent from school/work, due to abdominal symptoms. The respondents with moderate
      activity more often considered their abdominal symptoms, being associated with
      stress. CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms are common amongst Warsaw University students. 
      In case of respondents with low physical activity, abdominal pain or discomfort
      occurred more often. It has been demonstrated that diet and stress might
      contribute to the occurrence of abdominal symptoms, being evidence of IBS.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: gut microbiome biomarkers are associated with clinical
      response to a low FODMAP diet in children with the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 418-27
LID - 10.1111/apt.13286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet can ameliorate symptoms in adult irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) within 48 h. AIM: To determine the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet
      in childhood IBS and whether gut microbial composition and/or metabolic capacity 
      are associated with its efficacy. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover trial,
      children with Rome III IBS completed a 1-week baseline period. They then were
      randomised to a low FODMAP diet or typical American childhood diet (TACD),
      followed by a 5-day washout period before crossing over to the other diet. GI
      symptoms were assessed with abdominal pain frequency being the primary outcome.
      Baseline gut microbial composition (16S rRNA sequencing) and metabolic capacity
      (PICRUSt) were determined. Metagenomic biomarker discovery (LEfSe) compared
      Responders (>/=50% decrease in abdominal pain frequency on low FODMAP diet only) 
      vs. Nonresponders (no improvement during either intervention). RESULTS:
      Thirty-three children completed the study. Less abdominal pain occurred during
      the low FODMAP diet vs. TACD [1.1 +/- 0.2 (SEM) episodes/day vs. 1.7 +/- 0.4, P <
      0.05]. Compared to baseline (1.4 +/- 0.2), children had fewer daily abdominal
      pain episodes during the low FODMAP diet (P < 0.01) but more episodes during the 
      TACD (P < 0.01). Responders were enriched at baseline in taxa with known greater 
      saccharolytic metabolic capacity (e.g. Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae,
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and three Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
      orthologues, of which two relate to carbohydrate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In
      childhood IBS, a low FODMAP diet decreases abdominal pain frequency. Gut
      microbiome biomarkers may be associated with low FODMAP diet efficacy.

TI  - Diagnosis of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS): The Salerno Experts' Criteria.
PG  - 4966-77
LID - 10.3390/nu7064966 [doi]
AB  - Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal
      and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food,
      in subjects that are not affected by either celiac disease or wheat allergy.
      Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the
      procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts'
      recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the
      confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical
      response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten
      challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is
      performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version
      of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three
      main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale
      with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten
      challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout 
      of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle 
      should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 
      30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge
      should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The
      guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and
      positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies,
      if adopted internationally.

TI  - The severity of inflammation at onset of ulcerative colitis is not associated
      with IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.
PG  - 776-83
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 
      common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has
      been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes
      comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of
      UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.
      METHODS: In total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively
      for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset 
      of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for
      IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not
      (UCR-IBS). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical
      remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during
      follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the
      initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing
      UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe
      gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare. 
      CONCLUSION: The severity and extent of inflammation at onset of UC do not seem to
      affect the development of IBS-like symptoms in UC patients during clinical
      remission. The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms is not explained by
      pre-existing IBS. UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms
      at disease onset, which might indicate a more sensitive gastrointestinal tract in
      this category of patients.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is an undefined syndrome with gastrointestinal and 
      extra-intestinal manifestations triggered by gluten in patients without celiac
      disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis involves immune-mediated mechanisms
      requiring further research. Symptoms disappear in a few hours or days after
      gluten withdrawal and recur rapidly after gluten ingestion. Besides gluten, other
      wheat proteins as well as fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols
      (FODMAPs) may contribute to this syndrome. This syndrome occurs mainly in young
      women, being rare in children. Its prevalence ranges from 0.6% to 6%, based on
      primary or tertiary care center estimates. No biomarker is available, but half of
      patients tests positive for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, which disappear quickly 
      after gluten-free diet together with symptoms. Also, genetic markers are still
      undefined. Although currently limited to a research setting, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over trial strategy is recommended to confirm the
      diagnosis. Treatment is based on dietary restriction with special care to
      nutrient intake.

TI  - Visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome: evidence for involvement
      of serotonin metabolism--a preliminary study.
PG  - 1127-37
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12600 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and visceral perception have
      been associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Aim of
      this preliminary study was to assess the effect of the direct precursor of 5-HT, 
      5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on systemic 5-HT metabolites and visceral perception
      and to assess potential differential responses between IBS and controls. METHODS:
      15 IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomized
      double-blind placebo controlled study. Visceroperception was measured by rectal
      barostat. The 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo was ingested orally. Serotonergic
      metabolites were assessed in platelet poor plasma. KEY RESULTS: 5-HTP induces
      rectal allodynia in a significant number of healthy controls; IBS patients
      exhibit lowered pain thresholds in both placebo and 5-HTP conditions. 5-HTP
      induces rectal hyperalgesia in hypersensitive but not in non-hypersensitive IBS
      patients. Administration of 5-HTP significantly increased plasma 5-HTP levels (p 
      < 0.001), did not affect 5-HT levels (p > 0.05), while levels of the main
      metabolite of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, increased significantly (p <
      0.05) in both groups. The magnitude of these changes observed in 5-HT metabolites
      was significantly greater in IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Oral
      administration of 5-HTP induced significant alterations in systemic 5-HT
      metabolites that were accompanied by increased visceroperception of pain in
      controls and hypersensitive IBS patients. Changes in 5-HT metabolism appear to be
      important factors involved in visceral hypersensitivity as the 5-HTP-induced
      pro-nociceptive response was observed in all hypersensitive IBS patients and to a
      lesser magnitude in a significant number of healthy controls but in none of the
      non-hypersensitive IBS patients.

      and diseased subjects.
PG  - e0126685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126685 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale cohort studies are currently being designed to investigate the human 
      microbiome in health and disease. Adequate sampling strategies are required to
      limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage.
      Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on
      the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects.
      Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8
      inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately
      after defecation and stored at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C for 1 week, at +4
      degrees C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab,
      Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used
      pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial
      communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80
      degrees C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate 
      analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p < 0.001) but not by
      storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a
      significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80 degrees C versus the
      other methods and -80 degrees C samples (p < 0.009). The relative abundance of
      Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods
      versus -80 degrees C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p < 0.05). Storage up to 24 
      hours (at +4 degrees C or room temperature) or freezing at -20 degrees C did not 
      significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct
      freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal
      disorders.

TI  - Symptom Profiles in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Functional
      Abdominal Pain Compared With Healthy Controls.
PG  - 323-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000795 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of gastrointestinal symptoms 
      are recommended to determine treatment effects for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      and functional abdominal pain (FAP). Study objectives were to compare the symptom
      profiles of pediatric patients with IBS or FAP with healthy controls and with
      each other using the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry 
      Scales, and to establish clinical interpretability of PRO scale scores through
      identification of minimal important difference (MID) scores. METHODS:
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by
      154 pediatric patients and 161 parents (162 families; IBS n = 46, FAP n = 119).
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when 
      eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea
      and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were
      administered along with Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A matched sample of 447
      families with healthy children completed the scales. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between patients with IBS or FAP compared
      with healthy controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes (>1.50) for symptoms 
      indicative of IBS or FAP, demonstrating a broad multidimensional gastrointestinal
      symptom profile and clinical interpretability with MID scores for individual PRO 
      scales. Patients with IBS manifested more symptoms of constipation, gas and
      bloating, and diarrhea than patients with FAP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS or 
      FAP manifested a broad gastrointestinal symptom profile compared with healthy
      controls with large differences, indicating the critical need for more effective 
      interventions to bring patient functioning within the range of healthy
      functioning.

PG  - 424-30
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000869 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcomes are necessary to evaluate the
      gastrointestinal symptom profile of patients with functional constipation. Study 
      objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptom profile of pediatric
      patients with functional constipation with matched healthy controls with the
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Gastrointestinal Worry Scales and to establish clinical interpretability in
      functional constipation through identification of minimal important difference
      (MID) scores. The secondary objective compared the symptom profile of patients
      with functional constipation with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      METHODS: Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site
      study by 116 pediatric patients with functional constipation and 188 parents.
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when 
      eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea
      and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were
      administered along with Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A total of 341 families
      with healthy children and 43 families with patients with IBS completed the
      scales. RESULTS: A broad profile of gastrointestinal symptoms and worry were
      reported by patients with functional constipation in comparison with healthy
      controls (P < 0.001) with large effect sizes (>0.80) across the majority of
      symptom domains. Patients with IBS manifested a broader symptom profile than
      functional constipation, with differences for stomach pain, stomach discomfort
      when eating, and worry about stomachaches, with similar constipation scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with functional constipation report a broad
      gastrointestinal symptom profile in comparison with healthy controls and only
      somewhat fewer symptoms than patients with IBS, highlighting the critical need
      for more efficacious interventions to achieve healthy functioning.

TI  - Agreement between prospective diary data and retrospective questionnaire report
      of abdominal pain and stooling symptoms in children with irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 1110-9
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12590 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In functional gastrointestinal disorders, patient recall of symptoms 
      drives diagnostic decisions and evaluation of treatment response, and research
      conclusions about potential treatments. In pediatrics, parent report also impacts
      assessment and care. Hence, identifying methods for accurately capturing patient 
      and parent report of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms is important. This
      study evaluated correspondence between retrospective questionnaire (parent and
      child report) and prospective diary data for children and adolescents with IBS.
      METHODS: Participants included 50 children/adolescents with IBS per Rome III
      criteria. Children completed a 2-week pain and stool diary. Children and parents 
      subsequently completed a 2-week recall questionnaire, reporting number of pain
      days, maximum pain, days without bowel movement, and days with diarrhea during
      the diary interval. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots
      assessed agreement. KEY RESULTS: For pain and days without bowel movement,
      overall agreement between child recall questionnaire and child diary was strong, 
      although under conditions likely to facilitate agreement and with individual
      variation observed. Parent recall and child diary were less concordant, and
      agreement about diarrhea was poor for parent and child. Age did not significantly
      correlate with agreement. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Child questionnaire with
      short recall interval may be a reasonable approximation for diary data, although 
      this varies by individual and replication/investigation of lengthier recall are
      needed. Relying on parent questionnaire does not appear a suitable proxy, and
      recall of stool form by both parent and child appears more problematic. These
      results combined with existing literature support use of diary data whenever
      possible.

PG  - 792-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000714 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several cross-sectional surveys have been conducted to study the
      prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in children. The aim of the present 
      study was to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of published
      literature to estimate the prevalence of IBS among Asian children. METHOD: A
      computer-assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and regional databases of 
      Asia was carried out. Selected articles were reviewed in depth and data were
      extracted. Pooled prevalence, sex differences, and 95% confidence intervals were 
      calculated. Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I(2) test.
      RESULTS: A total of 16 cross-sectional studies that reported prevalence of IBS
      (in children and adolescents) and qualified to be included were taken into the
      final analysis containing 38,076 patients. Selected studies are from China,
      Korea, Japan, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Saudi Arabia. Studies showed a marked
      heterogeneity with I(2) of 98.59 (P < 0.0001). Prevalence of IBS ranges from 2.8%
      to 25.7%, with a pooled prevalence of 12.41% (95% confidence interval
      9.87-14.95). Prevalence risk ratio of girl:boy is 1.39. Prevalence of subtypes is
      diverse and varies between studies. CONCLUSIONS: The published data indicate that
      IBS is a significant problem among Asian children and adolescents. Female sex
      predisposes children and adolescents to develop IBS.

PG  - e0126982
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126982 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review the literature regarding epidemiology of functional
      abdominal pain disorders in children and to assess its geographic, gender and age
      distribution including associated risk factors of developing functional abdominal
      pain. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychInfo
      databases were systematically searched up to February 2014. Study selection
      criteria included: (1) studies of birth cohort, school based or general
      population samples (2) containing data concerning epidemiology, prevalence or
      incidence (3) of children aged 4-18 years (4) suffering from functional abdominal
      pain. Quality of studies was rated by a self-made assessment tool. A
      random-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate the prevalence of
      functional abdominal pain in childhood. RESULTS: A total of 58 articles,
      including 196,472 children were included. Worldwide pooled prevalence for
      functional abdominal pain disorders was 13.5% (95% CI 11.8-15.3), of which
      irritable bowel syndrome was reported most frequently (8.8%, 95% CI 6.2-11.9).
      The prevalence across studies ranged widely from 1.6% to 41.2%. Higher pooled
      prevalence rates were reported in South America (16.8%) and Asia (16.5%) compared
      to Europe (10.5%). And a higher pooled prevalence was reported when using the
      Rome III criteria (16.4%, 95% CI 13.5-19.4). Functional abdominal pain disorders 
      are shown to occur significantly more in girls (15.9% vs. 11.5%, pooled OR 1.5)
      and is associated with the presence of anxiety and depressive disorders, stress
      and traumatic life events. CONCLUSION: Functional abdominal pain disorders are a 
      common problem worldwide with irritable bowel syndrome as most encountered
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder. Female gender,
      psychological disorders, stress and traumatic life events affect prevalence.

AB  - The community of microorganisms within the human gut (or microbiota) is critical 
      to health and functions with a level of complexity comparable to that of an organ
      system. Alterations of this ecology (or dysbiosis) have been implicated in a
      number of disease states, and the prototypical example is Clostridium difficile
      infection (CDI). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been demonstrated to 
      durably alter the gut microbiota of the recipient and has shown efficacy in the
      treatment of patients with recurrent CDI. There is hope that FMT may eventually
      prove beneficial for the treatment of other diseases associated with alterations 
      in gut microbiota, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, 
      and metabolic syndrome, to name a few. Although the basic principles that
      underlie the mechanisms by which FMT shows therapeutic efficacy in CDI are
      becoming apparent, further research is needed to understand the possible role of 
      FMT in these other conditions. Although relatively simple to perform, questions
      regarding both short-term and long-term safety as well as the complex and rapidly
      evolving regulatory landscape has limited widespread use. Future work will focus 
      on establishing best practices and more robust safety data than exist currently, 
      as well as refining FMT beyond current "whole-stool" transplants to increase
      safety and tolerability. Encapsulated formulations, full-spectrum stool-based
      products, and defined microbial consortia are all in the immediate future.

TI  - The intestinal barrier in irritable bowel syndrome: subtype-specific effects of
      the systemic compartment in an in vitro model.
PG  - e0123498
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0123498 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder with multifactorial
      pathophysiology. Intestinal barrier may be altered, especially in
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Several mediators may contribute to increased
      intestinal permeability in IBS. AIM: We aimed to assess effects of tryptase and
      LPS on in vitro permeability using a 3-dimensional cell model after basolateral
      cell exposure. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which these mediators in
      IBS plasma play a role in intestinal barrier function. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Caco-2 cells were grown in extracellular matrix to develop into polarized
      spheroids and were exposed to tryptase (10 - 50 mU), LPS (1 - 50 ng/mL) and
      two-fold diluted plasma samples of 7 patients with IBS-D, 7 with
      constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and 7 healthy controls (HC). Barrier
      function was assessed by the flux of FITC-dextran (FD4) using live cell imaging. 
      Furthermore, plasma tryptase and LPS were determined. RESULTS: Tryptase (20 and
      50 mU) and LPS (6.25 - 50 ng/mL) significantly increased Caco-2 permeability
      versus control (all P< 0.05). Plasma of IBS-D only showed significantly elevated 
      median tryptase concentrations (7.1 [3.9 - 11.0] vs. 4.2 [2.2 - 7.0] vs. 4.2 [2.5
      - 5.9] mug/mL; P<0.05) and LPS concentrations (3.65 [3.00 - 6.10] vs. 3.10
      [2.60-3.80] vs. 2.65 [2.40 - 3.40] EU/ml; P< 0.05) vs. IBS-C and HC. Also, plasma
      of IBS-D increased Caco-2 permeability versus HC (0.14450 +/- 0.00472 vs. 0.00021
      +/- 0.00003; P < 0.001), which was attenuated by selective inhibition of tryptase
      and LPS (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Basolateral exposure of spheroids to plasma of
      IBS-D patients resulted in a significantly increased FD4 permeation, which was
      partially abolished by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS. These findings
      point to a role of systemic tryptase and LPS in the epithelial barrier
      alterations observed in patients with IBS-D.

TI  - Deviations in human gut microbiota: a novel diagnostic test for determining
      dysbiosis in patients with IBS or IBD.
PG  - 71-83
LID - 10.1111/apt.13236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis is associated with many diseases, including irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), obesity and diabetes.
      Potential clinical impact of imbalance in the intestinal microbiota suggests need
      for new standardised diagnostic methods to facilitate microbiome profiling. AIM: 
      To develop and validate a novel diagnostic test using faecal samples to profile
      the intestinal microbiota and identify and characterise dysbiosis. METHODS:
      Fifty-four DNA probes targeting >/=300 bacteria on different taxonomic levels
      were selected based on ability to distinguish between healthy controls and IBS
      patients in faecal samples. Overall, 165 healthy controls (normobiotic reference 
      collection) were used to develop a dysbiosis model with a bacterial profile and
      Dysbiosis Index score output. The model algorithmically assesses faecal bacterial
      abundance and profile, and potential clinically relevant deviation in the
      microbiome from normobiosis. This model was tested in different samples from
      healthy volunteers and IBS and IBD patients (n = 330) to determine the ability to
      detect dysbiosis. RESULTS: Validation confirms dysbiosis was detected in 73% of
      IBS patients, 70% of treatment-naive IBD patients and 80% of IBD patients in
      remission, vs. 16% of healthy individuals. Comparison of deep sequencing and the 
      GA-map Dysbiosis Test, (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo, Norway) illustrated good
      agreement in bacterial capture; the latter showing higher resolution by targeting
      pre-determined highly relevant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The GA-map Dysbiosis Test
      identifies and characterises dysbiosis in IBS and IBD patients, and provides
      insight into a patient's intestinal microbiota. Evaluating microbiota as a
      diagnostic strategy may allow monitoring of prescribed treatment regimens and
      improvement in new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Glutamine Restores Tight Junction Protein Claudin-1 Expression in Colonic Mucosa 
      of Patients With Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 1170-1176
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed that patients with diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) had an increased intestinal permeability as well
      as a decreased expression of tight junctions. Glutamine, the major substrate of
      rapidly dividing cells, is able to modulate intestinal permeability and tight
      junction expression in other diseases. We aimed to evaluate, ex vivo, glutamine
      effects on tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, in the colonic mucosa
      of patients with IBS-D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with IBS-D,
      diagnosed with the Rome III criteria, were included (8 women/4 men, aged 40.7 +/-
      6.9 years). Colonic biopsy specimens were collected and immediately incubated for
      18 hours in culture media with increasing concentrations of glutamine from 0.6-10
      mmol/L. Claudin-1 and occludin expression was then measured by immunoblot, and
      concentrations of cytokines were assessed by multiplex technology. Claudin-1
      expression was affected by glutamine (P < .05, analysis of variance). In
      particularly, 10 mmol/L glutamine increased claudin-1 expression compared with
      0.6 mmol/L glutamine (0.47 +/- 0.04 vs 0.33 +/- 0.03, P < .05). In contrast,
      occludin expression was not significantly modified by glutamine. Interestingly,
      glutamine effect was negatively correlated to claudin-1 (Pearson r = -0.83, P <
      .001) or occludin basal expression (Pearson r = -0.84, P < .001), suggesting that
      glutamine had more marked effects when tight junction protein expression was
      altered. Cytokine concentrations in culture media were not modified by glutamine 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Glutamine increased claudin-1 expression in the colonic
      mucosa of patients with IBS-D. In addition, glutamine effect seems to be
      dependent on basal expression of tight junction proteins.

TI  - No Effects of a Short-Term Gluten-free Diet on Performance in Nonceliac Athletes.
PG  - 2563-70
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000699 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Implementation of gluten-free diets among nonceliac athletes has rapidly
      increased in recent years because of perceived ergogenic and health benefits. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on
      exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being,
      intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS:
      Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive
      clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome
      (mean +/- SD; age, 32 +/- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +/- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +/- 11.8 
      cm, VO2max 59.1 +/- 8.0 mL.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1)) were allocated to a 7-d
      gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, 
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either
      gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while
      habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet,
      cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI 
      questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a
      submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time
      trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to
      determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers 
      (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze
      data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between 
      the GCD (245.4 +/- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +/- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during
      exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There
      were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13)
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI
      symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory
      markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.

      uninvestigated dyspepsia.
PG  - 443-8
LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12260 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The clinical spectrum of celiac disease (CeD) is wide and its symptoms
      overlap with those of functional bowel diseases. This study aimed to investigate 
      the relationship among gluten-related disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      and uninvestigated dyspepsia in Indian patients. METHODS: Patients with IBS and
      uninvestigated dyspepsia (using Rome III criteria) were tested for immunoglobulin
      A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody and anti-gliadin
      antibody (AGA). Those with positive anti-tTG antibody were evaluated for the
      presence of villous abnormalities. Patients who were only IgA AGA-positive were
      considered to have gluten sensitivity and those with positive anti-tTG antibody
      and villous atrophy were considered to have CeD. RESULTS: Of 362 patients with
      IBS, 22 (6.1%) had positive anti-tTG antibody, among whom 3 (0.8%) had CeD and 19
      had potential CeD. Of 358 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, 18 (5.0%) were 
      anti-tTG antibody-positive and among them 4 (1.1%) had CeD and 14 had potential
      CeD. AGA was positive in 104 (28.7%) patients with IBS and 68 (19.0%) with
      uninvestigated dyspepsia, suggesting the presence of gluten sensitivity.
      CONCLUSION: This study highlights the relationship between IBS or dyspepsia and
      CeD or gluten sensitivity.

TI  - Gut microbiota as potential orchestrators of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 318-31
LID - 10.5009/gnl14344 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial functional disorder with no
      clearly defined etiology or pathophysiology. Modern culture-independent
      techniques have improved the understanding of the gut microbiota's composition
      and demonstrated that an altered gut microbiota profile might be found in at
      least some subgroups of IBS patients. Research on IBS from a microbial
      perspective is gaining momentum and advancing. This review will therefore
      highlight potential links between the gut microbiota and IBS by discussing the
      current knowledge of the gut microbiota; it will also illustrate bacterial-host
      interactions and how alterations to these interactions could exacerbate, induce
      or even help alleviate IBS.

TI  - Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Obese Patients. The Importance of the
      Enrollment Source.
PG  - 2143-52
LID - 10.1007/s11695-015-1679-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is frequently associated to many functional gastrointestinal 
      disorders. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of
      functional gastrointestinal disorders in obese patients, according to their body 
      mass index and their recruitment source. METHODS: Five hundred ninety-six obese
      patients (body mass index (BMI) > 30) filled out a standard questionnaire in
      order to evaluate the presence of functional gastrointestinal disorders. They
      were divided into four groups according to the Rome III criteria and their BMI:
      OF, obese patients from functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) enrollment;
      OO, obese patients from obesity management enrollment; MF, morbid obesity
      patients from FGID enrollment; and MO, morbid obesity patients from obesity
      management enrollment. Data analysis was performed using multivariate logistic
      regression. RESULTS: Out of the 596 obese patients included in the present study,
      183 (33 %) were complaining of FGIDs, while 413 (67 %) were consulting for
      obesity management. Compared to the OF group, the OO patients had a higher
      prevalence of females (P = 0.008) and a younger age (P < 0.001). Clinically, they
      reported a lower incidence of regurgitation (P = 0.044), of chest pain (P =
      0.004), of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; P = 0.035), and of functional diarrhea 
      (P = 0.030). Compared to the MF group, the MO patients had an older age (P =
      0.001), a higher BMI (P = 0.013), and clinically by a high frequency of
      functional dyspepsia (P = 0.006). There were symptoms that had similar prevalence
      in all groups (OF, OO, MF, MO) such as epigastric pain, postprandial distress,
      constipation, diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain soiling, or nonspecific
      anorectal disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the recruitment
      source accounted for marked and specific differences in the prevalence of
      functional gastrointestinal disorders in obesity and morbid obesity. Symptoms
      with similar prevalence in all groups should be systematically detected in all
      patients.

TI  - Systematic review: dietary fibre and FODMAP-restricted diet in the management of 
      constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1256-70
LID - 10.1111/apt.13167 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fibre supplements have been advocated for the management of
      chronic constipation (CC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recently, a
      fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)
      restricted diet has been recommended for IBS. AIM: To systematically examine
      recent evidence for dietary interventions with fibre in CC and IBS and
      FODMAP-restricted diet in IBS, and provide recommendations. METHODS: We searched 
      PUBMED, MEDLINE, OVID and COCHRANE databases from 2004 to 2014. Published studies
      in adults with CC and IBS and constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) that compared 
      fibre with placebo/alternative and FODMAP-restricted diet with alternative were
      included. RESULTS: Of 550 potentially eligible clinical trials on fibre, 11
      studies were found and of 23 potentially eligible studies on FODMAPs, six were
      found. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity and methodological 
      quality. Fibre was beneficial in 5/7 studies in CC and 3/3 studies in IBS-C.
      FODMAP-restricted diet improved overall IBS symptoms in 4/4 and IBS-C symptoms in
      1/3 studies and three studies did not meet inclusion criteria. There were
      significant disparities in subject selection, interventions and outcome
      assessments in both fibre and FODMAPs studies. CONCLUSIONS: Fibre supplementation
      is beneficial in mild to moderate CC and IBS-C, although larger, more rigorous
      and long-term RCTs are needed (Fair evidence-Level II, Grade B). Although the
      FODMAP-restricted diet may be effective in short-term management of selected
      patients with IBS (Fair evidence-Level II, Grade C) and IBS-C (Poor
      evidence-Level III, Grade C), more rigorous trials are needed to establish
      long-term efficacy and safety, particularly on colonic health and microbiome.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness and economic costs of group versus one-to-one education
      for short-chain fermentable carbohydrate restriction (low FODMAP diet) in the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 687-96
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restriction of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) is an effective dietary treatment for
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patient dietary education is essential but labour
      intensive. Group FODMAP education may alleviate this somewhat but has not
      previously been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical
      effectiveness of low FODMAP group education in patients with IBS and to explore
      the cost of a group pathway. METHODS: Patients with IBS (n = 364) were assessed
      for their suitability to attend dietitian-led group education or traditional
      one-to-one education in a novel group pathway. Clinical effectiveness (global
      symptom question, symptom prevalence, stool output) were compared at baseline and
      follow-up using the chi-squared test. The costs of the novel group pathway were
      assessed using a decision model. RESULTS: The global symptom question indicated
      more patients were satisfied with their symptoms following dietary advice, in
      both group education [baseline 48/263 (18%) versus follow-up 142/263 (54%), P <
      0.001] and one-to-one education [baseline 5/101 (5%) versus follow-up 61/101
      (60%), P < 0.001], with no difference between group and one-to-one education at
      follow-up (P = 0.271). Overall, there was a significant decrease in symptom
      severity from baseline to follow-up (P < 0.001 for both groups) but no difference
      in symptom response between group and one-to-one education. The cost for the
      group education pathway for all 364 patients was pound31 713.36. CONCLUSIONS: The
      present study shows that dietitian-led FODMAP group education is clinically
      effective and the costs associated with a FODMAP group pathway are worthy of
      further consideration for routine clinical care.

TI  - Abdominal pain endpoints currently recommended by the FDA and EMA for adult
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome may not be reliable in children.
PG  - 849-55
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended >/=30% decrease on
      patient-reported outcomes for pain be considered clinically significant in
      clinical trials for adults with irritable bowel syndrome. This percent change
      approach may not be appropriate for children. We compared three alternate
      approaches to determining clinically significant reductions in pain among
      children. METHODS: 80 children with functional abdominal pain participated in a
      study of the efficacy of amitriptyline. Endpoints included patient-reported
      estimates of feeling better, and pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The minimum
      clinically important difference in pain report was calculated as (i) mean change 
      in VAS score for children reporting being 'better'; (ii) percent changes in pain 
      (>/=30% and >/=50%) on the VAS; and (iii) statistically reliable changes on the
      VAS for 68% and 95% confidence intervals. KEY RESULTS: There was poor agreement
      between the three approaches. 43.6% of the children who met the FDA >/=30%
      criterion for clinically significant change did not achieve a reliable level of
      improvement (95% confidence interval). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Children's
      self-reported ratings of being better may not be statistically reliable. A
      combined approach in which children must report improvement as better and achieve
      a statistically significant change may be more appropriate for outcomes in
      clinical trials.

TI  - More similarities than differences between men and women with irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 796-804
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12551 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences regarding symptoms, coping abilities, and quality of life
      (QOL) between men and women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been
      reported but data are sparse and sometimes conflicting. The aim of present study 
      was to investigate gender differences in gastrointestinal, extra-intestinal, and 
      psychological symptoms, and sense of coherence (SOC) and QOL in a large group of 
      patients diagnosed with IBS. METHODS: We analyzed questionnaire data from 557
      patients (152 men) diagnosed with IBS consecutively included in studies at an
      outpatient clinic for functional bowel disorders between 2002 and 2010. Following
      questionnaires were included: IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), IBSQOL Scale, Visceral Sensitivity Index
      (VSI), SOC Scale, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ-15). KEY RESULTS: Women had harder stools (FDR-adjusted
      p-value: q = 0.033), more severe bloating (q = 0.020), higher symptom severity (q
      = 0.042), higher total somatic symptom burden (q = 0.035), lower SOC (q = 0.042),
      and lower QOL. Women rated more general anxiety (q = 0.017) and
      gastrointestinal-specific anxiety (q = 0.042), but there were no group
      differences in depression, pain, stool frequency, impact on daily life,
      dissatisfaction with bowel habit, or extra-colonic symptoms. The differences
      found were small (effect sizes: r < 0.3). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In this
      study, we demonstrated more similarities than differences between men and women
      with IBS. The largest difference were seen for QOL which might reflect certain
      structural stressors to which women in general are more exposed than men.

TI  - The use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature
      and recommendations by Latin-American experts.
PG  - 199-216
LID - 10.1007/s40272-015-0124-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role
      in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50
      years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic
      administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a
      recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology,
      together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits,
      tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without
      study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled
      studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics,
      diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea,
      bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter
      pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the 
      quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence
      were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the
      updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of
      RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort
      studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for
      SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert
      group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric
      gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b
      for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri;
      prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and
      Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for
      L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S.
      boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of 
      infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b
      for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of
      Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; 
      induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3;
      improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.

TI  - Fibromyalgia and nutrition: what news?
PG  - S117-25
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic, generalised pain condition usually
      accompanied by several associated symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance,
      headache, irritable bowel syndrome and mood disorders. Different medical
      treatments are used to treat fibromyalgia and the recent guidelines suggest that 
      the optimal treatment consists in a multidisciplinary approach with a combination
      of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. Among
      non-pharmacological treatment, nutrition is a promising tool for FM patients. The
      aim of this review is to update the present knowledge about fibromyalgia and
      nutrition by means of a systematic search performed on Medline from January 2000 
      to December 2014. Nutritional deficiencies have been described in FM patients and
      the benefits of specific diet and nutritional supplementation are shown. Obesity 
      and overweight, often present in FM patients, are related to the severity of FM
      worsening the quality of life in terms of higher pain, fatigue, worsened sleep
      quality and higher incidence of mood disorders. Weight control is thus an
      effective tool to improve the symptoms. Moreover, it seems reasonable to
      eliminate some foods from the diet of FM patients, for example excitotoxins.
      Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is increasingly recognised as a frequent condition
      with similar manifestations which overlap with those of FM. The elimination of
      gluten from the diet of FM patients is recently becoming a potential dietary
      intervention for clinical improvement. In summary, this review reveals the
      potential benefit of specific dietary interventions as non-pharmacological tools 
      as part of a multidisciplinary treatment for FM patients.

      diseases.

AB  - Inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of many chronic diseases, such as
      rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have
      evidenced important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of omega-3 
      long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs). This review illustrates
      current knowledge about the efficacy of n-3 LC-PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
      and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), particularly) in preventing and/or treating
      several chronic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel diseases and
      rheumatoid arthritis) as well as their potential benefits on neurodegenerative
      diseases. It is well established that n-3 LC-PUFAs are substrates for synthesis
      of novel series of lipid mediators (e.g., resolvins, protectins, and maresins)
      with potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties, which have been
      proposed to partly mediate the protective and beneficial actions of n-3 LC-PUFAs.
      Here, we briefly summarize current knowledge from preclinical studies analyzing
      the actions of EPA- and DHA-derived resolvins and protectins on
      pathophysiological models of rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

TI  - Role of FODMAPs in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 665-82
LID - 10.1177/0884533615569886 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition characterized by abdominal pain,
      bloating, flatus, and altered bowel habits. The role of dietary components in
      inducing IBS symptoms is difficult to explore. To date, foods are not considered 
      a cause but rather symptom-triggering factors. Particular interest has been given
      to the so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and
      polyols). We aimed to summarize the evidence from the most common approaches to
      manage suspected food intolerance in IBS, with a particular interest in the role 
      of FODMAPs and the effects of a low FODMAP diet. We reviewed literature,
      consulting PubMed and Medline by using the search terms FODMAP(s), fructose,
      lactose, fructans, galactans, polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol,
      erythritol, polydextrose, and isomalt), irritable bowel syndrome, and functional 
      gastrointestinal symptoms. FODMAP-restricted diets have been used for a long time
      to manage patients with IBS. The innovation in the so-called FODMAP concept is
      that a global restriction should have a more consistent effect than a limited one
      in preventing abdominal distension. Even though all the potential low FODMAP
      diets provide good relief of symptoms in many patients, there is just a little
      relief in others. Several studies highlight the role of low FODMAP diets to
      improve symptoms in patients with IBS. The evidence on this dietary approach
      supports the hypothesis that a low FODMAP diet should be the first dietary
      approach. However, many points remain to be clarified, including the evaluation
      of possibly significant nutrition concerns.

TI  - The rise and fall of gluten!
PG  - 221-6
LID - 10.1017/S0029665115000038 [doi]
AB  - Mankind has existed for 2.5 million years but only in the last 10,000 years have 
      we been exposed to wheat. Wheat was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent
      (South Western Asia) with a farming expansion that lasted from about 9000BC to
      4000BC. Thus it could be considered that wheat (and gluten) is a novel
      introduction to man's diet! Prior to 1939 the rationing system had already been
      devised. This led to an imperative to try to increase agricultural production.
      Thus it was agreed in 1941 that there was a need to establish a Nutrition
      Society. The very roots of the society were geared towards necessarily increasing
      the production of wheat. This goal was achieved and by the end of the 20th
      century, global wheat output had expanded 5-fold. Perhaps as a result the
      epidemiology of coeliac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy has changed.
      CD is a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in
      genetically susceptible individuals. CD now affects 1 % or more of all adults,
      for which the treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, there is 
      a growing body of evidence to show that a far greater proportion of individuals
      without coeliac disease are taking a gluten-free diet of their own volition. This
      clinical entity has been termed non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although
      the condition is fraught with complexities due to overlap with other gluten-based
      constituents that can also trigger similar clinical symptoms. This review will
      explore the relationship between gluten, the rising prevalence of modern coeliac 
      disease, and the new entity of NCGS along with its associated uncertainties.

TI  - Nonpharmacologic treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 522-35
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-2123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Various nonpharmacologic treatments are available for
      pediatric abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (AP-FGIDs). Data on efficacy and safety are scarce. The goal of this study was to
      summarize the evidence regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric
      AP-FGIDs: lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, behavioral
      interventions, prebiotics and probiotics, and alternative medicine. METHODS:
      Searches were conducted of the Medline and Cochrane Library databases. Systematic
      reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning nonpharmacologic
      therapies in children (aged 3-18 years) with AP-FGIDs were included, and data
      were extracted on participants, interventions, and outcomes. The quality of
      evidence was assessed by using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs were
      found that included 1390 children. Significant improvement of abdominal pain was 
      reported after hypnotherapy compared with standard care/wait-list approaches and 
      after cognitive behavioral therapy compared with a variety of control
      treatments/wait-list approaches. Written self-disclosure improved pain frequency 
      at the 6-month follow-up only. Compared with placebo, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG 
      (LGG) and VSL#3 were associated with significantly more treatment responders (LGG
      relative risk: 1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.59]; VSL#3: P < .05).
      Guar gum significantly improved irritable bowel syndrome symptom frequency;
      however, no effect was found for other fiber supplements (relative risk: 1.17
      [95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.81]) or a lactose-free diet. Functional
      disability was not significantly decreased after yoga compared with a wait-list
      approach. No studies were found concerning lifestyle interventions; gluten-,
      histamine-, or carbonic acid-free diets; fluid intake; or prebiotics. No serious 
      adverse effects were reported. The quality of evidence was found to be very low
      to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Although high-quality studies are lacking, some
      evidence shows efficacy of hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
      probiotics (LGG and VSL#3) in pediatric AP-FGIDs. Data on fiber supplements are
      inconclusive.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena?
PG  - 278-87
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.427 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous functional disorder with a
      multifactorial etiology that involves the interplay of both host and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors relevant for IBS etiology, the
      diet stands out given that the majority of IBS patients report their symptoms to 
      be triggered by meals or specific foods. The diet provides substrates for
      microbial fermentation, and, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is
      disturbed in IBS patients, the link between diet, microbiota composition, and
      microbial fermentation products might have an essential role in IBS etiology. In 
      this review, we summarize current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the
      intestinal microbiota on IBS symptoms, as well as the reported interactions
      between diet and the microbiota composition. On the basis of the existing data,
      we suggest pathways (mechanisms) by which diet components, via the microbial
      fermentation, could trigger IBS symptoms. Finally, this review provides
      recommendations for future studies that would enable elucidation of the role of
      diet and microbiota and how these factors may be (inter)related in the
      pathophysiology of IBS.

TI  - Is tooth loss associated with irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 503-11
LID - 10.1111/joor.12277 [doi]
AB  - Although the relationship between number of teeth and gastric disturbances has
      been recognised, limited data are available linking tooth loss and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aimed to investigate the relation between dental
      status and IBS among Iranian adults. In a cross-sectional study on 4669 Iranian
      adults, dental status was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire.
      Participants were categorised into five main groups: those with full dentition
      (without denture), those with denture, individual who had lost 1-2 teeth, 3-5
      teeth and half of one jaw or more. IBS and its subtypes were defined using Rome
      III criteria. After adjusting for different confounding variables, those who had 
      lost 1-2 and 3-5 teeth had 1.35 and 1.33 times greater odds for IBS than fully
      dentate subjects, respectively. After controlling for different confounders,
      individuals who had denture had 103% greater odds to have
      constipation-predominant IBS than those with full dentition (95% confidence
      interval: 1.29-3.21). Neither in crude nor in adjusted models were any
      significant association between dental status and other subtypes of IBS. In
      addition, we did not find any association between losing half of one jaw or more 
      and IBS. We found that losing 1-2 or 3-5 teeth might significantly be associated 
      with increased risk of IBS. Having denture might be related to
      constipation-predominant IBS. There should be further prospective studies to
      confirm these findings.

TI  - Characteristics and factors related to quality of life in Mexican Mestizo
      patients with celiac disease.
PG  - 4

AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a global health problem and its prevalence is 
      underestimated, especially in Latin American populations. Our aim was to evaluate
      the clinical features, psychological factors, and health-related quality of life 
      (QoL), before and after diagnosis, in a representative sample of adult Mexican
      Mestizo patients presenting with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was
      conducted on patients seen at two tertiary referral centers in Mexico. QoL before
      and after CD diagnosis was evaluated using the EuroQoL 5D, the Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale (HADS), and the disease-specific Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 80 patients (80% were women, with a mean age
      of 48.6 +/- 14.1 years). The most common symptoms were diarrhea (86%), bloating
      (77.5%), and abdominal pain (71.3%). Mean symptom duration was 10.33 +/- 6.3
      years. Fifty-one patients (63.8%) had a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and 23 (28.8%) had one of functional dyspepsia. Questionnaire
      respondents rated their health status at 50% before diagnosis (0 = worst
      imaginable state, 100 = best imaginable state) and there was a significant
      improvement of 26% after diagnosis. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had a CSI
      score > 45 and they were the ones that had been previously diagnosed most often
      with IBS (p = 0.13) or dyspepsia (p = .036). CONCLUSIONS: At the time of
      diagnosis, Mexican Mestizo patients with CD had poor QoL. Long-standing symptoms 
      and a previous diagnosis of functional disorders were associated with worse QoL. 
      As in other populations, our results support the need for a detailed examination 
      of cost-effective strategies for increasing CD awareness in clinical practice.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of mesalazine in IBS.
PG  - 82-90
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-308188 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low-grade intestinal inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology 
      of IBS. In this trial, we aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      mesalazine in patients with IBS. DESIGN: We conducted a phase 3, multicentre,
      tertiary setting, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients 
      with Rome III confirmed IBS. Patients were randomly assigned to either
      mesalazine, 800 mg, or placebo, three times daily for 12 weeks, and were followed
      for additional 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was satisfactory relief of
      abdominal pain/discomfort for at least half of the weeks of the treatment period.
      The key secondary endpoint was satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms.
      Supportive analyses were also performed classifying as responders patients with a
      percentage of affirmative answers of at least 75% or >75% of time. RESULTS: A
      total of 185 patients with IBS were enrolled from 21 centres. For the primary
      endpoint, the responder patients were 68.6% in the mesalazine group versus 67.4% 
      in the placebo group (p=0.870; 95% CI -12.8 to 15.1). In explorative analyses,
      with the 75% rule or >75% rule, the percentage of responders was greater in the
      mesalazine group with a difference over placebo of 11.6% (p=0.115; 95% CI -2.7%
      to 26.0%) and 5.9% (p=0.404; 95% CI -7.8% to 19.4%), respectively, although these
      differences were not significant. For the key secondary endpoint, overall
      symptoms improved in the mesalazine group and reached a significant difference of
      15.1% versus placebo (p=0.032; 95% CI 1.5% to 28.7%) with the >75% rule.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine treatment was not superior than placebo on the study
      primary endpoint. However, a subgroup of patients with IBS showed a sustained
      therapy response and benefits from a mesalazine therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Crosstalk at the mucosal border: importance of the gut microenvironment in IBS.
PG  - 36-49
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2014.200 [doi]
AB  - The aetiology and pathology of IBS, a functional bowel disorder thought to lack
      an organic cause, is largely unknown. However, studies suggest that various
      features, such as altered composition of the gut microbiota, together with
      increased intestinal permeability, a changed balance in the enteroendocrine
      system and a dysregulated immune system in the gut, most likely have an important
      role in IBS. Exactly how these entities act together and give rise to symptoms is
      still unknown, but an altered gut microbiota composition could lead to
      dysregulation of the intestinal barrier as well as the enteroendocrine and the
      immune systems, which (through interactions with the nervous system) might
      generate symptoms. This Review highlights the crosstalk between the gut
      microbiota, the enteroendocrine system, the immune system and the role of
      intestinal permeability in patients with IBS.

LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000634 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A potential link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
      and abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGID) has
      been suggested by symptom similarities and by the reported prevalence of SIBO in 
      children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional AP. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the prevalence of SIBO using the glucose hydrogen breath
      test (GHBT), in a cohort of Dutch children with AP-FGID fulfilling the Rome III
      criteria, and to identify potential predictors. METHODS: Children ages 6 to 18
      years with AP-FGID fulfilling the Rome III criteria were included. All of the
      children underwent a GHBT. SIBO was diagnosed if the fasting breath hydrogen
      concentration was >/=20 ppm or an increase in H2 levels of >/=12 ppm above the
      baseline value was measured after ingestion of glucose. Gastrointestinal symptoms
      were collected using a standardised AP questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 161
      Dutch children with AP-FGID were enrolled. Twenty-three patients (14.3%) were
      diagnosed as having SIBO, as assessed by GHBT; 78% of the children diagnosed as
      having SIBO had fasting hydrogen levels >/=20 ppm. IBS was significantly more
      found in children with SIBO compared with children without SIBO (P = 0.001). An
      altered defecation pattern (ie, change in frequency or form of stool) (P =
      0.013), loss of appetite (P = 0.007), and belching (P = 0.023) were significantly
      more found in children with SIBO compared with those without SIBO. CONCLUSIONS:
      SIBO is present in 14.3% of children presenting with AP-FGID. IBS, altered
      defecation pattern, loss of appetite, and belching were predictors for SIBO in
      children with AP-FGID.

AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

TI  - Exploring the genetics of irritable bowel syndrome: a GWA study in the general
      population and replication in multinational case-control cohorts.
PG  - 1774-82

AB  - OBJECTIVE: IBS shows genetic predisposition, but adequately powered gene-hunting 
      efforts have been scarce so far. We sought to identify true IBS genetic risk
      factors by means of genome-wide association (GWA) and independent replication
      studies. DESIGN: We conducted a GWA study (GWAS) of IBS in a general population
      sample of 11,326 Swedish twins. IBS cases (N=534) and asymptomatic controls
      (N=4932) were identified based on questionnaire data. Suggestive association
      signals were followed-up in 3511 individuals from six case-control cohorts. We
      sought genotype-gene expression correlations through single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP)-expression quantitative trait loci interactions testing, and
      performed in silico prediction of gene function. We compared candidate gene
      expression by real-time qPCR in rectal mucosal biopsies of patients with IBS and 
      controls. RESULTS: One locus at 7p22.1, which includes the genes KDELR2 (KDEL
      endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2) and GRID2IP (glutamate
      receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 (Grid2) interacting protein), showed consistent IBS
      risk effects in the index GWAS and all replication cohorts and reached
      p=9.31x10(-6) in a meta-analysis of all datasets. Several SNPs in this region are
      associated with cis effects on KDELR2 expression, and a trend for increased
      mucosal KDLER2 mRNA expression was observed in IBS cases compared with controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that general population-based studies
      combined with analyses of patient cohorts provide good opportunities for gene
      discovery in IBS. The 7p22.1 and other risk signals detected in this study
      constitute a good starting platform for hypothesis testing in future functional
      investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric
      patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and organic
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched
      healthy sample across GI diagnostic groups and with one another. STUDY DESIGN:
      The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in
      a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114
      families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed
      workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS:
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the
      healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; 
      P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients
      with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease.
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days
      in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who 
      missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger
      effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or 
      organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children.
      HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical
      research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and
      organic GI diseases.

AB  - GOALS: To evaluate validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the Short Health 
      Scale (SHS) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. BACKGROUND: Subjective
      health assessment is central when treating patients with IBS. The "Short Health
      Scale" is a quick 4-item questionnaire covering most aspects of subjective health
      that has been validated for inflammatory bowel disease. STUDY: To test validity, 
      451 patients with IBS (mean age, 38 y; 81% females) completed the SHS and
      questionnaires assessing IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS), gastrointestinal
      (GI)-specific anxiety (VSI), and quality of life (IBSQOL). To evaluate
      reliability and responsiveness to changes, the questionnaires were repeated after
      2 weeks in 18 patients, and after 12 weeks in 212 patients who had completed a
      patient-education program. RESULTS: Validity was documented with (1) gradually
      increasing mean scores for all 4 SHS items with increasing IBS-SSS (P<0.0001),
      and (2) correlations between the 4 SHS items and the corresponding items from the
      other subjective health assessment tools [item 1 (symptom burden): rho=0.67, item
      2 (daily function): rho=-0.44 to -0.46, item 3 (disease-related worry): rho=-0.51
      to 0.57, item 4 (general well-being): rho=-0.34 to -0.46, P<0.0001]. Reliability 
      was confirmed (Spearman rho>0.7 and intraclass correlations >0.7). Responsiveness
      was good with responders to the patient-education program (IBS-SSS reduction
      >/=50 points) having significant reductions in 3 of the SHS items (P<0.05), and
      borderline change for the fourth SHS item (P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SHS is a health 
      measure that shows promising evidence of validity, reliability, and
      responsiveness in IBS patients. It is quickly completed and evaluated, which
      supports its usefulness in the busy clinical practice.

TI  - Dietary requirement for serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins in the clinical
      management of patients with enteropathy.
PG  - 13-23
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3322-0 [doi]
AB  - A variety of human disease conditions are associated with chronic intestinal
      disorders or enteropathies that are characterized by intestinal inflammation,
      increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Such
      disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to
      symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and
      malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in
      understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between 
      the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying
      immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during
      enteropathy are still not available. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
      ability of oral immunoglobulins to improve weight gain, support gut barrier
      function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animals. More recently,
      studies in humans provide evidence that serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin/protein isolate is safe and improves nutritional status and GI
      symptoms in patients with enteropathy associated with irritable bowel syndrome or
      infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. This review summarizes studies
      showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially
      formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and
      nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein
      preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary
      management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have
      limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs
      or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements
      that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.

TI  - Effect of dietary management on the gastric endocrine cells in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 519-24
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gastric endocrine cells in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) tend to normalize following dietary guidance. The aim of the
      present study was to identify the gastric endocrine cell types that are changed
      following such dietary guidance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fourteen IBS patients and 14
      healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of 
      individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the
      controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9
      months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were
      immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were
      quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin 
      cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were
      149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 
      +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the
      gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/-
      24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of
      serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4
      and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI
      18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the
      somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/-
      3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 
      22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell
      types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a 
      change in food intake.

TI  - Increased colonic bile acid exposure: a relevant factor for symptoms and
      treatment in IBS.
PG  - 84-92
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305965 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS. We investigated
      the potential effects of bile acids entering the colon and its role in the
      symptom pattern in IBS. DESIGN: We measured 75Se-labelled homocholic acid-taurine
      (75SeHCAT) retention, and serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4)
      and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 in patients with IBS (n=141) and control
      subjects (75SeHCAT n=29; C4 and FGF19 n=435). In patients with IBS stool
      frequency and form, as well as GI symptom severity were registered, and in a
      proportion of patients colonic transit time and rectal sensitivity were measured 
      (n=66). An 8-week open-label treatment with colestipol was offered to patients
      with 75SeHCAT <20%, and the effect of treatment was evaluated with IBS severity
      scoring system and adequate relief of IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with
      controls, patients with IBS had lower 75SeHCAT values (p=0.005), higher C4c
      levels (C4 corrected for cholesterol) (p<0.001), but similar FGF19 levels.
      Abnormal 75SeHCAT retention (<10%) was seen in 18% of patients, whereas 23% had
      elevated C4c levels. Patients with IBS with 75SeHCAT retention <10% had more
      frequent stools, accelerated colonic transit time, rectal hyposensitivity, a
      higher body mass index, higher C4c and lower FGF19 levels. Colestipol treatment
      improved IBS symptoms (IBS severity scoring system 220+/-109 vs. 277+/-106;
      p<0.01), and 15/27 patients fulfilled criteria for treatment response (adequate
      relief >/=50% of weeks 5-8). CONCLUSIONS: Increased colonic bile acid exposure
      influences bowel habit and colonic transit time in patients with IBS. A high
      response rate to open label treatment with colestipol supports this, but
      placebo-controlled studies are warranted.

TI  - Moderate to severe and prolonged left lower-abdominal pain is the best symptom
      characterizing symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon: a
      comparison with fecal calprotectin in clinical setting.
PG  - 218-21
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left lower-abdominal pain is considered the best symptom to
      differentiate between symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, this statement has not been validated
      yet. GOALS: The aim of this study was to assess whether prolonged left
      lower-quadrant pain is the best symptom characterizing SUDD and be able to
      differentiate SUDD from IBS-like symptoms in diverticulosis, and to compare the
      location of abdominal pain with fecal calprotectin (FC) expression. STUDY:
      Seventy-two patients suffering from abdominal pain and having diverticula at
      colonoscopy were enrolled. Patients were classified according to SUDD definition 
      (abdominal pain for at least 24 consecutive hours in left lower abdomen) (42
      patients) and IBS-like symptoms fulfilling Rome III criteria (30 patients).
      Abdominal pain was assessed using a 10-point visual scale, assigning numerical
      values from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (severe pain). FC expression was assessed
      by a rapid test in all patients enrolled. RESULTS: FC test was positive in 27
      (64.3%) patients in the SUDD group and in no patient in the IBS-like group
      (P<0.0001). In patients with SUDD, there was a significant correlation between
      the severity of the abdominal pain and the FC score (P=0.0015). Extension of
      diverticulosis correlated with FC score (P=0.022) and the severity of
      diverticulosis (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Severe and prolonged left lower-abdominal 
      pain seems to be the best symptom characterizing SUDD, and it can differentiate
      these patients from those harboring diverticula but suffering from IBS-like
      according to Rome III criteria.
