TI  - Randomised controlled trial of mesalazine in IBS.
PG  - 82-90
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-308188 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low-grade intestinal inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology 
      of IBS. In this trial, we aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      mesalazine in patients with IBS. DESIGN: We conducted a phase 3, multicentre,
      tertiary setting, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients 
      with Rome III confirmed IBS. Patients were randomly assigned to either
      mesalazine, 800 mg, or placebo, three times daily for 12 weeks, and were followed
      for additional 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was satisfactory relief of
      abdominal pain/discomfort for at least half of the weeks of the treatment period.
      The key secondary endpoint was satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms.
      Supportive analyses were also performed classifying as responders patients with a
      percentage of affirmative answers of at least 75% or >75% of time. RESULTS: A
      total of 185 patients with IBS were enrolled from 21 centres. For the primary
      endpoint, the responder patients were 68.6% in the mesalazine group versus 67.4% 
      in the placebo group (p=0.870; 95% CI -12.8 to 15.1). In explorative analyses,
      with the 75% rule or >75% rule, the percentage of responders was greater in the
      mesalazine group with a difference over placebo of 11.6% (p=0.115; 95% CI -2.7%
      to 26.0%) and 5.9% (p=0.404; 95% CI -7.8% to 19.4%), respectively, although these
      differences were not significant. For the key secondary endpoint, overall
      symptoms improved in the mesalazine group and reached a significant difference of
      15.1% versus placebo (p=0.032; 95% CI 1.5% to 28.7%) with the >75% rule.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine treatment was not superior than placebo on the study
      primary endpoint. However, a subgroup of patients with IBS showed a sustained
      therapy response and benefits from a mesalazine therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Relationship between fructose and lactose intakes and functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms in a sample of 50-year-old Cantabrians in New Zealand.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - AIMS: To examine the relationship between fructose and lactose consumption and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in 50-year-old adults residing in
      Canterbury, New Zealand. METHODS: The Canterbury Health Ageing and Life Course
      (CHALICE) study is a study of 50-year-old Cantabrians. A 4-day estimated food and
      beverage diary (FBD) was completed by 227 participants, 75.7% of those recruited.
      The Birmingham IBS symptom questionnaire was administered and individual
      participant scores were calculated for constipation, diarrhoea, pain score, and
      total symptom score. Associations between symptoms and the intake of fructose and
      lactose were examined using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Greater mean
      daily intakes of fructose (P=0.05) and lactose (P=0.04) were associated with a
      lower prevalence of IBS pain symptoms after adjusting for demographics and social
      economic status. However there was no evidence of an association with
      constipation, diarrhoea or total IBS score. CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show
      inverse relationships between fructose and lactose intakes and IBS pain symptoms,
      the use of cross-sectional data do not allow us to determine causality in these
      relationships. However it is possible that participants may have reduced their
      intake of fructose and lactose in response to IBS related pain. Follow up of this
      cohort would allow us to determine if this is the case. Future research could
      also investigate whether people with IBS could benefit from guidance from a
      dietitian around consumption of high lactose or fructose-containing foods.

TI  - Crosstalk at the mucosal border: importance of the gut microenvironment in IBS.
PG  - 36-49
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2014.200 [doi]
AB  - The aetiology and pathology of IBS, a functional bowel disorder thought to lack
      an organic cause, is largely unknown. However, studies suggest that various
      features, such as altered composition of the gut microbiota, together with
      increased intestinal permeability, a changed balance in the enteroendocrine
      system and a dysregulated immune system in the gut, most likely have an important
      role in IBS. Exactly how these entities act together and give rise to symptoms is
      still unknown, but an altered gut microbiota composition could lead to
      dysregulation of the intestinal barrier as well as the enteroendocrine and the
      immune systems, which (through interactions with the nervous system) might
      generate symptoms. This Review highlights the crosstalk between the gut
      microbiota, the enteroendocrine system, the immune system and the role of
      intestinal permeability in patients with IBS.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome is positively related to metabolic syndrome: a
      population-based cross-sectional study.
PG  - e112289
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0112289 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder that may affect
      dietary pattern, food digestion, and nutrient absorption. The nutrition-related
      factors are closely related to metabolic syndrome, implying that irritable bowel 
      syndrome may be a potential risk factor for metabolic syndrome. However, few
      epidemiological studies are available which are related to this potential link.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether irritable bowel syndrome is
      related to metabolic syndrome among middle-aged people. We designed a
      cross-sectional study of 1,096 subjects to evaluate the relationship between
      irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome and its components. Diagnosis of 
      irritable bowel syndrome was based on the Japanese version of the Rome III
      Questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria of the
      American Heart Association scientific statements of 2009. Dietary consumption was
      assessed via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Principal-components
      analysis was used to derive 3 major dietary patterns: "Japanese",
      "sweets-fruits", and "Izakaya (Japanese Pub) "from 39 food groups. The prevalence
      of irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome were 19.4% and 14.6%,
      respectively. No significant relationship was found between the dietary pattern
      factor score tertiles and irritable bowel syndrome. After adjustment for
      potential confounders (including dietary pattern), the odds ratio (95% confidence
      interval) of having metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides for subjects
      with irritable bowel syndrome as compared with non-irritable bowel syndrome are
      2.01(1.13-3.55) and 1.50(1.03-2.18), respectively. Irritable bowel syndrome is
      significantly related to metabolic syndrome and it components. This study is the 
      first to show that irritable bowel syndrome was significantly related to a higher
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides among an adult
      population. The findings suggest that the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome
      may be a potentially beneficial factor for the prevention of metabolic syndrome. 
      Further study is needed to clarify this association.

TI  - Blastocystis is associated with decrease of fecal microbiota protective bacteria:
      comparative analysis between patients with irritable bowel syndrome and control
      subjects.
PG  - e111868
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0111868 [doi]
AB  - Blastocystis is a protistan parasite living in the digestive tract of many
      animals, including humans. This highly prevalent intestinal parasite is suspected
      to be linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a chronic functional bowel
      disorder. Here, we first compared the prevalence of Blastocystis among 56 IBS
      patients (40 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 9 IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), 4 mixed 
      IBS (IBS-M) and 3 unsubtyped IBS (IBS-U) according to the Rome III criteria) and 
      56 control (i.e. without any diagnosed chronic or acute gastrointestinal
      disorder) subjects. The highest prevalence of Blastocystis spp. was observed in
      the IBS group, but was only statistically significant in men (36.8% in the IBS
      group versus 4.8% in the control group). We then conducted a meta-analysis
      including epidemiological studies attempting to determine whether Blastocystis
      carriage could be linked to IBS, and highlighted that IBS patients had a relative
      risk of 2.34 to be infected by Blastocystis when compared to non-IBS subjects. We
      also looked for Dientamoeba fragilis, which is often associated with IBS, and
      identified this parasite only in some IBS patients (n = 6/56). Several studies
      provided evidence for a major role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology
      of IBS. Thus, we investigated the possible impact of Blastocystis carriage on the
      enteric bacterial community through quantification of 8 major bacterial groups
      from the enteric flora. Our data indicated that men with IBS-C had a significant 
      decrease in Bifidobacterium sp. when infected by Blastocystis. Interestingly, in 
      control subjects (i.e. without any gastrointestinal disorder) positive for
      Blastocystis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is known for its
      anti-inflammatory properties, was significantly decreased in men. Our results
      support the hypothesis that Blastocystis might be linked to the pathophysiology
      of IBS-C and intestinal flora imbalance.

AB  - A variety of foods have been implicated in symptoms of patients with Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but wheat products are most frequently cited by patients as 
      a trigger. Our aim was to investigate the effects of breads, which were fermented
      for different lengths of time, on the colonic microbiota using in vitro batch
      culture experiments. A set of in vitro anaerobic culture systems were run over a 
      period of 24 h using faeces from 3 different IBS donors (Rome Criteria-mainly
      constipated) and 3 healthy donors. Changes in gut microbiota during a time course
      were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), whilst the
      small-molecular weight metabolomic profile was determined by NMR analysis. Gas
      production was separately investigated in non pH-controlled, 36 h batch culture
      experiments. Numbers of bifidobacteria were higher in healthy subjects compared
      to IBS donors. In addition, the healthy donors showed a significant increase in
      bifidobacteria (P<0.005) after 8 h of fermentation of a bread produced using a
      sourdough process (type C) compared to breads produced with commercial yeasted
      dough (type B) and no time fermentation (Chorleywood Breadmaking process) (type
      A). A significant decrease of delta-Proteobacteria and most Gemmatimonadetes
      species was observed after 24 h fermentation of type C bread in both IBS and
      healthy donors. In general, IBS donors showed higher rates of gas production
      compared to healthy donors. Rates of gas production for type A and conventional
      long fermentation (type B) breads were almost identical in IBS and healthy
      donors. Sourdough bread produced significantly lower cumulative gas after 15 h
      fermentation as compared to type A and B breads in IBS donors but not in the
      healthy controls. In conclusion, breads fermented by the traditional long
      fermentation and sourdough are less likely to lead to IBS symptoms compared to
      bread made using the Chorleywood Breadmaking Process.

TI  - The endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ-NOP receptor system as a potential
      therapeutic target for intestinal disorders.
PG  - 1519-26
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12460 [doi]
AB  - In 1995, by reverse pharmacology approach, used here for the first time in the
      history of pharmacology, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) has been discovered as
      the endogenous ligand of a preidentified receptor named opioid receptor like 1.
      Subsequent studies showed that N/OFQ and its receptor (N/OFQergic system) are
      widely distributed in central and peripheral nervous systems as well as in
      peripheral organs of human and animals, and represent a system that is involved
      in a very large range of biological functions such as pain perception, intestinal
      motility and secretion, immune modulation, stress. From the time of its discovery
      to now, a high number of NOP agonists and antagonists have been synthesized and
      tested in various pathologies. Nevertheless, none of the molecules targeting
      N/OFQergic system have currently succeeded in going through clinical trials
      concerning gut pathologies, indicating that further studies are required. The
      work from Dr. Fichna et al., published in the present issue of
      Neurogastroenterology and Motility, adds another brick in the wall of
      understanding the role of N/OFQergic system in IBS-D pathology by the
      pharmacological evaluation of a new NOP receptor agonist, SCH 221510, in animal
      models of intestinal alterations (diarrhea and visceral hyperalgesia).
      Interestingly, authors report clinical data confirming the involvement of
      N/OFQergic system in IBS-D patients and, consequently, suggest this system as a
      valuable therapeutic target for IBS-D pathology. This minireview aims to give a
      brief summary of experimental and clinical studies focusing on the N/OFQergic
      system as pharmacological target for the therapeutic treatment of intestinal
      pathologies such as IBS and IBD.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation are prevalent 
      and burdensome gastrointestinal disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of the evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and chronic
      idiopathic constipation has recently been performed. By far, the most convincing 
      evidence was for the use of probiotics in IBS, which reported that overall
      probiotics reduced the risk of symptom persistence by 21%. However, only a
      minority of the trials were at a low risk of bias, and some used small sample
      sizes. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to combine individual small trials to
      improve the power to detect the direction, size, and consistency of an effect,
      but it can do little to overcome the poor design of individual trials. Many
      debate the use of meta-analysis to combine data from different probiotic species,
      strains, or combinations. It is recommended that all future meta-analyses of
      probiotics, in any clinical setting, perform subgroup analysis on specific
      species/strains and specific combinations. It is hoped that the current
      meta-analysis will empower clinicians in making evidence-based decisions
      regarding whether probiotics should be recommended for IBS, which
      species/strain(s) to use, and for which symptoms.

TI  - The role of FODMAPs in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 605-9
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000116 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition affecting
      approximately 10-15% of Western populations. The Rome III criteria are applied to
      many studies to validate the diagnosis of IBS. The low fermentable oligo, di,
      monosaccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet has been the subject of many robust
      clinical trials and is now used as the primary dietary therapy internationally.
      This review examines the current evidence for the role of the low FODMAP diet in 
      IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Detailed commentary on original research involving FODMAPs 
      and IBS symptoms from 2013 to 2014 is provided. SUMMARY: The low FODMAP diet has 
      been shown to be an efficacious therapy for reduction of functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms seen in IBS. Recent publications provide randomized
      controlled trial and prospective observational evidence in support of the diet
      for symptom management. The low FODMAP diet appears to be superior to a
      gluten-free diet in people with self-reported nonceliac gluten sensitivity.
      Although the low FODMAP diet has not been shown to reduce the prebiotic effect in
      the colon, total colonic bacterial load was reduced. Further research
      investigating the potential health implications of both this and the nutritional 
      adequacy of the liberalized low FODMAP diet is required.

TI  - Exploring the genetics of irritable bowel syndrome: a GWA study in the general
      population and replication in multinational case-control cohorts.
PG  - 1774-82

AB  - OBJECTIVE: IBS shows genetic predisposition, but adequately powered gene-hunting 
      efforts have been scarce so far. We sought to identify true IBS genetic risk
      factors by means of genome-wide association (GWA) and independent replication
      studies. DESIGN: We conducted a GWA study (GWAS) of IBS in a general population
      sample of 11,326 Swedish twins. IBS cases (N=534) and asymptomatic controls
      (N=4932) were identified based on questionnaire data. Suggestive association
      signals were followed-up in 3511 individuals from six case-control cohorts. We
      sought genotype-gene expression correlations through single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP)-expression quantitative trait loci interactions testing, and
      performed in silico prediction of gene function. We compared candidate gene
      expression by real-time qPCR in rectal mucosal biopsies of patients with IBS and 
      controls. RESULTS: One locus at 7p22.1, which includes the genes KDELR2 (KDEL
      endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2) and GRID2IP (glutamate
      receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 (Grid2) interacting protein), showed consistent IBS
      risk effects in the index GWAS and all replication cohorts and reached
      p=9.31x10(-6) in a meta-analysis of all datasets. Several SNPs in this region are
      associated with cis effects on KDELR2 expression, and a trend for increased
      mucosal KDLER2 mRNA expression was observed in IBS cases compared with controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that general population-based studies
      combined with analyses of patient cohorts provide good opportunities for gene
      discovery in IBS. The 7p22.1 and other risk signals detected in this study
      constitute a good starting platform for hypothesis testing in future functional
      investigations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric
      patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and organic
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched
      healthy sample across GI diagnostic groups and with one another. STUDY DESIGN:
      The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in
      a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114
      families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed
      workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS:
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the
      healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; 
      P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients
      with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease.
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days
      in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who 
      missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger
      effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or 
      organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children.
      HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical
      research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and
      organic GI diseases.

AB  - A chronic continuous or intermittent gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, the
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), appears to be due to dysregulation of
      brain-gut-microbiota communication. Furthermore, the "microbiota" greatly impacts
      the bi-directional brain-gut axis communication. This article describes IBS in
      relation to similar diseases, presents the background to osteopathy, and proposes
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to manage IBS. In IBS, OMT focuses on
      the nervous and circulatory systems, spine, viscera, and thoracic and pelvic
      diaphragms in order to restore homeostatic balance, normalize autonomic activity 
      in the intestine, promote lymphatic flow, and address somatic dysfunction.
      Lymphatic and venous congestion are treated by the lymphatic pump techniques and 
      stimulation of Chapmans reflex points. A simple treatment plan designed to lessen
      chronic pain and inflammation in IBS is presented based on current evidence-based
      literature. Since food itself, food allergies, and intolerance could contribute
      to symptom onset or even cause IBS, this article also provides dietary
      modifications to consider for patients.

      enteropathy.
PG  - 11713-26
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11713 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for a multitude of digestive and immune
      functions which depend upon the balanced interaction of the intestinal
      microbiota, diet, gut barrier function, and mucosal immune response. Disruptions 
      in one or more of these factors can lead to intestinal disorders or enteropathies
      which are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability,
      and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Enteropathy is frequently associated
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, inflammatory bowel disease,
      autoimmune enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 
      where pathologic changes in the intestinal tract lead to abdominal discomfort,
      bloating, abnormal bowel function (e.g., diarrhea, urgency, constipation and
      malabsorption). Unfortunately, effective therapies for the management of
      enteropathy and restoring intestinal health are still not available. An
      accumulating body of preclinical studies has demonstrated that oral
      administration of plasma- or serum-derived protein concentrates containing high
      levels of immunoglobulins can improve weight, normalize gut barrier function, and
      reduce the severity of enteropathy in animal models. Recent studies in humans,
      using serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate, demonstrate that such 
      protein preparations are safe and improve symptoms, nutritional status, and
      various biomarkers associated with enteropathy. Benefits have been shown in
      patients with HIV infection or diarrhea-predominant IBS. This review summarizes
      preclinical and clinical studies with plasma/serum protein concentrates and
      describes the effects on host nutrition, intestinal function, and markers of
      intestinal inflammation. It supports the concept that immunoglobulin-containing
      protein preparations may offer a new strategy for restoring functional
      homeostasis in the intestinal tract of patients with enteropathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common diagnosis in
      gastroenterology. Its etiology is unknown and therapeutic options limited. Trials
      suggest probiotics may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to assess the
      symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v (L. plantarum 299 v) for
      the relief of abdominal pain in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome II criteria.
      METHODS: This study was conducted in a referral hospital. Trial participants were
      randomized to receive either two capsules of L. plantarum 299 v at a dosage of 5 
      x 10(9) cfu per capsule or placebo daily for 8 wk. Severity of abdominal pain was
      assessed using a visual analog scale at each visit and a quality-of-life IBS
      (QoL-IBS) questionnaire was also completed. RESULTS: There was no significant
      difference in abdominal pain relief between the study and placebo groups (P =
      0.800). There was also no difference in QoL- IBS scores between the groups (P =
      0.687). Both groups had a significant improvement in abdominal pain scores over
      the study period, from an average of 251.55 to 197.90 (P < 0.0001) indicating a
      large placebo effect. CONCLUSION: An 8-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299 v did
      not provide symptomatic relief, particularly of abdominal pain and bloating, in
      patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria.

      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 430-6
LID - 10.4161/gmic.29796 [doi]
AB  - The last ten years' wide progress in the gut microbiota phylogenetic and
      functional characterization has been made evidencing dysbiosis in several
      gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gut disease with high prevalence and
      negative impact on patient's quality of life characterized mainly by visceral
      pain and/or discomfort, representing a good paradigm of chronic gut
      hypersensitivity. The IBS features are strongly regulated by bidirectional
      gut-brain interactions and there is increasing evidence for the involvement of
      gut bacteria and/or their metabolites in these features, including visceral pain.
      Further, gut microbiota modulation by antibiotics or probiotics has been
      promising in IBS. Mechanistic data provided mainly by animal studies highlight
      that commensals or probiotics may exert a direct action through bacterial
      metabolites on sensitive nerve endings in the gut mucosa, or indirect pathways
      targeting the intestinal epithelial barrier, the mucosal and/or systemic immune
      activation, and subsequent neuronal sensitization and/or activation.

TI  - Electrocardiograms changes in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders
      on low dose amitriptyline.
PG  - 11321-5
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i32.11321 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To study the effects of low dose amitriptyline on cardiac conduction in
      children. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data obtained from a double-blind,
      randomized placebo-controlled trial, evaluating low dose amitriptyline in
      children with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, and
      irritable bowel syndrome according to the Rome II criteria. Children 8-17 years
      of age were recruited from the pediatric gastroenterology clinics of 6 tertiary
      care centers in the United States. The electrocardiograms (EKGs) done prior to
      initiation of amitrityline and 1 mo after initiation of amitriptyline were
      examined. The changes in cardiac conduction were evaluated in patients and
      controls. RESULTS: Thirty children were included in the study. There were 12
      patients, ages 9-17 years of both genders, in the amitriptyline treatment group
      and 18 patients, ages 9-17 years of both genders, in the placebo treatment group.
      None of the patients had any baseline EKG abnormality. Amitriptyline use was
      associated with an increase in heart rate (P = 0.024) and QTc interval (P =
      0.0107) as compared to pre-EKGs. Children in the placebo group were also noted to
      present a statistically significant increase in QTc interval (P = 0.0498). None
      of the patients developed borderline QTc prolongation or long-QT syndrome after
      they were started on amitriptyline. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that
      once patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have been screened for
      prolonged QTc interval on baseline EKG, they probably do not need a second EKG
      for reevaluation of cardiac conduction after starting low dose amitriptyline.

TI  - Dietary requirement for serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins in the clinical
      management of patients with enteropathy.
PG  - 13-23
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3322-0 [doi]
AB  - A variety of human disease conditions are associated with chronic intestinal
      disorders or enteropathies that are characterized by intestinal inflammation,
      increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Such
      disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to
      symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and
      malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in
      understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between 
      the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying
      immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during
      enteropathy are still not available. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
      ability of oral immunoglobulins to improve weight gain, support gut barrier
      function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animals. More recently,
      studies in humans provide evidence that serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin/protein isolate is safe and improves nutritional status and GI
      symptoms in patients with enteropathy associated with irritable bowel syndrome or
      infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. This review summarizes studies
      showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially
      formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and
      nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein
      preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary
      management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have
      limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs
      or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements
      that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.

      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 519-24
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gastric endocrine cells in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) tend to normalize following dietary guidance. The aim of the
      present study was to identify the gastric endocrine cell types that are changed
      following such dietary guidance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fourteen IBS patients and 14
      healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of 
      individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the
      controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9
      months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were
      immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were
      quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin 
      cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were
      149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 
      +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the
      gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/-
      24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of
      serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4
      and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI
      18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the
      somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/-
      3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 
      22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell
      types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a 
      change in food intake.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: contemporary nutrition management strategies.
PG  - 781-99
LID - 10.1177/0148607114545329 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a complex disorder whose pathophysiology involves
      alterations in the enteric microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, gut
      immune/barrier function, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation,
      neurotransmitters, stress response, psychological factors, and more. The
      importance of diet in the management of irritable bowel syndrome has taken center
      stage in recent times as the literature validates the relationship of certain
      foods with the provocation of symptoms. Likewise, a number of elimination dietary
      programs have been successful in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
      Knowledge of the dietary management strategies for irritable bowel syndrome will 
      help guide nutritionists and healthcare practitioners to deliver optimal
      outcomes. This tutorial reviews the nutrition management strategies for irritable
      bowel syndrome.

      syndrome.
PG  - 8821-36
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i27.8821 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an intestinal functional disorder with the
      highest prevalence in the industrialized world. The intestinal microbiota (IM)
      plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and is not merely a consequence of this
      disorder. Previous research efforts have not revealed unequivocal microbiological
      signatures of IBS, and the experimental results are contradictory. The
      experimental methodologies adopted to investigate the complex intestinal
      ecosystem drastically impact the quality and significance of the results.
      Therefore, to consider the methodological aspects of the research on IM in IBS,
      we reviewed 29 relevant original research articles identified through a PubMed
      search using three combinations of keywords: "irritable bowel syndrome +
      microflora", "irritable bowel syndrome + microbiota" and "irritable bowel
      syndrome + microbiome". For each study, we reviewed the quality and significance 
      of the scientific evidence obtained with respect to the experimental method
      adopted. The data obtained from each study were compared with all considered
      publications to identify potential inconsistencies and explain contradictory
      results. The analytical revision of the studies referenced in the present review 
      has contributed to the identification of microbial groups whose relative
      abundance significantly alters IBS, suggesting that these microbial groups could 
      be IM signatures for this syndrome. The identification of microbial biomarkers in
      the IM can be advantageous for the development of new diagnostic tools and novel 
      therapeutic strategies for the treatment of different subtypes of IBS.

TI  - Neuroplasticity and dysfunction after gastrointestinal inflammation.
PG  - 611-27
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2014.103 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is innervated by several distinct populations of
      neurons, whose cell bodies either reside within (intrinsic) or outside
      (extrinsic) the gastrointestinal wall. Normally, most individuals are unaware of 
      the continuous, complicated functions of these neurons. However, for patients
      with gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBD and IBS, altered gastrointestinal
      motility, discomfort and pain are common, debilitating symptoms. Although bouts
      of intestinal inflammation underlie the symptoms associated with IBD, increasing 
      preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that infection and inflammation are
      also key risk factors for the development of other gastrointestinal disorders.
      Notably, a strong correlation exists between prior exposure to gut infection and 
      symptom occurrence in IBS. This Review discusses the evidence for neuroplasticity
      (structural, synaptic or intrinsic changes that alter neuronal function)
      affecting gastrointestinal function. Such changes are evident during inflammation
      and, in many cases, long after healing of the damaged tissues, when the nervous
      system fails to reset back to normal. Neuroplasticity within distinct populations
      of neurons has a fundamental role in the aberrant motility, secretion and
      sensation associated with common clinical gastrointestinal disorders. To find
      appropriate therapeutic treatments for these disorders, the extent and time
      course of neuroplasticity must be fully appreciated.

PG  - 1593-609
LID - 10.1517/14712598.2014.937419 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Saccharomyces boulardii is a well-known probiotic worldwide, and
      there are numerous studies including experimental and clinical trials in children
      and adults by the use of S. boulardii. AREAS COVERED: The objective of the
      present report is to provide an update on the evidence for the efficacy of S.
      boulardii CNCM I-745 in different clinical conditions. Saccharomyces boulardii is
      one of the best-studied probiotics in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and is shown to
      be safe and to reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization by about 1
      day. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the recommended probiotics for AGE in
      children by European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).
      Saccharomyces boulardii is also a recommended probiotic for the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and a recent study showed promising results
      for the treatment of AAD in children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend
      the long-term use of S. boulardii in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
      Although some clinical studies showed positive effects of S. boulardii on
      inflammation, there is no clinical evidence that S. boulardii is useful in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Saccharomyces boulardii could be used in patients
      needing Helicobacter pylori eradication because the S. boulardii improves
      compliance, decreases the side effects and moderately increases the eradication
      rate. There are new promising results (improving feeding tolerance, shorten the
      course of hyperbilirubinemia), but we do still not recommend the routine use of
      S. boulardii in newborns. EXPERT OPINION: Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a
      good example for the statement that each probiotic needs to be taxonomically
      characterized and its efficacy and safety should be documented individually in
      different clinical settings.

TI  - Relapsing and refractory ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 419-26
LID - 10.1159/000358148 [doi]
AB  - Approximately half of the children with ulcerative colitis (UC) have refractory, 
      relapsing or steroid-dependent disease. UC in children is more extensive than in 
      adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive
      disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in 
      UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid
      dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every
      resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease
      activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment,
      infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose
      intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be
      ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization
      of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate
      dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors
      and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when
      indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to
      become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed
      before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when
      all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of
      refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and
      this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in
      this setup.

TI  - [Estimation of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with
      constipation and diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 307-10
AB  - UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common reason for
      gastroenterology consultations. The diverse in symptomatology of the disease
      comes from its rich etiopathogenesis. Recently studies talk about infectious
      etiology of IBS and because of that it is necessary to expand its diagnostics by 
      small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) test. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with
      constipation (IBS-C) and diarrhea (IBS-D) irritable bowel syndrome with regard to
      nutrition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 46 subjects (33 women and 13
      men) in average age of 44 years, which were divided into two groups: diarrhea and
      constipation IBS. All patients underwent hydrogen breath test studying bacterial 
      overgrowth in the small intestine. In addition, each person had fulfilled a
      feeding questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student's t-test, Pearson test.
      RESULTS: It has been shown that there is no statistical significances between the
      prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrheal IBS and constipation IBS and gender.
      Average value of increments of hydrogen in breath during the test was higher in
      IBS-C in comparison with IBS-D, which was the highest in the intestine bacterial 
      overgrowth in patients with IBS-C. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS showed that there is no
      relationship between the type and frequency of consumption of milk, meat, fruit
      and vegetables, sweets and coffee and the prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrhea 
      and constipation IBS. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of constipation or diarrhea
      irritable bowel syndrome is not related to gender. SIBO is more common in
      patients with IBS-C than in IBS-D group. There is no relationship between the
      type of food consumed and the amount of SIBO in people with IBS. Type of food
      intake do not affect the status of the intestinal flora of people with IBS.

TI  - Gender-related differences in irritable bowel syndrome: potential mechanisms of
      sex hormones.
PG  - 6725-43
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i22.6725 [doi]
AB  - According to epidemiological studies, twice as many women as men are affected by 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in western countries, suggesting a role for sex
      hormones in IBS pathophysiology. Despite growing evidence about the implications 
      of sex hormones in IBS symptom modulation, data on mechanisms by which they
      influence disease development are sparse. This review aims to determine the state
      of knowledge about the role of sex hormones in sensorimotor dysfunctions and to
      address the possible interplay of sex hormones with common risk factors
      associated with IBS. The scientific bibliography was searched using the following
      keywords: irritable bowel syndrome, sex, gender, ovarian hormone, estradiol,
      progesterone, testosterone, symptoms, pain, sensitivity, motility, permeability, 
      stress, immune system, brain activity, spinal, supraspinal, imaging. Ovarian
      hormones variations along the menstrual cycle affect sensorimotor
      gastrointestinal function in both healthy and IBS populations. They can modulate 
      pain processing by interacting with neuromodulator systems and the emotional
      system responsible for visceral pain perception. These hormones can also modulate
      the susceptibility to stress, which is a pivotal factor in IBS occurrence and
      symptom severity. For instance, estrogen-dependent hyper-responsiveness to stress
      can promote immune activation or impairments of gut barrier function. In
      conclusion, whereas it is important to keep in mind that ovarian hormones cannot 
      be considered as a causal factor of IBS, they arguably modulate IBS onset and
      symptomatology. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains
      limited and studies assessing the link between IBS symptoms and ovarian hormone
      levels are needed to improve our knowledge of the disease evolution with regard
      to gender. Further studies assessing the role of male hormones are also needed to
      understand fully the role of sex hormones in IBS. Finally, investigation of
      brain-gut interactions is critical to decipher how stress, ovarian hormones, and 
      female brain processing of pain can translate into gut dysfunctions.

TI  - Serotonergic reinforcement of intestinal barrier function is impaired in
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 392-402
LID - 10.1111/apt.12842 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal
      integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIMS: To
      assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on
      mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential
      differences between healthy controls and IBS patients. METHODS: Fifteen IBS
      patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind
      placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test
      and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after
      ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic
      metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: 5-HTP administration
      significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in
      both healthy controls (7.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P 
      = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 +/- 4.8 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs.
      placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger
      increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after
      administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by
      redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the
      barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly
      lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in
      occludin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT 
      metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was
      seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the
      presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier 
      function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients.

TI  - Small intestinal permeability is increased in diarrhoea predominant IBS, while
      alterations in gastroduodenal permeability in all IBS subtypes are largely
      attributable to confounders.
PG  - 288-97
LID - 10.1111/apt.12829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal permeability has been studied in small groups of IBS
      patients with contrasting findings. AIMS: To assess intestinal permeability at
      different sites of the GI tract in different subtypes of well-characterised IBS
      patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess potential confounding factors. 
      METHODS: IBS patients and HC underwent a multi-sugar test to assess site-specific
      intestinal permeability. Sucrose excretion and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in 0-5 h 
      urine indicated gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability, respectively.
      Sucralose/erythritol ratio in 0-24 h and 5-24 h urine indicated whole gut and
      colonic permeability, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to assess
      the association between IBS groups and intestinal permeability and to adjust for 
      age, sex, BMI, anxiety or depression, smoking, alcohol intake and use of
      medication. RESULTS: Ninety-one IBS patients, i.e. 37% IBS-D, 23% IBS-C, 33%
      IBS-M and 7% IBS-U and 94 HC were enrolled. Urinary sucrose excretion was
      significantly increased in the total IBS group [mumol, median (Q1;Q3): 5.26
      (1.82;11.03) vs. 2.44 (0.91;5.85), P < 0.05], as well as in IBS-C and IBS-D vs.
      HC. However, differences attenuated when adjusting for confounders. The
      lactulose/rhamnose ratio was increased in IBS-D vs. HC [0.023 (0.013;0.038) vs.
      0.014 (0.008;0.025), P < 0.05], which remained significant after adjustment for
      confounders. No difference was found in 0-24 and 5-24 h sucralose/erythritol
      ratio between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small intestinal permeability is increased in 
      patients with IBS-D compared to healthy controls, irrespective of confounding
      factors. Adjustment for confounders is necessary when studying intestinal
      permeability, especially in a heterogeneous disorder such as IBS.

TI  - Markers for visceral hypersensitivity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1104-11
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogenous disorder with
      visceral hypersensitivity as important hallmark. It is not known whether IBS
      patients with visceral hypersensitivity have different epidemiological and
      clinical characteristics compared with IBS patients without visceral
      hypersensitivity. Aim of our study was to compare in detail a large group of
      hyper- vs normosensitive IBS patients with respect to epidemiological and
      clinical characteristics. METHODS: IBS patients (Rome III criteria) have been
      recruited for a large-scale cohort study. All patients from this cohort who
      underwent a rectal barostat procedure were included and allocated based on those 
      with and without visceral hypersensitivity. Patient demographics, and symptoms
      were collected using questionnaires (GSRS, HADS, SF-36) and a 14-day symptom
      diary for IBS-related symptoms. A multivariate logistic regression model was used
      to identify risk markers for having visceral hypersensitivity. KEY RESULTS:
      Ninety-five normosensitive and 93 hypersensitive IBS patients participated in
      this study. Hypersensitive patients had significantly higher scores for GSRS
      abdominal pain (p < 0.05), indigestion, reflux and constipation syndrome (all p <
      0.01), and IBS symptom intensity, discomfort (both p < 0.05) and mean symptom
      composite score (p < 0.01). Age, female sex, and the use of SSRI medication were 
      significantly different between the normo- and the hypersensitive IBS patients.
      However, after adjustment for other risk markers, only increasing age was found
      to be significantly associated with lower odds for having hypersensitivity (OR
      0.97 [95% CI: 0.94; 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Apart from more severe
      symptomatology, hypersensitive IBS patients are characterized by significantly
      younger age compared with normosensitive IBS patients. The study has been
      registered in the US National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,
      NCT00702026).

TI  - IBS and FAPS in children: a comparison of psychological and clinical
      characteristics.
PG  - 493-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000452 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that different subcategories of childhood
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGIDs) are not
      separate clinical entities, but represent variable expressions of the same FGID. 
      The aim of the present study was to compare clinical and psychological
      characteristics of children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional
      abdominal pain (FAP), and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS). METHODS: A
      total of 259 children, ages 8 to 18 years, fulfilling Rome III criteria for IBS
      or FAPS were included in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of
      hypnotherapy. At inclusion, questionnaires assessed demographics, clinical
      features, abdominal pain frequency and intensity, depression and anxiety,
      somatization, health-related quality of life, pain beliefs, and coping
      strategies. RESULTS: No differences were found between children with IBS and
      those with FAPS with respect to the main outcomes: frequency and intensity of
      abdominal pain, symptoms of depression and anxiety, somatization, health-related 
      quality of life, pain beliefs, and coping strategies. A significantly higher
      percentage of patients with IBS had a positive family history for AP-FGIDs (56.8%
      vs 37.8%; P = 0.00). Characteristics of patients with IBS subtypes did not
      differ. Patients with FAP or FAPS differed only with respect to problem-focused
      coping strategy (2.21 +/- 0.61 vs 2.52 +/- 0.49; P = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS:
      Pediatric patients with IBS and those with FAPS have similar psychosocial
      profiles. These results may explain why treatment response of psychological
      therapies in these AP-FGIDs is similar. These results may indicate that pediatric
      IBS and FAPS are different expressions of 1 underlying functional disorder, but
      similarities in psychosocial characteristics do not exclude the possibility that 
      these disorders are different entities, because these similarities can exist
      between disorders of various causes. Therefore, future research is required on
      the role of other (physiological) factors in pediatric IBS and FAPS.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms module: feasibility, reliability, and validity.
PG  - 347-55
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the measurement
      properties of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for
      patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages
      between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL 
      Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682
      parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic
      constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease).
      RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood,
      diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales
      evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores
      (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and
      good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report
      alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with
      the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales 
      known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor
      analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS:
      The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement
      properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in
      clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs
      and organic GI diseases.

TI  - Practical approaches to probiotics use.
PG  - 980-6
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2013-0490 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are microorganisms exerting beneficial effects on the host. They can
      be ingested through foods or supplements and their inclusion in these products is
      regulated in Canada by the Health Canada Health Products and Food Branch. The aim
      of this article is to summarize current evidence from randomized controlled
      trials and guidelines from Health Canada, the World Health Organization, and
      internationally recognized expert committees in the hope that it will help
      practitioners and professionals recommending probiotics to healthy and diseased
      patients, with a focus on the Canadian setting. From a general perspective,
      probiotics can be recommended for prevention of diseases that are associated to
      altered intestinal ecology. Specifically, they can be recommended for prevention 
      of upper respiratory tract infections and pouchitis, for prevention and
      management of necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial vaginosis and antibiotic
      associated diarrhea, including Clostridium difficile infection, and for treatment
      of atopic eczema in cow's milk allergy and of infectious diarrhea. Additional
      substantiated probiotic benefits include prevention of hypercholesterolemia,
      management of constipation, reduction of recurrent urinary tract infections,
      improvement of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and reduction of antibiotics
      side effects in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Because probiotics are generally
      recognized as safe and can be removed with antimicrobial agents, their use should
      be considered in patients of all ages.

TI  - Effects in the use of a genetically engineered strain of Lactococcus lactis
      delivering in situ IL-10 as a therapy to treat low-grade colon inflammation.
PG  - 1611-21
LID - 10.4161/hv.28549 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now
      evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients,
      including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as 
      the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus
      lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many
      pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In
      this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in
      IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of
      DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a
      recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible
      Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin 
      levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as
      readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing
      evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight
      junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of
      recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L.
      lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects 
      in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters.
      Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a
      "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE
      system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at
      mucosal surfaces.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pediatric functional abdominal pain has been linked to
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in adulthood, but little is known
      about patient characteristics in childhood that increase the risk for FGID in
      young adulthood. We investigated the contribution of gastrointestinal symptoms,
      extraintestinal somatic symptoms, and depressive symptoms in pediatric patients
      with functional abdominal pain and whether these predicted FGIDs later in life.
      METHODS: In a longitudinal study, consecutive new pediatric patients, diagnosed
      with functional abdominal pain in a subspecialty clinic, completed a
      comprehensive baseline evaluation of the severity of their physical and emotional
      symptoms. They were contacted 5 to 15 years later and evaluated, based on Rome
      III symptom criteria, for abdominal pain-related FGIDs, including irritable bowel
      syndrome, functional dyspepsia, functional abdominal pain syndrome, and abdominal
      migraine. Controlling for age, sex, baseline severity of abdominal pain, and time
      to follow-up evaluation, multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate
      the association of baseline gastrointestinal, extraintestinal somatic, and
      depressive symptoms in childhood with FGID in adolescence and young adulthood.
      RESULTS: Of 392 patients interviewed an average of 9.2 years after their initial 
      evaluation, 41% (n = 162) met symptom criteria for FGID; most met the criteria
      for irritable bowel syndrome. Extraintestinal somatic and depressive symptoms at 
      the initial pediatric evaluation were significant predictors of FGID later in
      life, after controlling for initial levels of GI symptoms. Age, sex, and
      abdominal pain severity at initial presentation were not significant predictors
      of FGID later in life. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with functional
      abdominal pain, assessment of extraintestinal and depressive symptoms may be
      useful in identifying those at risk for FGID in adolescence and young adulthood.

TI  - Increased colonic bile acid exposure: a relevant factor for symptoms and
      treatment in IBS.
PG  - 84-92
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305965 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS. We investigated
      the potential effects of bile acids entering the colon and its role in the
      symptom pattern in IBS. DESIGN: We measured 75Se-labelled homocholic acid-taurine
      (75SeHCAT) retention, and serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4)
      and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 in patients with IBS (n=141) and control
      subjects (75SeHCAT n=29; C4 and FGF19 n=435). In patients with IBS stool
      frequency and form, as well as GI symptom severity were registered, and in a
      proportion of patients colonic transit time and rectal sensitivity were measured 
      (n=66). An 8-week open-label treatment with colestipol was offered to patients
      with 75SeHCAT <20%, and the effect of treatment was evaluated with IBS severity
      scoring system and adequate relief of IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with
      controls, patients with IBS had lower 75SeHCAT values (p=0.005), higher C4c
      levels (C4 corrected for cholesterol) (p<0.001), but similar FGF19 levels.
      Abnormal 75SeHCAT retention (<10%) was seen in 18% of patients, whereas 23% had
      elevated C4c levels. Patients with IBS with 75SeHCAT retention <10% had more
      frequent stools, accelerated colonic transit time, rectal hyposensitivity, a
      higher body mass index, higher C4c and lower FGF19 levels. Colestipol treatment
      improved IBS symptoms (IBS severity scoring system 220+/-109 vs. 277+/-106;
      p<0.01), and 15/27 patients fulfilled criteria for treatment response (adequate
      relief >/=50% of weeks 5-8). CONCLUSIONS: Increased colonic bile acid exposure
      influences bowel habit and colonic transit time in patients with IBS. A high
      response rate to open label treatment with colestipol supports this, but
      placebo-controlled studies are warranted.

TI  - Mucosa-associated Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli co-abundance 
      can distinguish Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosis requires
      comprehensive examination of the patient. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and
      Escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease (IBD) dysbiosis. The aim was to determine whether or not quantification
      of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or
      prognostic purposes. METHODS: Mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii and E. coli
      abundance was determined in 28 controls (H), 45 CD, 28 UC patients and 10
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
      (qPCR) and the F. prausnitzii-E. coli index (F-E index) was calculated. Species
      abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. Data was analyzed
      taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical
      characteristics. RESULTS: IBD patients had lower F. prausnitzii abundance than H 
      and IBS (P<0.001). CD patients showed higher E. coli counts than H and UC
      patients (P<0.001). The F-E index discriminated between H, CD and UC patients,
      and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as 
      ileal-CD (I-CD) from ileocolonic-CD and colonic-CD from extensive colitis. E.
      coli increased in active CD patients, and remission in I-CD patients was
      compromised by high abundance of this species. Treatment with anti-tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) alpha diminished E. coli abundance in I-CD whereas none of the
      treatments counterbalanced F. prausnitzii depletion. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii
      and E. coli are useful indicators to assist in IBD phenotype classification. The 
      abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in 
      I-CD patients. Our data indicates that current medication does not restore the
      levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.

PG  - 165-75
LID - 10.4161/gmic.27923 [doi]
AB  - We sought to determine whether a low fermentable substrate diet (LFSD) decreases 
      abdominal pain frequency in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to
      identify potential microbial factors related to diet efficacy. Pain symptoms,
      stooling characteristics, breath hydrogen and methane, whole intestinal transit
      time, stool microbiome, and metabolite composition were collected and/or
      documented in eight children with IBS at baseline and during one week of an LFSD 
      intervention. Pain frequency (P<0.05), pain severity (P<0.05), and pain-related
      interference with activities (P<0.05) decreased in the subjects while on the
      LFSD. Responders vs. non-responders: four children (50%) were identified as
      responders (> 50% decrease in abdominal pain frequency while on the LFSD). There 
      were no differences between responders and non-responders with respect to
      hydrogen production, methane production, stooling characteristics, or gut transit
      time. Responders were characterized by increased pre-LFSD abundance of bacterial 
      taxa belonging to the genera Sporobacter (P<0.05) and Subdoligranulum (P<0.02)
      and decreased abundance of taxa belonging to Bacteroides (P<0.05) relative to
      non-responders. In parallel, stool metabolites differed between responders and
      non-responders and were associated with differences in microbiome composition.
      These pilot study results suggest that an LFSD may be effective in decreasing GI 
      symptoms in children with IBS. Microbial factors such as gut microbiome
      composition and stool metabolites while on the diet may relate to LFSD efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: SCN5A encodes the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium
      channel NaV1.5. Many patients with cardiac arrhythmias caused by mutations in
      SCN5A also have symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated
      whether patients with IBS have SCN5A variants that affect the function of NaV1.5.
      METHODS: We performed genotype analysis of SCN5A in 584 persons with IBS and 1380
      without IBS (controls). Mutant forms of SCN5A were expressed in human embryonic
      kidney-293 cells, and functions were assessed by voltage clamp analysis. A
      genome-wide association study was analyzed for an association signal for the
      SCN5A gene, and replicated in 1745 patients in 4 independent cohorts of IBS
      patients and controls. RESULTS: Missense mutations were found in SCN5A in 13 of
      584 patients (2.2%, probands). Diarrhea-predominant IBS was the most prevalent
      form of IBS in the overall study population (25%). However, a greater percentage 
      of individuals with SCN5A mutations had constipation-predominant IBS (31%) than
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (10%; P < .05). Electrophysiologic analysis showed that 
      10 of 13 detected mutations disrupted NaV1.5 function (9 loss-of-function and 1
      gain-of-function function). The p. A997T-NaV1.5 had the greatest effect in
      reducing NaV1.5 function. Incubation of cells that expressed this variant with
      mexiletine restored their sodium current and administration of mexiletine to 1
      carrier of this mutation (who had constipation-predominant IBS) normalized their 
      bowel habits. In the genome-wide association study and 4 replicated studies, the 
      SCN5A locus was strongly associated with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: About 2% of patients
      with IBS carry mutations in SCN5A. Most of these are loss-of-function mutations
      that disrupt NaV1.5 channel function. These findings provide a new pathogenic
      mechanism for IBS and possible treatment options.

AB  - Alterations in the bidirectional interactions between the intestine and the
      nervous system have important roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). A body of largely preclinical evidence suggests that the gut
      microbiota can modulate these interactions. A small and poorly defined role for
      dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through
      characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported
      improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics,
      probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are 
      caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or 
      primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered
      interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the
      potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of
      patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal
      microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate
      intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder characterized by
      abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating. The pathophysiology of IBS is poorly
      understood, but the presence of psychosocial basis is now known. There is an
      increasing number of publications supporting the role of genetics in IBS. Most of
      the variations are found in genes associated with the brain-gut axis, revealing
      the strong correlation of brain-gut axis and IBS. miRNAs, which play critical
      roles in physiological processes, are not well studied in IBS. However, so far
      there is found an involvement of alterations in miRNA expression or sequence, in 
      IBS symptoms. IBS phenotype is affected by epigenetic alteration and environment.
      Changes in DNA and histone methylation are observed in patients who suffered
      childhood trauma or abuse, resulting in altered gene expression, such as the
      glucocorticoid receptor gene. Finally, diet is another factor associated with
      IBS, which may contribute to symptom onset. Certain foods may affect on bacterial
      metabolism and epigenetic modifications, predisposing to IBS.

TI  - Effect of Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum wheat on irritable bowel syndrome: a
      double-blinded randomised dietary intervention trial.
PG  - 1992-9
LID - 10.1017/S000711451400018X [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a replacement diet with
      organic, semi-whole-grain products derived from Triticum turgidum subsp.
      turanicum (ancient) wheat on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and
      inflammatory/biochemical parameters. A double-blinded randomised cross-over trial
      was performed using twenty participants (thirteen females and seven males, aged
      18-59 years) classified as having moderate IBS. Participants received products
      (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from ancient or modern wheat
      for 6 weeks in a random order. Symptoms due to IBS were evaluated using two
      questionnaires, which were compiled both at baseline and on a weekly basis during
      the intervention period. Blood analyses were carried out at the beginning and end
      of each respective intervention period. During the intervention period with
      ancient wheat products, patients experienced a significant decrease in the
      severity of IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P=
      0.004), satisfaction with stool consistency (P< 0.001) and tiredness (P< 0.0001).
      No significant difference was observed after the intervention period with modern 
      wheat products. Similarly, patients reported significant amelioration in the
      severity of gastrointestinal symptoms only after the ancient wheat intervention
      period, as measured by the intensity of pain (P= 0.001), the frequency of pain
      (P< 0.0001), bloating (P< 0.0001), abdominal distension (P< 0.001) and the
      quality of life (P< 0.0001). Interestingly, the inflammatory profile showed a
      significant reduction in the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
      including IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and
      vascular endothelial growth factor after the intervention period with ancient
      wheat products, but not after the control period. In conclusion, significant
      improvements in both IBS symptoms and the inflammatory profile were reported
      after the ingestion of ancient wheat products.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pharmacologic treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      and medical management of symptoms are increasingly based on IBS subtype, so it
      is important to accurately differentiate patients. Few studies have classified
      subtypes of pediatric IBS, and conclusions have been challenged by methodologic
      limitations. We performed a prospective study to investigate the distribution of 
      IBS subtypes among children and adolescents based on stool diary information, and
      compared subtypes according to demographic and pain characteristics. METHODS: We 
      studied 129 subjects, ages 7 to 18 years (mean age, 11.4 +/- 2.8 y; 60.5% female;
      69.0% white) who met Pediatric Rome III IBS criteria and were part of larger
      studies of children with functional gastrointestinal disorders, recruited from
      primary and tertiary care centers. Children completed daily pain and stool
      diaries for 2 weeks. Participants were assigned IBS subtypes based on their
      reported stool information per adult Rome III criteria. IBS subtypes were
      compared for demographic variables and pain characteristics. RESULTS: IBS with
      constipation was the most common subtype of the disorder (58.1% of subjects),
      whereas mixed IBS was the least common (2.3% of subjects); 34.1% of subjects were
      unsubtyped IBS and 5.4% had IBS with diarrhea. The groups of different IBS
      subtypes did not differ significantly by sex, age, ethnicity, or pain
      characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to adults, in children, IBS with
      constipation and unsubtyped IBS are the most common subtypes, whereas IBS with
      diarrhea and mixed IBS are less common. Demographic and pain characteristics
      cannot distinguish subtypes.

AB  - Evidence suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are more
      vigilant to pain-associated stimuli. The aims of this study were to compare women
      with IBS (n = 20) to healthy control (HC, n = 20) women on pain sensitivity,
      conditioned pain modulation (CPM) efficiency, and salivary cortisol levels before
      and after the CPM test and to examine the relationship of CPM efficiency with
      gastrointestinal pain, somatic pain, psychological distress symptoms, and
      salivary cortisol levels in each group. Women, aged 20-42 years, gave consent,
      completed questionnaires, and kept a symptom diary for 2 weeks. CPM efficiency
      was tested with a heat test stimulus and cold water condition stimulus in a
      laboratory between 8 and 10 a.m. on a follicular phase day. Salivary cortisol
      samples were collected just before and after the experimental testing. Compared
      to the HC group, women with IBS reported more days with gastrointestinal and
      somatic pain/discomfort, psychological distress, fatigue, and feeling stressed.
      During the CPM baseline testing, women with IBS reported greater pain sensitivity
      compared to the HC group. There was no significant group difference in salivary
      cortisol levels nor in CPM efficiency, though a post-hoc analysis showed a higher
      prevalence of impaired CPM efficiency among IBS subjects with more severe
      lower-GI symptoms. In the IBS group, reduced CPM efficiency was associated with
      daily abdominal pain/discomfort and psychological distress. Overall, women with
      IBS exhibited an increased sensitivity to thermal stimuli. Impaired CPM was
      present in a subset of women with IBS.

TI  - Mechanisms and efficacy of dietary FODMAP restriction in IBS.
PG  - 256-66
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2013.259 [doi]
AB  - IBS is a debilitating condition that markedly affects quality of life. The
      chronic nature, high prevalence and associated comorbidities contribute to the
      considerable economic burden of IBS. The pathophysiology of IBS is not completely
      understood and evidence to guide management is variable. Interest in dietary
      intervention continues to grow rapidly. Ileostomy and MRI studies have
      demonstrated that some fermentable carbohydrates increase ileal luminal water
      content and breath hydrogen testing studies have demonstrated that some
      carbohydrates also increase colonic hydrogen production. The effects of
      fermentable carbohydrates on gastrointestinal symptoms have also been well
      described in blinded, controlled trials. Dietary restriction of fermentable
      carbohydrates (popularly termed the 'low FODMAP diet') has received considerable 
      attention. An emerging body of research now demonstrates the efficacy of
      fermentable carbohydrate restriction in IBS; however, limitations still exist
      with this approach owing to a limited number of randomized trials, in part due to
      the fundamental difficulty of placebo control in dietary trials. Evidence also
      indicates that the diet can influence the gut microbiota and nutrient intake.
      Fermentable carbohydrate restriction in people with IBS is promising, but the
      effects on gastrointestinal health require further investigation.

      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1467-76
LID - 10.1007/s00535-013-0919-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and immune measures
      are present in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but the
      relationship to symptoms is poorly defined. In adults with IBS, we compared
      permeability, unstimulated peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC) interleukin-10
      (IL-10) levels, IBS life interference, and GI and psychological distress
      symptoms. METHODS: In 88 women and 18 men with IBS, GI permeability was
      quantitated as percent recovery of urinary sucrose and the lactulose/mannitol
      (L/M) ratio. IL-10 was measured in supernatants from 72-h incubated, unstimulated
      PBMCs. Participants completed a 4-week daily diary recording IBS life
      interference on daily activities and work, IBS symptoms, and psychological
      distress symptoms. They also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: The 
      L/M ratio but not percent sucrose recovery was significantly correlated with IBS 
      interference with activities and work and retrospectively measured anxiety and
      depression. Unstimulated PBMC production of IL-10 correlated significantly with
      IBS interference with daily work, IBS symptom score, and abdominal pain. We
      identified a subgroup of IBS subjects with higher IL-10 and/or higher L/M ratio
      who had substantially higher IBS interference and IBS symptom scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a distinct subgroup of IBS patients with
      alterations in gut barrier function. This subgroup is characterized by increased 
      GI permeability and/or increased PBMC production of IL-10. These physiologic
      alterations reflect more severe IBS as measured by interference of IBS with daily
      activities and daily IBS symptoms.

PG  - 74-86
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1361825 [doi]
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract inhabits a complex microbial ecosystem that
      plays a vital role in host health through its contributions to nutrient synthesis
      and digestion, protection from pathogens, and promoting maturation of host innate
      and adapt immune systems. The development of gut microbiota primarily occurs
      during infancy and is influenced by multiple factors, including prenatal
      exposure; gestational age; mode of delivery; feeding type; pre-, pro-, and
      antibiotic use; and host genetics. In genetically susceptible individuals,
      changes in the gut microbiota induced by environmental factors may contribute to 
      the development of immune-related disorders in childhood, including atopic
      diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Pre- and probiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment 
      of some immune-related diseases by modulating gut microbiota and regulating host 
      mucosal immune function. The review will discuss recent findings on the
      environmental factors that influence development of gut microbiota during infancy
      and its potential impact on some immune-related diseases in childhood. The use of
      pre- and probiotics for prevention and intervention of several important diseases
      in early life will also be reviewed.

TI  - Extra-intestinal and long term consequences of Giardia duodenalis infections.
PG  - 8974-85
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i47.8974 [doi]
AB  - Giardiasis is the most common waterborne parasitic infection of the human
      intestine worldwide. The etiological agent, Giardia duodenalis (syn. G.
      intestinalis, G. lamblia), is a flagellated, binucleated protozoan parasite which
      infects a wide array of mammalian hosts. Human giardiasis is a true cosmopolitan 
      pathogen, with highest prevalence in developing countries. Giardiasis can present
      with a broad range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, to acute or
      chronic diarrheal disease associated with abdominal pain and nausea. Most
      infections are self-limiting, although re-infection and chronic infection can
      occur. Recent evidence indicating that Giardia may cause chronic post-infectious 
      gastrointestinal complications have made it a topic of intense research. The
      causes of the post-infectious clinical manifestations due to Giardia, even after 
      complete elimination of the parasite, remain obscure. This review offers a
      state-of-the-art discussion on the long-term consequences of Giardia infections, 
      from extra-intestinal manifestations, growth and cognitive deficiencies, to
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. The discussion also sheds light on some
      of the novel mechanisms recently implicated in the production of these
      post-infectious manifestations.

TI  - Dietary fructose intolerance, fructan intolerance and FODMAPs.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1007/s11894-013-0370-0 [doi]
AB  - Dietary intolerances to fructose, fructans and FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) are common, yet
      poorly recognized and managed. Over the last decade, they have come to the
      forefront because of new knowledge on the mechanisms and treatment of these
      conditions. Patients with these problems often present with unexplained bloating,
      belching, distension, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Here, we have examined
      the most up-to-date research on these food-related intolerances, discussed
      controversies, and have provided some guidelines for the dietary management of
      these conditions. Breath testing for carbohydrate intolerance appears to be
      standardized and essential for the diagnosis and management of these conditions, 
      especially in the Western population. While current research shows that the
      FODMAP diet may be effective in treating some patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome, additional research is needed to identify more foods items that are
      high in FODMAPs, and to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dietary
      interventions.

TI  - The multiple roles of guanylate cyclase C, a heat stable enterotoxin receptor.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000020 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) is a transmembrane receptor that is
      expressed primarily on intestinal epithelial cells. Activation of this receptor
      by its endogenous peptide ligands initiates cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate-dependent (cGMP) salt and water movement in the intestine. GC-C is 
      targeted by the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin STa,
      which deregulates this pathway and causes secretory diarrhea. This review
      discusses current work on the physiological function of GC-C in the intestine.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Familial GC-C mutations demonstrate that epithelial cGMP
      signaling is critical to electrolyte and fluid balance in the neonatal intestine.
      Chronic deregulation of GC-C activity in early life increases susceptibility to a
      number of disorders, including obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease. Murine
      models indicate that GC-C regulates the composition of intestinal commensal
      microflora and that it suppresses bacterial infection and modulates colonic
      injury and inflammation. Therapeutic GC-C ligands are used to successfully treat 
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and recent studies show that
      extracellular cGMP is an important mechanism of reducing abdominal pain
      associated with this disorder. SUMMARY: Originally identified as a target of E.
      coli enterotoxin STa, GC-C is an important regulator of physiological salt and
      water homeostasis and may directly impact a wide range of intestinal disorders.

AB  - Gut microbiota is the community of live microorganisms residing in the digestive 
      tract. There are many groups of researchers worldwide that are working at
      deciphering the collective genome of the human microbiota. Modern techniques for 
      studying the microbiota have made us aware of an important number of
      nonculturable bacteria and of the relation between the microorganisms that live
      inside us and our homeostasis. The microbiota is essential for correct body
      growth, the development of immunity, and nutrition. Certain epidemics affecting
      humanity such as asthma and obesity may possibly be explained, at least
      partially, by alterations in the microbiota. Dysbiosis has been associated with a
      series of gastrointestinal disorders that include non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The present article deals 
      with the nomenclature, modern study techniques, and functions of gut microbiota, 
      and its relation to health and disease.

TI  - Functional digestive symptoms and quality of life in patients with Ehlers-Danlos 
      syndromes: results of a national cohort study on 134 patients.
PG  - e80321
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0080321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous
      group of heritable connective tissue disorders. Gastrointestinal manifestations
      in EDS have been described but their frequency, nature and impact are poorly
      known. We aimed to assess digestive features in a national cohort of EDS
      patients. METHODS: A questionnaire has been sent to 212 EDS patients through the 
      French patient support group, all of which had been formally diagnosed according 
      to the Villefranche criteria. The questionnaire included questions about
      digestive functional symptoms, the GIQLI (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life
      Index), KESS scoring system and the Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 135
      patients (64% response rate) completed the questionnaire and 134 were analyzable 
      (123 women; 91%). Mean age and Body Mass Index were respectively 35+/-14.7 years 
      and 24.3+/-6.1 kg/m(2). The most common EDS subtype was hypermobility form
      (n=108; 80.6%). GIQLI and KESS median values were respectively 63.5 (27-117) and 
      19 [13.5-22]. Eighty four percent of patients had functional bowel disorders
      (FBD) according to the Rome III criteria. An irritable bowel syndrome according
      to the same criteria was observed in 64 patients (48%) and 48 patients (36%)
      reported functional constipation. A gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) was
      reported in 90 patients (68.7%), significantly associated with a poorer GIQLI
      (60.5+/-16.8 versus 75.9+/-20.3; p<0.0001). GIQLI was also negatively impacted by
      the presence of an irritable bowel syndrome or functional constipation (p=0.007).
      There was a significant correlation between FBD and GERD. CONCLUSIONS: Natural
      frequency of gastrointestinal manifestations in EDS seems higher than previously 
      assessed. FBD and GERD are very common in our study population, the largest ever 
      published until now. Their impact is herein shown to be important. A systematic
      clinical assessment of digestive features should be recommended in EDS.

TI  - Role of FODMAP content in enteral nutrition-associated diarrhea.
PG  - 25-8
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12272 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea are common complications of enteral 
      nutrition (EN); however, the cause is unclear. Mode of EN delivery that alters
      digestion and possibly absorption is suggested to contribute to the high
      incidence of diarrhea; however, enteral formula is frequently blamed. Most
      research has focused on fiber-supplemented EN, with a meta-analysis showing that 
      fiber reduces the incidence of diarrhea in non-intensive care unit studies. Other
      hypotheses include formula osmolality and FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) content. FODMAPs are poorly absorbed
      short-chain carbohydrates that exert an osmotic effect. Dietary FODMAPs have been
      shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, in those with
      irritable bowel syndrome and, given a high-enough dose, will induce a laxative
      effect in most people. As FODMAPs are commonly added to enteral formula and EN is
      frequently used as the main source of nutrition, it is reasonable to hypothesize 
      that EN provides more FODMAPs than usual dietary intake and increases risk for
      developing diarrhea. This hypothesis was assessed through a retrospective study
      showing that the standard-use enteral formula Isosource 1.5 had a protective
      effect of developing diarrhea. The only characteristic unique to Isosource 1.5
      was the lower FODMAP content as determined through methodologies previously
      validated for food analysis. Methodologies for application to enteral formulas
      are currently undergoing formal validation. Once confirmed for application in
      enteral formula, future directions include FODMAP analysis of specific
      ingredients to increase understanding of potential problems associated with
      enteral formula and a randomized, controlled trial investigating the role of
      formula FODMAP content.

TI  - Faecal incontinence in rural and regional northern Queensland community-dwelling 
      adults.
PG  - 2563
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of liquid
      or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been reported in 8% of
      the South Australian and 11% of the urban New South Wales community-dwelling
      populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005 reported faecal incontinence in
      more than 20% of colorectal and urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville
      Hospital (a referral centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted
      concern regarding the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North 
      and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities. METHODS: The sample size
      was based on the New South Wales postal surveys (11% prevalence). Higher rates
      were expected in North/Far North Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at
      12.1% (confidence interval +/- 2%, ie the true level to be between 10.1% and
      14.1%). The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland)
      and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the present
      study was compiled using a systematic randomised process selecting two private
      names from each column on each page of the Cairns and Townsville White Pages(R)
      (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226 remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural,
      320 remote). The questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk
      factors, bowel habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. 
      Faecal incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool in
      the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or contaminated
      food. To improve the response rate a participation incentive of a chance to win a
      $250 voucher or one of ten $50 vouchers was offered in the initial mail-out. The 
      initial survey was mailed out in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out
      to non-responders in September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly
      selected non-responders were telephoned in February 2008. RESULTS: A total of
      1523 responses provided a 48.1% response rate. Faecal incontinence prevalence was
      12.7% (174/1366) with no gender or locality differences. Prevalence increased
      significantly with age in men (p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents
      with faecal incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this
      reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical conditions
      including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, injury
      to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease, neurological disease and
      psychiatric problems (all, p< 0.05). Stool-related accidental bowel leakage
      including faecal incontinence (defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was
      18.2%. An additional 3% were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of
      mucus, bothersome or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2%
      reported incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9% could not always
      differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2% reported neither concerns 
      with nor accidental bowel leakage. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of
      untreated faecal incontinence in North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand
      for treatment will increase because of the ageing population and the expectations
      of younger, more assertive cohorts.

AB  - This study was aimed at combining the highest degradation of gluten during wheat 
      flour fermentation with good structural and sensory features of the related
      bread. As estimated by R5-ELISA, the degree of degradation of immune reactive
      gluten was ca. 28%. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and RP-FPLC analyses showed
      marked variations of the protein fractions compared to the untreated flour. The
      comparison was also extended to in vitro effect of the peptic/tryptic-digests
      towards K562 and T84 cells. The flour with the intermediate content of gluten
      (ICG) was used for bread making, and compared to whole gluten (WG) bread. The
      chemical, structural and sensory features of the ICG bread approached those of
      the bread made with WG flour. The protein digestibility of the ICG bread was
      higher than that from WG flour. Also the nutritional quality, as estimated by
      different indexes, was the highest for ICG bread.

TI  - The gendered impact of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a qualitative study of patients'
      experiences.
PG  - 1334-43
LID - 10.1111/jan.12294 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the impact of irritable bowel syndrome
      on daily life from a gender perspective. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is 
      a common functional disorder, characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or
      constipation. Sufferers experience negative emotions due to unpredictable
      symptoms and sometimes feel trivialized by healthcare professionals. The
      sufferers' experience of living with this disorder has never been explored from a
      gender perspective. DESIGN: A qualitative, interpretative method was used.
      METHODS: A qualitative, hermeneutic method was applied. Interviews were conducted
      with 19 patients in 2011 and analysed in a constructionist gender framework.
      Constructionist gender theory views gender and identity as cultural constructs
      that develop through interplay between the individual and his/her social context 
      and cultural norms. FINDINGS: The main theme to emerge from the interviews was as
      follows: 'A normative framework of femaleness and maleness leads to suffering for
      persons with irritable bowel syndrome'. This consists of three interwoven themes:
      'Being forced to abandon gender illusions'; 'Being forced to transcend taboos'
      and 'Reinforced suffering in healthcare encounters'. Men demonstrated masculinity
      by stressing the importance of being solid family providers while women spoke of 
      nurturing and relational responsibilities in line with traditional notions of
      femininity. CONCLUSION: The experience of living with irritable bowel syndrome
      differs between men and women due to differing societal expectations, life
      situation and the everyday construction of gender identities. Gender stereotyping
      by healthcare professionals perpetuates rather than alleviates the suffering
      experienced by men and women with irritable bowel syndrome. In healthcare
      encounters, women risk being trivialized and men risk being overlooked due to the
      'female health concern' label attached to irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Role of PHGG as a dietary fiber: a review article.
PG  - 329-40
AB  - AIM: Functional and metabolic effects of dietary fiber are recognized by the
      scientific, clinical and nutritional experts. Dietary fiber plays a very
      significant role in modifying the intestinal microbiota, exerting prebiotic
      effects such as stimulating the growth and/or function of beneficial intestinal
      microorganisms. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically
      considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either
      inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular
      food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials
      with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients
      with such disorders. Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum (PHGG) is a natural dietary
      fiber (Benefibra, Novartis CH Italy): it is a white powder, water-soluble,
      colorless and transparent in water solution and almost tasteless. PHGG is stable 
      and soluble at various pH levels commonly found in foods as well as resistant to 
      heat, acid, salt, high pressure and digestive enzymes. Low viscosity of PHGG
      provides a distinct advantage for the use of fiber in enteral feeding products to
      be administered through feeding tubes. It has been studied in adults, both
      healthy volunteers and patients, in different disorders such as constipation,
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), enteral nutrition, small intestine bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) and, very recently, in children suffering from functional
      abdominal pain according to the Rome III Criteria definition for functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This review takes stock of the situation
      concerning what is known to date on PHGG as dietary fiber, in order to give the
      health care professionals, such as gastroenterologists, dieticians and general
      practitioners, a complete overview on its intrinsic characteristics, preclinical 
      and clinical evaluations, uses in different situations as supportive therapy in
      the management of the main intestinal functional disorders both in adults and in 
      children. METHODS: All the papers on PHGG, published from the early 1990s of the 
      Last Century to the Year 2013, have been considered. All types of publications
      have been included. PubMed, Medline, Ovid were the main sources adopted for data 
      retrieving. RESULTS: PHGG has been studied in both animals and humans; its safety
      is well known and several clinical uses are well established. Concerning the
      modulation of metabolism in human, very little has been done to date and the
      studies have been focused, for the most part, on the functional diseases: PHGG
      has been proved to be useful in treating both IBS -C and D symptoms, not only in 
      adults but also in children; data on constipation are relatively scarce and what 
      can be deduced from the Literature is that the high concentration of fiber gives 
      the PHGG the possibility of being used effectively in acceptable dosages (up to
      22 g/day) even in situations such as chronic constipation. The use in clinical
      nutrition has revealed the flexibility of the compound which, owing to its
      peculiar characteristics, does not gel and remains liquid, PHGG can be used
      successfully in patients in enteral nutrition lowering the incidence of diarrhea.
      New open horizons can be glimpsed for SIBO treatment, lowering or maximizing the 
      antibiotics use. CONCLUSION: Not all the fibers are the same: this is a fact.
      Promoting the specific knowledge of their characteristics is very important if
      healthcare professionals want to give their patients the best options for
      functional gastrointestinal disorders or nutritional needs. PHGG (Benefiber
      Novartis CH) has been proved to be safe and effective in promoting gut health.

TI  - Impact of eating restriction on gastrointestinal motility in adolescents with
      IBS.
PG  - 491-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000228 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal disturbances as a result of changes in eating
      patterns have been described in eating disorders. Many patients who experience
      irritable bowel syndrome report changes in eating patterns as a way to cope with 
      their symptoms. Little is known about the consequences of these practices. The
      aim of this study was to explore whether repeated eating restriction (defined as 
      not eating >/= 4 hours while hungry) is associated with motility disturbances.
      METHODS: Of 17 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, subjects were divided into
      those who habitually restrict their eating (n = 8) and those without eating
      restriction (n = 9) (age range 15-21, mean 19.2; 64.7% girls). Whole-gut transit 
      time was measured by radiopaque markers, gastric sensitivity was measured by
      water load test (drinking max of 800 mL of water in 5 minutes or until full), and
      gastric dysrhythmias by an electrogastrogram. RESULTS: Restrictors drank less
      water (mean 464.4 mL) than nonrestrictors (mean 613 mL; P = 0.02). No difference 
      was found in gastric dysrhythmias (62.5% vs 77.8%; P = 0.5). Whole-gut transit
      tended to be slower in the restrictors (mean 51.0 hours) than in nonrestrictors
      (mean 37.5 hours), but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Eating restriction 
      appears to be associated with increased gastric sensation. More data are needed
      from larger studies to determine whether eating behaviors are associated with
      other motility disturbances.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common gastrointestinal problems. It is
      characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in 
      stool frequency and/or consistency. The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be
      multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in 
      gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut 
      epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain
      psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory.
      There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal
      microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in
      certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition.
      Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract.
      Recently, many studies have suggested that probiotics are effective in the
      treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex. The
      purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and mechanisms for the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of IBS.

TI  - How patients with long-term experience of living with irritable bowel syndrome
      manage illness in daily life: a qualitative study.
PG  - 1478-83
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328365abd3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, disabling and functional
      gastrointestinal disorder. Effective treatments are lacking. Self-care and coping
      with symptoms are considered important but little is known about what patients
      with IBS actually do to manage their illness. The aim of this study was to
      explore how patients with long-term experience of living with IBS perceive their 
      situation and manage illness in daily life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study
      adopted a qualitative approach - an interpretative phenomenological analysis.
      Twenty patients with IBS (16 women) with a mean age of 46 (27-74) years were
      interviewed. The mean IBS duration was 24 (7-65) years. RESULTS: Two themes
      emerged from the analysis: Healed but not cured and Take control of daily life.
      Healed but not cured is about mastering IBS. Even though the patients feel there 
      has been an improvement, their abdomen is constantly present. The patients live
      with intermittent interaction between well-being and illness and construct
      explanations for the cause of the IBS symptoms. Taking control of daily life is
      about the activities the patients perform to master IBS symptoms:
      self-centredness, disciplined self-care, control over daily routines and finding 
      social support. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the negative impact of IBS
      on daily life can be reduced. Over time, the patients had found effective
      strategies for symptom improvement, although this is a long-term learning
      process. The healthcare system could be more effective in supporting patients to 
      find solutions to problems caused by IBS that are consistent with person-centred 
      care and could be adopted as part of different supportive/educational
      interventions.

TI  - Genetic variants in CDC42 and NXPH1 as susceptibility factors for constipation
      and diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1103-11
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304570 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The complex genetic aetiology underlying irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) needs to be assessed in large-scale genetic studies. Two independent IBS
      cohorts were genotyped to assess whether genetic variability in immune, neuronal 
      and barrier integrity genes is associated with IBS. DESIGN: 384 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 270 genes were genotyped in an exploratory cohort
      (935 IBS patients, 639 controls). 33 SNPs with Puncorrected<0.05 were validated
      in an independent set of 497 patients and 887 controls. Genotype distributions of
      single SNPs were assessed using an additive genetic model in IBS and clinical
      subtypes, IBS-C and IBS-D, both in individual and combined cohorts. Trait anxiety
      (N=614 patients, 533 controls), lifetime depression (N=654 patients, 533
      controls) and mRNA expression in rectal biopsies (N=22 patients, 29 controls)
      were correlated with SNP genotypes. RESULTS: Two SNPs associated independently in
      the exploratory and validation cohort: rs17837965-CDC42 with IBS-C
      (ORexploratory=1.59 (1.05 to 1.76); ORvalidation=1.76 (1.03 to 3.01)) and
      rs2349775-NXPH1 with IBS-D (ORexploratory=1.28 (1.06 to 1.56); ORvalidation=1.42 
      (1.08 to 1.88)). When combining both cohorts, the association of rs2349775
      withstood post hoc correction for multiple testing in the IBS-D subgroup.
      Additionally, three SNPs in immune-related genes (rs1464510-LPP, rs1881457-IL13, 
      rs2104286-IL2RA), one SNP in a neuronal gene (rs2349775-NXPH1) and two SNPs in
      epithelial genes (rs245051-SLC26A2, rs17837965-CDC42) were weakly associated with
      total-IBS (Puncorrected<0.05). At the functional level, rs1881457 increased IL13 
      mRNA levels, whereas anxiety and depression scores did not correlate with
      rs2349775-NXPH1. CONCLUSIONS: Rs2349775 (NXPH1) and rs17837965 (CDC42) were
      associated with IBS-D and IBS-C, respectively, in two independent cohorts.
      Further studies are warranted to validate our findings and to determine the
      mechanisms underlying IBS pathophysiology.

TI  - Gastrointestinal manifestations in mastocytosis: a study of 83 patients.
PG  - 866-73.e1-3

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous disease characterized by mast cell
      accumulation in 1 or more organs. Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic
      mastocytosis have been previously studied in small cohorts of patients, and no
      specific histologic description is available. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the 
      clinical and pathologic features of gastrointestinal manifestations in patients
      with mastocytosis. METHODS: Medical history and gastrointestinal symptoms of
      patients with mastocytosis (n = 83) were compared with those of matched healthy
      subjects (n = 83) by means of patient questionnaire. Data were analyzed for
      epidemiologic, clinical, biological, and genetic factors associated with
      gastrointestinal symptoms for patients with mastocytosis. A comparative analysis 
      of gastrointestinal histology from patients with mastocytosis (n = 23), control
      subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 17), and healthy subjects (n = 19) 
      was performed. RESULTS: The following gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more
      frequently and were more severe in patients with mastocytosis than in healthy
      subjects: bloating (33% vs 7.2%, P < .0001), abdominal pain (27.3% vs 4.8%, P <
      .0001), nausea (23% vs 8.4%, P = .02), and diarrhea (33.85% vs 1.2%, P < .0001). 
      Patients with mastocytosis had a significantly higher incidence of personal
      history of duodenal ulcer (P = .02). Wild-type (WT) c-Kit was associated with
      diarrhea (P = .03). Specific histologic lesions were present in patients with
      mastocytosis but were not correlated with clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION:
      Gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with mastocytosis are highly
      prevalent and often severe. Clinical symptoms do not correspond to histologic
      findings, are nonspecific, and can simulate irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Assessment of abdominal pain through global outcomes and recent FDA
      recommendations in children: are we ready for change?
PG  - 46-50
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182a20764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome is a multisymptom construct, with abdominal 
      pain (AP) acting as the driving symptom of patient-reported severity. The Food
      and Drug Administration considers a >30% decrease in AP as satisfactory
      improvement, but this has not been validated in children. We investigated the
      correspondence of 2 measures for AP assessment, >/=30% improvement in AP and
      global assessment of improvement. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from 72
      children who completed a randomized clinical trial for abdominal pain-associated 
      functional gastrointestinal disorders. Children completed daily assessment of AP 
      intensity, functional disability inventory (FDI), question regarding pain's
      interference with activities, and 2 global assessment questions. We measured the 
      extent to which >/=30% improvement of AP and global assessment questions
      correlated with each other and with disability. RESULTS: The global questions
      correlated with each other (r=0.74; P<0.0001) and with a >/=30% improvement in AP
      (P<0.01). Global outcomes were satisfaction with treatment was inversely related 
      to the child's report of interference with activities (P<0.01) and symptom relief
      was positively associated with >/=30% improvement in FDI scores (P<0.009). A 30% 
      change in FDI scores was associated with global questions of symptom relief
      (P=0.009) but not with satisfaction with treatment (P=0.07). The association of
      AP improvement with interference with activities (P=0.14) or change in FDI scores
      (P=0.27) did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used global
      assessments are significantly associated with decreased pain intensity, decreased
      interference with daily activities, and a >/=30% change in FDI scores, whereas
      recommended 30% improvement in pain intensity is not as comprehensive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), and in particular
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), pose a considerable burden on health care and
      society, and negatively impact quality of life. These are common conditions of
      unknown etiology, and symptom-based criteria are currently the sole nosological
      tools for their clinical classification. Major insight into FGID pathophysiology 
      is therefore needed and, in recent years, increasing hope has been put on genetic
      research for the identification of causative pathways. This is more advanced in
      IBS compared with other FGID, but it has still provided often indecipherable
      results and no unequivocal evidence of a pathogenetic role for any particular
      gene. Although thousands of genetic variants have been undoubtedly linked to
      human disease in hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), no similar
      effort has yet even been attempted in FGID. If meaningful, robust, and
      reproducible results are to be obtained for IBS and other FGID, we must shift
      gear and adopt these powerful hypothesis-free approaches through concerted
      actions and allocation of adequate resources. Provided these are in place, the
      major challenge will be, inevitably, the choice of the target phenotype(s) beyond
      a descriptive symptom-based classification. PURPOSE: In view of these much
      awaited developments, salient results and difficulties inherent to IBS gene
      discovery are briefly summarized here.

      young Japanese women.
PG  - 1295-301
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal
      disorder. The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III criteria in young Japanese
      women and to assess the effects of mental, physical, dietary and nutritional
      factors on IBS. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data obtained from
      self-administered questionnaires, including age, height, weight, lifestyle, food 
      habits, anxiety and depressive states and IBS-related symptoms, were analyzed in 
      245 participants. An established semiquantitative questionnaire available for
      clinical investigation (FFQg) was used to obtain a detailed assessment of food
      intake and the physical activity levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was
      12.0%. Of the IBS participants, constipation-predominant IBS (25.0%) was more
      prevalent than the diarrhea-predominant subtype (17.9%). The IBS participants had
      lower body mass indices, consumed less eggs and milk and were more physically
      active than the non-IBS participants. In addition, an anxiety state was more
      common in the IBS participants. Those who hesitated with evacuation of stool and 
      who thought that there is an association between abdominal symptoms, such as
      constipation and diarrhea, and menstruation were more predominant among the IBS
      participants. The percentage of individuals who reported often rushing to the
      toilet within the past year and experiencing borborygmus (rumbling stomach) was
      greater among the IBS participants. A logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      milk intake was an independent predictor of IBS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of
      IBS observed in this study was similar to that reported in previous studies
      conducted in Japan and other countries. Mental, physical, dietary and nutritional
      factors have an impact on IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To hypothesize that hernia repair would not change the incidence of
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) due to the benign and limited
      nature of the procedure. STUDY DESIGN: This cohort study assessed a randomized
      selection of children aged 4-18 years who underwent hernia repair more than 4
      years prior at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Controls
      were siblings who had not undergone surgery previously. Parents completed the
      Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III Version by
      telephone for subjects and controls. The primary outcome was the presence of
      FGIDs. RESULTS: Fifty children with hernia repair and 43 sibling controls were
      identified. At the time of survey, subjects with hernia repair were average age
      12.9 years (range 5-18 years, 60% male) and controls were average age 12.2 years 
      (range 4-18 years, 49% male). Average age at surgical repair was 5.2 years
      (median 5.2 years, range 0.2-10.4 years) and average time since surgical repair
      was 7.8 years (range 4.8-13.7 years). FGIDs were diagnosed in 10/50 (20%) cases
      of hernia repair and 2/43 (5%) controls (P = .033, Fisher 2-tailed test).
      CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical hernia repair increases the likelihood of FGIDs in
      childhood. Additional studies are needed to identify aspects of surgery that may 
      be associated with development of FGIDs.

TI  - Influence of tianeptine on melatonin homeostasis and psychosomatic symptoms in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 177-83
AB  - UNLABELLED: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exert beneficial
      effect on gastrointestinal tract (GIT), but its mechanism has not been
      recognized. One of the hypothesis assumes, that fluoxetine increases indirectly
      melatonin production. For this reason it can be hypothesized, that administration
      of drugs of opposite effect, for example tianepine (selective serotonin reuptake 
      enhancer (SSRE), can reduce melatonin production resulting in harmful effects as 
      regards GIT. The aim of the study was to confirm or reject this hypothesis. The
      study included 100 patients, aged 21-58 years, with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). Basing on the Rome III Criteria patients with constipation-predominant
      (IBS-C, n=50) and with diarrhoea-predominant (IBS-D, n=50) and 25 health
      volunteers (control group C) were distinguished. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were used to determine the severity of
      somatic and psychic symptoms. The concentration of 6-sultatoxymelatonin (6-HMS)
      in the urine was measured by ELISA method. In both groups the patients were
      administrated tianeptine 12.5 mg three times daily or placebo for 8 weeks. After 
      8 weeks of tianeptine therapy no significant changes were found in urinary 6-HMS 
      excretion both in IBS-C group (9.9+/-3.2 versus 11.5+/-3.5 mug/24 h) and in IBS-D
      group (11.8+/-3.3 versus 12.2+/-3.5 mug/24 h). Eight-week tianeptine therapy
      resulted in significant decrease of somatic and psychic symptoms in both
      investigated groups. The improvement in the quality of life indices was obtained 
      in 76.5% of IBS-C and in 63.3% of IBS-D patients. CONCLUSIONS: tianeptine does
      not impair melatonin homeostasis in patients with IB, diminishes IBS symptoms and
      improves the patients' quality of life.

TI  - Decreased levels of kynurenic acid in the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients:
      relation to serotonin and psychological state.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2013.01.008 [doi]
LID - S0022-3999(13)00025-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with psychiatric
      comorbidity and alterations in serotonergic metabolism. Tryptophan is the
      precursor of serotonin (5-HT), but it is mainly catabolized through the
      kynurenine pathway. This pathway may also be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS 
      by virtue of deviating tryptophan from the 5-HT pathway resulting in 5-HT
      deficiency. We therefore aimed to ascertain the mucosal and systemic
      concentrations of 5-HT and kynurenic acid (KYNA), a principal kynurenine
      metabolite. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal biopsy specimens and platelet poor plasma
      samples were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers and 15 IBS patients.
      Psychological state was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      and the Symptom Checklist-90. RESULTS: IBS patients showed significantly lower
      mucosal and higher systemic concentrations of both 5-HT and KYNA compared to
      healthy controls. Also, significant correlation between mucosal but not plasma
      concentrations of KYNA and 5-HT and psychological state in IBS was observed.
      CONCLUSION: The observation that mucosal KYNA and 5-HT are both decreased in IBS 
      does not support the hypothesis that increased activation along the kynurenic
      pathway results in relative 5-HT deficiency. However, an increased release of
      these substances from the intestine to the systemic compartment may lead to a
      decrease in intestinal KYNA and 5-HT levels, resulting in disturbance of
      intestinal homeostasis. Thus, changes in psychological states observed in IBS
      patients may be secondary to alterations in gastrointestinal function, and in
      particular kynurenine and/or 5-HT metabolism.

      clinical remission.
PG  - 756-e578
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms compatible with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      (IBS) are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It has been
      suggested that these symptoms are a reflection of occult inflammation rather than
      coexisting IBS. The aim of this study was to characterize IBS-like symptoms in
      patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in clinical remission by assessing
      inflammatory markers, psychological symptoms, and quality of life. METHODS:
      Ninety-four patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively during 3
      years with yearly follow-up visits. The patients completed self-administrated
      questionnaires. Fecal calprotectin was used as an inflammatory biomarker.
      Remission was defined as a total Mayo-score </=2 and an endoscopic subscore </=1,
      with no relapse during the 3-month period prior to visit. KEY RESULTS: The
      prevalence of patients that fulfilled Rome II criteria for IBS among UC patients 
      in remission was 11% at visit 1, 23% at visit 2, and 17% at visit 3. When
      comparing UC patients in remission with and without IBS-like symptom, patients
      with IBS-like symptoms had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, tendencies
      toward more severe psychological symptoms and reduced levels of quality of life, 
      but the calprotectin levels did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS & 
      INFERENCES: IBS-like symptoms are common in patients with UC in clinical
      remission and these fluctuate over time. The symptoms are associated with poor
      psychological well-being and reduced quality of life, and do not seem to be a
      reflection of low-grade inflammatory activity.

TI  - Luminal cysteine-proteases degrade colonic tight junction structure and are
      responsible for abdominal pain in constipation-predominant IBS.
PG  - 1322-31
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.152 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Luminal serine-proteases lead to increased colonic paracellular
      permeability and visceral hypersensitivity in patients with diarrhea-predominant 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Other proteases, namely cysteine-proteases
      (CPs), increase airway permeability by digesting epithelial tight junction
      proteins. In this study, we focused on constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and
      we aimed to (i) evaluate CP levels in two cohorts of IBS patients, (ii) test if
      IBS-C fecal supernatant (FSN) affects permeability, and visceral sensitivity
      after repeated administrations in mice, and (iii) evaluate occludin expression in
      IBS-C colonic biopsies. METHODS: Fecal CP activity was determined using selective
      substrate and inhibitor (E64). The effect of papain, as positive control, and
      IBS-C FSN administrations were evaluated on colonic paracellular permeability and
      mucosal occludin levels in mice and T84 monolayers. Occludin protein levels were 
      evaluated in IBS-C colonic biopsies. Sensitivity to colorectal distension (CRD)
      was measured after repeated administrations of IBS-C FSN. RESULTS: We found in a 
      subset of IBS-C patients an enhanced fecal CP activity, in comparison with
      healthy controls and IBS-D patients. CP activity levels positively correlated
      with disease severity and abdominal pain scoring. This association was confirmed 
      by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In mice, repeated
      application of IBS-C FSN into colon triggered increased permeability, linked to
      the enzymatic degradation of occludin, and was associated with enhanced visceral 
      sensitivity to CRD. Finally, occludin levels were found decreased in colonic
      biopsies from IBS-C patients, and IBS-C FSNs were able to degrade recombinant
      human occludin in vitro. All these effects were abolished by preincubation of
      IBS-C FSN with a CP inhibitor, E64. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that luminal 
      CPs may represent a new factor contributing to the genesis of symptoms in IBS.

TI  - Mechanisms and effectiveness of prebiotics in modifying the gastrointestinal
      microbiota for the management of digestive disorders.
PG  - 288-98
LID - 10.1017/S0029665113001262 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with each human individual
      hosting at least 160 different bacterial strains. Our understanding of its role
      is rapidly expanding as a result of the molecular microbiological techniques that
      can accurately characterise its composition and 'omics' technologies that measure
      its metabolic activity. Since 1995, extensive research has investigated the
      prebiotic concept, which describes how supplementation of some non-digestible
      oligosaccharides can stimulate the growth and/or activity of specific genera
      including bifidobacteria. However, the vast majority of studies are in healthy
      human subjects, with few undertaken in patients with disorders relevant to
      clinical nutrition. Marked alterations of the luminal microbiota have been
      demonstrated in patients with digestive disorders, highlighting mechanisms
      through which they might be involved in their pathogenesis, including higher
      clostridia in patients who develop diarrhoea during enteral nutrition and the
      influence of bifidobacteria on intestinal dendritic cell phenotype in Crohn's
      disease. The impact of prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of healthy people 
      has not been consistently replicated in patients with digestive disorders. For
      example, a number of studies show that inulin/oligofructose do not increase
      bifidobacteria in enteral nutrition and Crohn's disease. Indeed, in Crohn's
      disease and irritable bowel syndrome there is evidence that some prebiotics in
      high doses worsen functional symptoms. Unlike healthy human subjects, patients
      experience a number of issues that may alter their gastrointestinal microbiota
      (disease, antibiotics and inflammation) and the use of microbiota modifying
      therapies, such as prebiotics, do not always elicit the same effects in patients 
      as they do in healthy people.

TI  - Influence of melatonin on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in postmenopausal 
      women.
PG  - 114-20
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Melatonin (MEL) exerts beneficial effects on the gut partly by
      myorelaxative properties upon the smooth muscle. Its secretion decreases with
      age, particularly in postmenopausal women. This study was aimed at evaluating the
      effect of MEL on the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in this group of 
      patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigations were carried out in 80
      postmenopausal women, aged 48-65 years, divided into two equal groups, diagnosed 
      according to Rome Criteria III: i.e. patients with IBS with constipation
      predominant (IBS-C), and patients with IBS with diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D).
      The control group (C) included healthy women aged 46-65 years. In all subjects,
      6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-HMS) concentration urine was measured using ELISA assay. 
      Patients in both groups over the course of six months were given melatonin (at a 
      dose of 3 mg fasting and 5 mg at bedtime) or a placebo (double blind trial).
      Disease activity was evaluated after two, four and six months, using a ten-point 
      scale to assess the main somatic symptoms: visceral pain, abdominal bloating,
      etc. RESULTS: The amounts of 6-HMS urine excretion (mug/24 h) were: C 11.4 +/-
      3.0, IBS-C 10.2 +/- 3.2, IBS-D 14.0 +/- 6.3 (p < 0.05). Correlation between
      values of symptoms score and contrary excretion of 6-HMS: IBS-C r = -0.714, IBS-D
      r = 0.409. After six months in the IBS-C group, the intensity of visceral pain
      and abdominal bloating had decreased in 70% of patients (p < 0.01) and
      constipation in 50% of patients (p < 0.05). Beneficial changes in the IBS-D group
      were noted in 45% of patients, but this was not better compared to the placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin can be used as part of the treatment of IBS, particularly 
      in patients with constipation-predominant IBS.

      gastrointestinal symptoms.
PG  - 300-6
LID - 10.1177/0884533613485790 [doi]
AB  - The Monash University low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols) diet is now accepted as an effective strategy for
      managing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Australia, with interest
      expanding across the world. These poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates have
      been shown to induce IBS symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and
      flatus due to their poor absorption, osmotic activity, and rapid fermentation.
      Four clinical trials have been published to date, all with significant
      symptomatic response to the low FODMAP diet. Up to 86% of patients with IBS have 
      achieved relief of overall gastrointestinal symptoms and, more specifically,
      bloating, flatus, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habit from the approach. This
      review provides an overview of the low FODMAP diet and summarizes the research to
      date, emerging concepts, and limitations. FODMAPs are known to be beneficial to
      bowel health; the importance of this and how this should be considered in the
      clinical management of IBS is also discussed. A clinical management flowchart is 
      provided to assist nutrition professionals in the use of this approach.

PG  - 289-99
LID - 10.1177/0884533613485882 [doi]
AB  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can result from failure of the
      gastric acid barrier, failure of small intestinal motility, anatomic alterations,
      or impairment of systemic and local immunity. The current accepted criteria for
      the diagnosis of SIBO is the presence of coliform bacteria isolated from the
      proximal jejunum with >10(5) colony-forming units/mL. A major concern with
      luminal aspiration is that it is only one random sampling of the small intestine 
      and may not always be representative of the underlying microbiota. A new approach
      to examine the underlying microbiota uses rapid molecular sequencing, but its
      clinical utilization is still under active investigation. Clinical manifestations
      of SIBO are variable and include bloating, flatulence, abdominal distention,
      abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Severe cases may present with nutrition
      deficiencies due to malabsorption of micro- and macronutrients. The current
      management strategies for SIBO center on identifying and correcting underlying
      causes, addressing nutrition deficiencies, and judicious utilization of
      antibiotics to treat symptomatic SIBO.

TI  - Short-chain carbohydrates and functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 707-17
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.96 [doi]
AB  - Carbohydrates occur across a range of foods regularly consumed including grains
      such as wheat and rye, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Short-chain carbohydrates
      with chains of up to 10 sugars vary in their digestibility and subsequent
      absorption. Those that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the
      intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by
      bacteria with consequent gas production. These two effects alone may underlie
      most of the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms after they are ingested in
      moderate amounts via luminal distension in patients with visceral
      hypersensitivity. This has been the basis of the use of lactose-free diets in
      those with lactose malabsorption and of fructose-reduced diets for fructose
      malabsorption. However, application of such dietary approaches in patients with
      functional bowel disorders has been restricted to observational studies with
      uncertain efficacy. As all dietary poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates have
      similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has been developed to
      regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a dietary approach that restricts
      them all. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, there is now an accumulating
      body of evidence, based on observational and comparative studies, and on
      randomized-controlled trials that supports the notion that FODMAPs trigger
      gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders, and that a
      diet low in FODMAPs offers considerable symptom relief in the majority of
      patients who use it.

AB  - Gut microbiota alterations are increasingly being recognized as an important
      factor in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      The onset of IBS symptoms after a bout of gastroenteritis comprises one of the
      strongest indications for the importance of gut microbiota for IBS. Moreover,
      recent studies have identified several susceptibility genes for IBS involved in
      the innate immunity and recognition of bacteria but also maintaining the
      integrity of the intestinal barrier. During recent years, it has also been
      demonstrated that IBS patients, or subgroups thereof, may have an altered
      microbiota composition relative to healthy individuals, mainly based on the
      analysis of fecal microbiota. Moreover, a positive effect of treatment with
      non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics in IBS provides further indirect
      support for the relevance of gut microbiota alterations in IBS.

TI  - Alterations in mucosal neuropeptides in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      and ulcerative colitis in remission: a role in pain symptom generation?
PG  - 1299-306
LID - 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2013.00309.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal
      disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor
      potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain
      signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads
      to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We
      hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by
      increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We
      therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of
      somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their 
      relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were
      collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9
      healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by
      radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides
      were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain
      symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a
      possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and
      somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not
      sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably
      explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive
      mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.

TI  - Does our food (environment) change our gut microbiome ('in-vironment'): a
      potential role for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 184-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835d7bba [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

TI  - Gut-directed hypnotherapy for functional abdominal pain or irritable bowel
      syndrome in children: a systematic review.
PG  - 252-7
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2012-302906 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gut directed hypnotherapy (HT) is shown to be effective in adult
      functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. We
      performed a systematic review to assess efficacy of HT in paediatric FAP/IBS
      patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Cumulative Index to
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) in children with FAP or 
      IBS, investigating efficacy of HT on the following outcomes: abdominal pain
      scores, quality of life, costs and school absenteeism. RESULTS: Three RCT
      comparing HT to a control treatment were included with sample sizes ranging from 
      22 to 52 children. We refrained from statistical pooling because of low number of
      studies and many differences in design and outcomes. Two studies examined HT
      performed by a therapist, one examined HT through self-exercises on audio CD. All
      trials showed statistically significantly greater improvement in abdominal pain
      scores among children receiving HT. One trial reported beneficial effects
      sustained after 1 year of follow-up. One trial reported statistically significant
      improvement in quality of life in the HT group. Two trials reported significant
      reductions in school absenteeism after HT. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic effects of HT
      seem superior to standard medical care in children with FAP or IBS. It remains
      difficult to quantify exact benefits. The need for more high quality research is 
      evident.

TI  - Functions of intestinal microflora in children.
PG  - 31-8
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835a3500 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the structural composition of intestinal
      microbiota, the functional relationship between the latter and the host, and the 
      role of abnormal microflora in chronic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: A more complete
      view of the gut microbiota is being developed following the Human Microbiome
      Project. The microflora in children is plastic, susceptible to changes in
      response to diet modifications, antibiotic treatment and other events, providing 
      the opportunity to study its functional role. Increasing evidence highlights the 
      role of nutrition in the age-related development of microflora. Eubiosis, that
      is, a normal microflora structure, provides protection against infections,
      educates the immune system, ensures tolerance to foods, and contributes to
      nutrient digestion and energy harvest. Changes in microflora, consisting in the
      overpresence of harmful species or underpresence of commensal species, or
      dysbiosis produce dysfunctions, such as intestinal inflammation or dysmotility.
      Moreover abnormal pattern of microflora have been consistently detected in
      specific diseases. SUMMARY: A relationship exists between eubiosis and functions 
      and conversely between dysbiosis and dysfunctions or even diseases. Abnormalities
      in microflora composition may trigger or contribute to specific diseases. This
      raises the hypothesis to target microflora in order to restore eubiosis through
      the use of antibiotics, probiotics or nutrients.

TI  - Nutrient intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with the
      general population.
PG  - 23-30.e1
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS.
      Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to
      the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups
      based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate 
      if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187
      IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food
      registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control 
      group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic
      Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was 
      similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations.
      Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from
      macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended
      to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher
      daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well
      as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no
      association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food
      items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large
      extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency
      toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy
      products in IBS patients.

TI  - Functional gastrointestinal symptoms in children with anxiety disorders.

AB  - This study examined the incidence and correlates of functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms in children with anxiety disorders. Participants were 6-13 year old
      children diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders (n = 54) and non-clinical
      control children (n = 51). Telephone diagnostic interviews were performed with
      parents to determine the presence and absence of anxiety disorders in children.
      Parents completed a questionnaire that elicited information about their child's
      gastrointestinal symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders
      in children, as specified by the paediatric Rome criteria (Caplan et al., Journal
      of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition, 41, 296-304, 2005a). Parents and
      children also completed a symptom severity measure of anxiety. As expected,
      children with anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to have symptoms
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), compared to children without
      anxiety disorders. That is, 40.7 % of anxious children had symptoms of a FGID
      compared to 5.9 % of non-anxious control children. Children with anxiety
      disorders were significantly more likely to have symptoms of functional
      constipation, and showed a trend for a higher incidence of irritable bowel
      syndrome symptoms compared to non-anxious control children. Furthermore, higher
      anxiety symptom severity was characteristic of anxious children with symptoms of 
      FGID, compared to anxious children without FGID symptoms and non-anxious control 
      children. Also, children with anxiety disorders, regardless of FGID symptoms,
      were more likely to have a biological family member, particularly a parent or
      grandparent, with a gastrointestinal problem, compared to non-anxious control
      children. The high incidence of FGID symptoms in children with anxiety disorders 
      warrants further research on whether gastrointestinal symptoms reduce following
      psychological treatments for childhood anxiety disorders, such as cognitive
      behavioural therapy.
