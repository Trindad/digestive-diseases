TI  - Current level of consensus on probiotic science--report of an expert

AB  - The present paper summarizes the consensus views of a group of 9 European
      clinicians and scientists on the current state of scientific knowledge on
      probiotics, covering those areas where there is substantial evidence for
      beneficial effects and those where the evidence base is poor or inconsistent.
      There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain 
      specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the 
      incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile
      infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in
      irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can 
      reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature
      infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other
      clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel
      disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori 
      adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.

TI  - Kiwifruit improves bowel function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with 
      constipation.
PG  - 451-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder of the
      gastrointestinal system, and is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea
      (IBS/D), constipation (IBS/C), and alternating diarrhea and constipation
      (IBSC/A). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week
      kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C.
      Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. 
      All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a
      baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a
      post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults
      consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4
      weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per
      day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and
      following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation
      records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly
      increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05).
      Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that
      consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4
      weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves
      bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in pediatrics.
PG  - 1217-31
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2548 [doi]
AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

TI  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 gastrointestinal regulatory role in metabolism and
      motility.
PG  - 319-29
LID - 10.1016/B978-0-12-381517-0.00012-6 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) motility, primarily gastric emptying, balances the hormonal
      output that takes place after food intake in order to maintain stable blood
      sugar. The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), work together to reduce
      postprandial hyperglycemia by glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibition 
      of glucagon release, as well as inhibition of GI motility and gastric emptying.
      GLP-1 is considered the more effective of the two incretins due to its additional
      inhibitory effects on GI motility. It is observed that patients on treatment with
      GLP-1 analogues or exenatide achieve a considerable weight loss during treatment.
      This is of benefit to improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore,
      weight loss per se is of considerable benefit in an even longer health
      perspective. The weight loss is considered to be due to the inhibition of GI
      motility. This effect has been studied in animal experimentation, and from there 
      taken to involve studies on GI motility in healthy volunteers and patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evolving to a phase II study in IBS, the GLP-1
      analogue (ROSE-010) was recently shown to be effective for treatment of acute
      pain attacks in IBS. Taken together, data speak in favor of GI motility as a
      central component not only in metabolic disorders but also in IBS, be it due to a
      direct relaxing effect on GI smooth muscle or a slow emptying of gastric contents
      resulting in a less outspoken nutritional demand on hormonal regulatory functions
      in the GI tract.

TI  - Obesity predicts persistence of pain in children with functional gastrointestinal
      disorders.
PG  - 517-21
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2010.245 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The possible effect of obesity in the outcome of treated children with
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) has not yet 
      been studied. We hypothesized that obesity is associated with a poor long-term
      prognosis in children with FGIDs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in an
      outpatient clinic-based sample of patients diagnosed with abdominal pain-related 
      FGIDs. Principal outcome measured was persistence of pain at long-term follow-up 
      (12-15 months). Frequency of pain, intensity of pain, school absenteeism and
      disruption of daily activities were compared between obese and non-obese
      subjects. RESULTS: The group mean age was 13.27+/-3.84 years, distribution of
      diagnosis was 32% (functional abdominal pain), 42.5% (irritable bowel syndrome)
      and 25.5% (functional dyspepsia). Overall, 20.2% of patients were obese. A total 
      of 116 patients (61.7%) reported abdominal pain and 72 (38.3%) were asymptomatic 
      at long-term follow-up. Obese patients were more likely to have abdominal pain
      (P<0.0001), higher intensity of pain (P=0.0002), higher frequency of pain
      (P=0.0032), school absenteeism (P<0.0001) and disruption of daily activities
      (P<0.0001) at follow-up than non-obese patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity is
      associated with poor outcome and disability at long-term follow-up in children
      with abdominal pain-related FGIDs. Our novel findings could have important
      implications in the prognosis and management of FGIDs.

TI  - Should military dining facilities offer and promote consumption of
      probiotic-containing foods?
PG  - 770-83
AB  - Probiotics are defined as "live organisms which, when administered in adequate
      amounts confer a benefit on the host." The purpose of this review was to
      determine whether there is evidence-based justification to recommend purchase and
      promotion of probiotic-containing food in military dining facilities (DFACs).
      Peer-reviewed literature was searched to identify well-conducted systematic
      reviews and original research related to the efficacy of probiotics in preventing
      and/or treating acute infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory 
      tract infections, allergic rhinitis, dental health issues, and female urogenital 
      conditions. Probiotics may be useful for preventing and/or treating
      military-relevant health conditions. However, the available scientific evidence
      is not sufficient to warrant widespread procurement and promotion of
      probiotic-containing food items in military DFACs. Health care practitioners
      considering recommending probiotics should understand that health effects and
      clinical outcomes discussed herein are specific to the probiotic strain, dose,
      and method of delivery studied in the articles cited.

AB  - The different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract are inhabited by
      populations of micro-organisms. By far the most important predominant populations
      are in the colon where a true symbiosis with the host exists that is a key for
      well-being and health. For such a microbiota, 'normobiosis' characterises a
      composition of the gut 'ecosystem' in which micro-organisms with potential health
      benefits predominate in number over potentially harmful ones, in contrast to
      'dysbiosis', in which one or a few potentially harmful micro-organisms are
      dominant, thus creating a disease-prone situation. The present document has been 
      written by a group of both academic and industry experts (in the ILSI Europe
      Prebiotic Expert Group and Prebiotic Task Force, respectively). It does not aim
      to propose a new definition of a prebiotic nor to identify which food products
      are classified as prebiotic but rather to validate and expand the original idea
      of the prebiotic concept (that can be translated in 'prebiotic effects'), defined
      as: 'The selective stimulation of growth and/or activity(ies) of one or a limited
      number of microbial genus(era)/species in the gut microbiota that confer(s)
      health benefits to the host.' Thanks to the methodological and fundamental
      research of microbiologists, immense progress has very recently been made in our 
      understanding of the gut microbiota. A large number of human intervention studies
      have been performed that have demonstrated that dietary consumption of certain
      food products can result in statistically significant changes in the composition 
      of the gut microbiota in line with the prebiotic concept. Thus the prebiotic
      effect is now a well-established scientific fact. The more data are accumulating,
      the more it will be recognised that such changes in the microbiota's composition,
      especially increase in bifidobacteria, can be regarded as a marker of intestinal 
      health. The review is divided in chapters that cover the major areas of nutrition
      research where a prebiotic effect has tentatively been investigated for potential
      health benefits. The prebiotic effect has been shown to associate with modulation
      of biomarkers and activity(ies) of the immune system. Confirming the studies in
      adults, it has been demonstrated that, in infant nutrition, the prebiotic effect 
      includes a significant change of gut microbiota composition, especially an
      increase of faecal concentrations of bifidobacteria. This concomitantly improves 
      stool quality (pH, SCFA, frequency and consistency), reduces the risk of
      gastroenteritis and infections, improves general well-being and reduces the
      incidence of allergic symptoms such as atopic eczema. Changes in the gut
      microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors
      involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable
      bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has
      thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical
      activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Promising beneficial
      effects have been demonstrated in some preliminary studies, including changes in 
      gut microbiota composition (especially increase in bifidobacteria concentration).
      Often associated with toxic load and/or miscellaneous risk factors, colon cancer 
      is another pathology for which a possible role of gut microbiota composition has 
      been hypothesised. Numerous experimental studies have reported reduction in
      incidence of tumours and cancers after feeding specific food products with a
      prebiotic effect. Some of these studies (including one human trial) have also
      reported that, in such conditions, gut microbiota composition was modified
      (especially due to increased concentration of bifidobacteria). Dietary intake of 
      particular food products with a prebiotic effect has been shown, especially in
      adolescents, but also tentatively in postmenopausal women, to increase Ca
      absorption as well as bone Ca accretion and bone mineral density. Recent data,
      both from experimental models and from human studies, support the beneficial
      effects of particular food products with prebiotic properties on energy
      homaeostasis, satiety regulation and body weight gain. Together, with data in
      obese animals and patients, these studies support the hypothesis that gut
      microbiota composition (especially the number of bifidobacteria) may contribute
      to modulate metabolic processes associated with syndrome X, especially obesity
      and diabetes type 2. It is plausible, even though not exclusive, that these
      effects are linked to the microbiota-induced changes and it is feasible to
      conclude that their mechanisms fit into the prebiotic effect. However, the role
      of such changes in these health benefits remains to be definitively proven. As a 
      result of the research activity that followed the publication of the prebiotic
      concept 15 years ago, it has become clear that products that cause a selective
      modification in the gut microbiota's composition and/or activity(ies) and thus
      strengthens normobiosis could either induce beneficial physiological effects in
      the colon and also in extra-intestinal compartments or contribute towards
      reducing the risk of dysbiosis and associated intestinal and systemic
      pathologies.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disease during which the
      pathophysiological role of the gut microbiota has been recently highlighted. In
      almost 20% of the patients, IBS is clearly a post-infectious IBS as a consequence
      of an acute bacterial gastroenteritis. Some papers have reported an abnormal
      colonic fermentation in IBS patients that could explain symptoms such as bloating
      and be one of the factors triggering visceral hypersensitivity. More recently,
      significant differences in the composition of both the luminal and
      mucosa-associated microbiota have been reported between both IBS patients and
      healthy controls and IBS subgroups while some arguments exist for a small
      intestinal overgrowth in a subset of IBS patients. All these arguments for a
      deleterious role of the gut microbiota lead to the actual discuss to consider new
      therapeutic options, including mainly pre- and probiotics and maybe antibiotics.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of Saccharomyces boulardii in adult patients.
PG  - 2202-22
AB  - This article reviews the evidence for efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces
      boulardii (S. boulardii) for various disease indications in adults based on the
      peer-reviewed, randomized clinical trials and pre-clinical studies from the
      published medical literature (Medline, Clinical Trial websites and meeting
      abstracts) between 1976 and 2009. For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded
      controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies,
      volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of
      efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31
      randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029
      study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe 
      in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic
      efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be
      strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea.
      Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of 
      enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori
      treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C.
      difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult
      diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related
      diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The 
      use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both
      efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.

TI  - VSL#3 improves symptoms in children with irritable bowel syndrome: a multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181ca4d95 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem
      in pediatrics, for which no safe and effective treatment is available. Probiotics
      have shown some promising results in adult studies, but no positive study has
      been published on pediatric age. We aimed at investigating the efficacy of VSL#3 
      in a population of children and teenagers affected by IBS, in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted in 7 pediatric
      gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Children 4 to 18 years of
      age, meeting eligibility criteria, were enrolled. The patients were assessed by a
      questionnaire for a 2-week baseline period. They were then randomized to receive 
      either VSL#3 or a placebo for 6 weeks, with controls every 2 weeks. At the end,
      after a "wash-out" period of 2 weeks, each patient was switched to the other
      group and followed for a further 6 weeks. RESULTS: : A total of 59 children
      completed the study. Although placebo was effective in some of the parameters and
      in as many as half of the patients, VSL#3 was significantly superior to it (P <
      0.05) in the primary endpoint, the subjective assessment of relief of symptoms;
      as well as in 3 of 4 secondary endpoints: abdominal pain/discomfort (P < 0.05),
      abdominal bloating/gassiness (P < 0.05), and family assessment of life disruption
      (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found (P = 0.06) in the stool pattern. 
      No untoward adverse effect was recorded in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: :
      VSL#3 is safe and more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms and
      improving the quality of life in children affected by IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the predictive values of the Prometheus
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology 7 (IBD7) panel (Prometheus
      Laboratories, San Diego, CA) with the predictive values of routine blood tests in
      a population of children referred for initial evaluation of suspected IBD.
      METHODS: Medical records of pediatric patients referred for evaluation of IBD for
      whom IBD7 testing was performed at Prometheus Laboratories between January 2006
      and November 2008 were reviewed. Patients underwent diagnosis by pediatric
      gastroenterologists on the basis of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and
      pathologic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 394 records were identified. We
      excluded 90 records on the basis of age of >21 years, previous diagnosis of IBD, 
      or unclear diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD in this cohort was 38%. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      and kappa value for the serological panel were 67%, 76%, 63%, 79%, and 42%,
      respectively, compared with values for a combination of 3 abnormal routine
      laboratory test results of 72%, 94%, 85%, 79%, and 47%. The antiflagellin
      antibody assay, the newest assay added to the panel, had sensitivity of 50% and
      specificity of 53%. Repeat serological testing failed to produce consistent
      results for 4 of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite its recent inclusion of the
      antiflagellin assay, the IBD7 panel has lower predictive values than routine
      laboratory tests in pediatric screening for IBD.

TI  - Treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics: the evidence.
PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1017/S002966511000011X [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of chronic abdominal pain, altered
      bowel habit and abdominal distension. It is the commonest cause of referral to
      gastroenterologists in the developed world and yet current therapeutic strategies
      are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in
      the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and IBS. Changes in faecal and
      mucosa-associated microbiota, post-infectious IBS, a link with small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth and an up-regulation of the GI mucosal immune system all
      suggest a role for the GI microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Given this
      evidence, therapeutic alteration of the GI microbiota by probiotic bacteria could
      be beneficial. The present paper establishes an aetiological framework for the
      use of probiotics in IBS and comprehensively reviews randomised
      placebo-controlled trials of probiotics in IBS using multiple electronic
      databases. It highlights safety concerns over the use of probiotics and attempts 
      to establish guidelines for their use in IBS in both primary and secondary care.

TI  - Potential benefits of probiotics--main findings of an in-depth review.
PG  - 110, 112, 114
AB  - Media reports on probiotics have been conflicting which has led to increased
      confusion among the general population and also among health professionals. To
      disentangle myths and reality, the British Nutrition Foundation has carried out a
      review on probiotics and health. There is good evidence that probiotics are
      effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and, although only few
      studies have been carried out so far, probiotic microorganisms also seem to have 
      the potential to prevent the potentially fatal Clostridium difficile-associated
      diarrhoea. A limited number of studies that are available on the effectiveness of
      probiotics on constipation have shown conflicting results, but promising results 
      have been found for certain strains. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms have been 
      found to be reduced by consuming probiotic strains, although a high placebo
      effect has been observed in some of the studies. The field of probiotics is
      relatively new and more studies will be needed to allow firm conclusions on the
      effectiveness of probiotic microorganisms for certain health issues.

TI  - Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics:
      probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the functional disorder
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 690S-7S
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.113746 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically
      mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains
      have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to
      be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems
      effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome 
      is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural
      abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted
      appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show
      positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect
      is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of
      inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.

TI  - Increased proteasome-mediated degradation of occludin in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 1181-8
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.700 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may contribute to the
      regulation of intestinal inflammation. At the same time, low-grade inflammation
      and increased intestinal permeability seem to be involved in the pathophysiology 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thus, we aimed to evaluate proteasome
      composition and activities in colonic mucosa of IBS patients and its putative
      pathogenic role. METHODS: Proteasome activities and proteasome subunit expression
      were measured in colonic mucosa of IBS, Crohn's disease (CD), and control
      patients by fluorometric assays and western blot, respectively. Expression of
      inhibitor of kappa B factor (IkappaB alpha) and occludin, a tight junction
      protein, was also evaluated in colonic biopsies. The degradation of recombinant
      occludin incubated with protein extracts from colonic mucosa was evaluated in the
      presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor, MG132. RESULTS: Proteasome
      trypsin-like activity was increased in IBS patients compared with CD and
      controls, whereas chymotrypsin-like activity was upregulated in CD patients only.
      Caspase-like activity was reduced both in IBS and CD patients. IkappaB alpha
      expression was similar between IBS and controls. In contrast, occludin expression
      was lower in IBS than in controls, but occludin mRNA level was similar. Protein
      extracts from IBS patients but not from controls degraded recombinant occludin
      (20% over 160 min), which was blocked by MG132. Although mast cell number was
      increased in IBS patients, no correlation was found between this number and
      proteasome alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that proteasome alterations 
      are present in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients and may contribute to the
      pathophysiology of IBS by increasing occludin degradation.

AB  - In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief 
      of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents,
      or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of
      dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary
      fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, 
      osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while
      loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of
      stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve
      symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower
      doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for 
      pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance
      to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin,
      metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical
      trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or
      lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic
      approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in 
      combination with pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Based on better recent knowledge of the factors involved in triggering visceral
      hyperalgesia, the therapeutic approach to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      treatment is changing. The classical approach targeting first bowel movement
      alterations or motility disorders using spasmolytic agents has to be replaced by 
      visceral antinociceptive drugs. Several mediators and receptors involved in gut
      hyperalgesia have already been identified. Serotonin (5-HT), tachykinins, CCK,
      NGF, and other mediators are involved in experimental models of gut hyperalgesia,
      and related receptor antagonists have already been introduced in clinical trials.
      However, IBS is associated with mucosal immune stimulation, considered a
      microinflammatory state associated with increased density of immunocytes and mast
      cells, offering new targets. Altered mucosal barrier permeability with increased 
      entry of toxins and bacteria is considered to be responsible for the mucosal
      microinflammation. Endogenous but predominantly luminal factors have been
      identified as factors responsible for such altered permeability. These clinical
      data have opened the door to promising future drugs able to prevent or blunt such
      permeability alteration, which therefore may constitute a pathophysiological
      treatment for IBS.

      microbial fermentation.
PG  - 124-30
LID - 10.1007/s10620-009-1026-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in children, a condition that accounts
      for approximately 25% of pediatric gastroenterology office visits, may be a
      precursor to irritable bowel syndrome in adults. Recently, small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been reported in 78-84% of IBS patients
      regardless of their abdominal symptoms, compared to 20% in healthy controls. Aims
      The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the prevalence of SIBO in
      children with CAP. METHODS: Seventy-five children aged 8-18 years diagnosed with 
      CAP based on the Rome II criteria and 40 healthy controls were enrolled. All
      subjects underwent a lactulose breath hydrogen test (LBT) to assess for SIBO.
      Children with CAP also filled out symptom questionnaires. RESULTS: There was a
      91% prevalence of an abnormal LBT suggestive of SIBO in the children with CAP and
      35% in controls (odds ratio = 16.7, 95% confidence interval 6.0-57.5, P <
      0.0001). A comparison of CAP children with a positive LBT to CAP children with a 
      negative LBT revealed the former had significantly more "urgency to have a bowel 
      movement" (P = 0.049) and experienced less "soiling" (P = 0.016) than those with 
      a negative LBT. No significant differences were found between the two groups in
      terms of the location of their pain or any other associated symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS: Similar to adults with IBS, there is a significantly higher
      prevalence of SIBO in children with CAP. Randomized controlled studies are needed
      to determine if eradication of SIBO will lead to symptom improvement in these
      patients.

TI  - Assessment of dietary intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 185-9
AB  - The dietary intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome was assessed using
      24-h dietary recall. The energy value and nutrient contents in the daily food
      rations were calculated by Nutritionist IV computer program with the Polish
      database. Differentiations in the Polish RDA coverage for energy and nutrients
      were observed in the studied group. Fat, saturated fatty acid, phosphorus and
      also vitamin A, E and C contents were above the RDA in the patients' daily food
      ration. The majority of IBS individuals did not meet recommendations for
      carbohydrate intake. Calcium and cooper intake was below the Polish RDA. The
      insufficient vitamin B2 intake and excessive Fe supply have been shown in the
      male patients.

TI  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection inhibits intestinal serotonin
      transporter function and expression.
PG  - 2074-83
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.09.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Serotonin transporter (SERT) plays a critical role in
      regulating serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) availability in the gut.
      Elevated 5-HT levels are associated with diarrheal conditions such as irritable
      bowel syndrome and enteric infections. Whether alteration in SERT activity
      contributes to the pathophysiology of diarrhea induced by the food-borne pathogen
      enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is not known. The present studies
      examined the effects of EPEC infection on SERT activity and expression in
      intestinal epithelial cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS:
      Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelia and EPEC-infected C57BL/6J 
      mouse model of infection were utilized. SERT activity was measured as Na(+) and
      Cl(-) dependent (3)[H] 5-HT uptake. SERT expression was measured by real-time
      quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting,
      and immunofluorescence studies. RESULTS: Infection of Caco-2 cells with EPEC for 
      30-120 minutes decreased apical SERT activity (P < .001) in a type 3 secretion
      system dependent manner and via involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases.
      EPEC infection decreased V(max) of the transporter; whereas cell surface
      biotinylation studies revealed no alteration in the cellular or plasma membrane
      content of SERT in Caco-2 cells. EPEC infection of mice (24 hours) reduced SERT
      immunostaining with a corresponding decrease in SERT messenger RNA levels, 5-HT
      uptake, and mucosal 5-HT content in the small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      demonstrate inhibition of SERT by EPEC and define the mechanisms underlying these
      effects. These data may aid in the development of a novel pharmacotherapy to
      modulate the serotonergic system in treatment of infectious diarrheal diseases.

PG  - 103-12
LID - 10.1007/s12519-009-0021-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is a common complaint in childhood and
      adolescence. Despite decades of clinical observations and research, it still
      poses a challenge to pediatric health care professionals. The aim of this review 
      is to highlight the epidemiology of pediatric chronic abdominal pain and to
      describe the pathogenesis of this disorder, its clinical manifestations,
      evaluation and therapeutic options. DATA SOURCES: Articles on chronic abdominal
      pain in the recent years from PubMed, MEDLINE, and reference textbooks were
      reviewed. RESULTS: Chronic abdominal pain, a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      (FGID), is a multifactorial condition that results from a complex interaction
      between psychosocial and physiologic factors via the brain-gut axis. A thorough
      history coupled with a complete physical examination and normal screening studies
      rule out an organic cause in 95% of the cases. It is highly important for the
      physician to establish a trusting relationship with the child and parents because
      successful treatment including modification of physical and psychological stress 
      factors, dietary changes, and drug therapy depends greatly on education,
      reassurance and active psychological support. CONCLUSIONS: FGIDs are a cause of
      great anxiety, distress and morbidity in children as well as adults. As our
      understanding of these conditions improves, our therapeutic interventions will
      progress not only to overcome them but also to intervene early in the disease
      course so as to limit long-term impact.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: from the gut to the brain-gut].
PG  - 703-12
LID - 10.1016/j.gcb.2009.07.006 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is not only a digestive motor disorder. It is a
      multifactorial disease for which many data have highlighted the
      pathophysiological importance of visceral hypersensitivity in the onset of
      symptoms, particularly abdominal pain. Hypersensitivity is due either to an
      afferent neurons disfunction at the enteric nervous system level, either to an
      abnormal brain-gut axis processing of sensory or nociceptive inputs arising from 
      the gut, at the spinal or supraspinal level. Disturbances of the autonomic
      nervous system occur in IBS as a consequence of this brain-gut axis dysfunction. 
      Neurological abnormalities may be triggered by inflammation, mast cell
      dysfunction or increased intestinal permeability while the neuro-immune
      consequences of stress (mainly chronic) play a major role in the genesis and the 
      maintenance of irritable bowel syndrome. The role of emotions and mood
      disturbances cannot be omitted in the interpretation the central processing of
      digestive sensory inputs. Neurosciences, in particular brain imaging techniques, 
      have contributed to this better understanding of irritable bowel syndrome
      pathophysiology. It is likely to play a major role in the future to improve our
      knowledge of the brain-gut axis function (mechanisms, neurotransmitters and
      receptors involved both in normal and pathological conditions). This knowledge is
      crucial because of the need for updated treatment strategies and new
      pharmacological and/or cognitive or behavioral therapies.

TI  - The effects of ageing on the colonic bacterial microflora in adults.
PG  - 653-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1109055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The composition of the fecal mircoflora and its changes on ageing
      have rarely been investigated in large samples of both patients and volunteers.
      METHODS: We analysed the fecal flora by conventional microbiological testing
      (Kyberstatus, Institute of Microecology, Herborn, Germany) of stool samples from 
      35 292 adults (age: 46.3 +/- 0.08 [18 to 96] years, 9564 males, 24 784 females;
      remaining = missing data) with different intestinal and non-intestinal diagnoses 
      for total colony-forming units (CFU) (per g stool) as well as relative abundance 
      of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and
      Lactobacillus spp. with respect to age, gender, and clinical data available (e.
      g., stool consistency and pH). RESULTS: The total CFU was stable and showed no
      age- or gender-related changes. Individual bacterial species constantly and
      significantly increased with age (E. coli, Enterococci spp.), or decreased at
      higher age (Bacteroides spp.), or were stable throughout the life span
      (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria). Gastrointestinal diagnoses (Crohn's disease, n = 
      198; ulcerative colitis, n = 515; irritable bowel syndrome, n = 7765; other GI
      diagnoses, n = 10 478) tended to exhibit some specificity of the bacterial
      profile, and when GI diagnoses were excluded, the age-related bacterial profile
      of the remaining group (n = 15 619, m:f = 4197:11 422) was not different.
      CONCLUSION: Conventional microbiological investigations of the fecal microbiota
      showed both bacteria-specific as well as a general pattern of ageing of the
      colonic microbiota, with the last decades (more than 60 years) demonstrating the 
      most profound changes. It remains to be shown whether these changes reflect
      direct changes of the gut microbiota, the mucosal innate immunity, or indirect
      consequences of age-related altered nutrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are no prospective, multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized pharmacologic trials for the treatment of
      pain-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders in children. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the efficacy of amitriptyline in children with
      pain-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: In this
      multicenter placebo-controlled trial, children with irritable bowel syndrome,
      functional abdominal pain, or functional dyspepsia were randomized to 4 weeks of 
      placebo or amitriptyline (10 mg/d, weight <35 kg; 20 mg/d, weight >35 kg).
      Assessment of gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological traits, and daily
      activities occurred before and after intervention. Pain was assessed daily with
      self-report diaries. The primary outcome was overall response to treatment
      (child's assessment of pain relief and sense of improvement). Secondary outcomes 
      were effect on psychosocial traits and daily functioning. RESULTS: Ninety
      children were enrolled, and 83 completed the study (placebo, 40 children [30
      girls]; drug, 43 children [35 girls]). A total of 63% of patients reported
      feeling better and 5% feeling worse in the amitriptyline arm compared with 57.5% 
      feeling better and 2.5% feeling worse in the placebo arm (P = .63). Pain relief
      was excellent in 7% and good in 38% of children receiving placebo compared with
      excellent in 15% and good in 35% of children treated with amitriptyline (P =
      .85). Logistic regression analysis of those reporting excellent or good response 
      versus fair, poor, or failed response showed no difference between amitriptyline 
      and placebo (P = .83). Children who had more severe pain at baseline in both
      groups (P = .0065) had worse outcome. Amitriptyline reduced anxiety scores (P <
      .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Both amitriptyline and placebo were associated with
      excellent therapeutic response. There was no significant difference between
      amitriptyline and placebo after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients with mild to
      moderate intensity of pain responded better to treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent, watery diarrhoea affects one-third of patients diagnosed
      with irritable bowel syndrome ('IBS-D'). Idiopathic bile acid malabsorption
      ('I-BAM') may be the cause. AIM: To determine the prevalence of I-BAM in patients
      suffering from IBS-D. METHODS: A systematic search was performed of publications 
      reporting patients presenting with IBS-D type symptoms, who were subsequently
      confirmed as having I-BAM by SeHCAT scanning. RESULTS: Eighteen relevant studies,
      15 prospective, comprising 1223 patients were identified. Five studies (429
      patients) indicated that 10% (CI: 7-13) patients had severe bile acid
      malabsorption (SeHCAT 7 day retention <5% of baseline value). 17 studies (1073
      patients) indicated that 32% (CI: 29-35) patients had moderate bile acid
      malabsorption (SeHCAT <10%). 7 studies (618 patients) indicated that 26% (CI:
      23-30) patients had mild (SeHCAT <15%) bile acid malabsorption. Pooled data from 
      15 studies showed a dose-response relationship according to severity of
      malabsorption to treatment with a bile acid binder: response to colestyramine
      occurred in 96% of patients with <5% retention, 80% at <10% retention and 70% at 
      <15% retention. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic adult-onset bile acid malabsorption is
      not rare. International guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome
      need to be revised so that clinicians become more aware of this possibility.

PG  - 764-7

AB  - Neonatal stress is a common early life event which alters the development of the 
      endocrine and immune systems. Specifically, exposure to neonatal stress results
      in alterations to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in
      offspring who hyper-respond to stress in adulthood. Recently, this concept has
      been applied to the ontogeny of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances
      such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The high prevalence of this disorder and 
      the ineffectiveness of current treatments results in high direct and indirect
      costs to the society. Recently, administration of probiotics to neonates has been
      used as a safe and cost-effective preventative strategy to revoke the long term
      unfavourable imprinting induced on the gastrointestinal system by early life
      stressors in animal models of human IBS. It is not as yet known however, whether 
      maternal supplementary probiotics may also contribute to improved GI integrity
      and gut-associated immune functioning in stressed neonates, if these possible
      improvements persist into adulthood, or how this protective effect may be
      mediated. Our hypothesis is an attempt to link this proposed nutritional approach
      and its possible preventive effects against GI dysfunctions provoked by neonatal 
      stress.

PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.1016/j.pain.2009.04.017 [doi]
AB  - Elevated colonic luminal serine-protease (Ser-P) activity of diarrhea-predominant
      IBS (IBS-D) patients evokes a proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2-mediated
      colonic hypersensitivity in mice. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P levels in
      feces, patients with IBD exhibit visceral hypo- or normosensitivity to rectal
      distension, as opposed to IBS-D. To explain these discrepancies we studied the
      effect of colonic infusion of fecal supernatants from ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients to colorectal mechanical sensitivity of mice and explored the
      involvement of PAR-4 and its activator Cathepsin-G (Cat-G). Fecal protease
      activities were assayed in healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients in presence or
      not of antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. Following intracolonic infusion of fecal
      supernatants from healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients or PAR-4 activating
      peptide (PAR-4-AP) or Cat-G, EMG response to colorectal balloon distension was
      recorded in mice. This nociceptive response was also determined after treatment
      with pepducin (PAR-4 antagonist) on UC supernatant or after a preincubation with 
      antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. In contrast to IBS-D supernatant, UC
      supernatant promoted colonic hyposensitivity to distension, an effect mimicked by
      PAR-4-AP or Cat-G. UC supernatant-induced hypoalgesia was inhibited by a cocktail
      of antiproteases. However, blockade of PAR-4 or Cat-G inhibition resulted in
      colonic hypersensitivity similar to that observed after IBS-D supernatant
      infusion. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P activities, IBS-D and UC fecal
      supernatant display visceral pro- and antinociceptive effects in mice,
      respectively. Visceral hyposensitivity induced by fecal supernatant from UC
      patients results from PAR-4 activation by cathepsin-G, counterbalancing the
      pronociceptive effect of simultaneous PAR-2 activation.

      some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation,
      the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear 
      less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of
      diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition.
      Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults,
      but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious
      outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are
      less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic
      supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk
      and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early
      supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from
      studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans
      is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects
      seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of
      probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the
      subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements 
      were made.

AB  - The normal microbiota and man form a superorganism, in which only 10% are human
      cells. The skin and mucous membranes support 10(14) living microbes, mainly at
      the end of the gastrointestinal tract, forming a 1.5-kg cell mass ecosystem
      mainly consisting of bacteria. Investigations of the intestinal microbiota have
      yielded an estimated biodiversity of 1200-16000 bacterial phylotypes. They are
      known to affect physiology, development of immune defense, colonization
      resistance and nutrition. Changes in microbial population can be associated with 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, obesity
      and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), frequently associated with psychological
      distress, is characterized by hypersensitivity to gut wall distension. Some
      probiotics are able to alleviate IBS symptoms and reduce visceromotor response to
      mechanical stimuli in animals. Moreover, we have previously shown that
      Lactobacillus farciminis treatment abolished the hyperalgesia to colorectal
      distension (CRD) induced by acute stress. The aims of the present study were to
      determine whether (i) stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia modifies the
      expression of Fos, a marker of general neuronal activation, induced by CRD, (ii) 
      this activation can be modulated by L. farciminis treatment. Female rats were
      treated by L. farciminis and CRD was performed after partial restraint stress
      (PRS) or sham-PRS. The expression of Fos protein was measured by
      immunohistochemistry. After CRD or PRS, Fos expression was increased in spinal
      cord section (S1), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), paraventricular nucleus
      (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA). The
      combination of both stimuli, PRS and CRD, markedly increased this Fos
      overexpression in the sacral spinal cord section, PVN and MeA, but not in NTS. By
      contrast, a pretreatment with L. farciminis significantly reduced the number of
      Fos positive cells in these area. This study shows that PRS enhances Fos protein 
      expression induced by CRD at the spinal and supraspinal levels in rats.
      Lactobacillus farciminis treatment inhibited this enhancing effect, suggesting
      that the antinociceptive effect of this probiotic strain results from a decrease 
      of the stress-induced activation/sensitization of sensory neurons at the spinal
      and supraspinal level.

TI  - Effect of the consumption of a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium
      lactis DN-173 010 on constipation in childhood: a multicentre randomised
      controlled trial (NTRTC: 1571).
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-9-22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frustrating symptom affecting 3% of children
      worldwide. Randomised controlled trials show that both polyethylene glycol and
      lactulose are effective in increasing defecation frequency in children with
      constipation. However, in 30-50%, these children reported abdominal pain,
      bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea and bad taste of the medication. Two
      recent studies have shown that the fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool
      frequency in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients with a
      defecation frequency < 3/week and in constipated women with a defecation
      frequency < 3/week. Goal of this study is to determine whether this fermented
      dairy product is effective in the treatment of constipated children with a
      defecation frequency < 3/week. METHODS/DESIGN: It is a two nation (The
      Netherlands and Poland) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised multicentre
      trial in which 160 constipated children (age 3-16 years) with a defecation
      frequency <3/week will be randomly allocated to consume a fermented dairy product
      containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 or a control product, twice a day,
      for 3 weeks. During the study all children are instructed to try to defecate on
      the toilet for 5-10 minutes after each meal (3 times a day) and daily complete a 
      standardized bowel diary. Primary endpoint is stool frequency. Secondary
      endpoints are stool consistency, faecal incontinence frequency, pain during
      defecation, digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, flatulence), adverse effects
      (nausea, diarrhoea, bad taste) and intake of rescue medication (Bisacodyl). Rate 
      of success and rate of responders are also evaluated, with success defined as >
      or = 3 bowel movements per week and < or =1 faecal incontinence episode over the 
      last 2 weeks of product consumption and responder defined as a subject reporting 
      a stool frequency > or = 3 on the last week of product consumption. To
      demonstrate that the success percentage in the intervention group will be 35% and
      the success percentage in the control group (acidified milk without ferments,
      toilet training, bowel diary) will be 15%, with alpha 0.05 and power 80%, a total
      sample size of 160 patients was calculated. CONCLUSION: This study is aimed to
      show that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain
      DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency after 3 weeks of product
      consumption in children with functional constipation and a defecation frequency <
      3/week.

AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms that produce a benefit to the host when
      provided in adequate amounts from food or supplements. There is an increased
      interest in the use of probiotics in the management and treatment of complex
      medical conditions. Recommendations for probiotic supplementation in the
      pediatric population are often conflicting due to limited research in many
      pediatric disease states. Research on single and multistrain probiotics has shown
      promise for some pediatric populations. This review discusses the research
      available for probiotic supplementation for children with irritable bowel
      syndrome, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency
      virus, and food allergies. Probiotic safety also is discussed.

TI  - The impact of probiotic on gut health.
PG  - 68-78
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota plays an important role in host
      health due to its involvement in nutritional, immunologic and physiological
      functions. Microbial imbalances have been associated with enhanced risk of
      specific diseases. This observation has allowed the introduction of
      microorganisms as probiotics which are microbes with demonstrated health benefits
      in humans when ingested in foods. The mechanisms of action include the inhibition
      of pathogen growth by competition for nutritional sources and adhesion sites,
      secretion of antimicrobial substances, toxin inactivation. Consequently, the
      primary clinical interest in the application of probiotics has been in the
      prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea diseases. The well-characterized immunomodulatory potential of specific 
      probiotic strains, beyond the effect on the composition of the microbiota, has
      been be used as innovative tools to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize 
      gut mucosal dysfunction, and down-regulate hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical
      efficacy of specific probiotic strains has been demonstrated in, rotavirus's
      diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and food
      allergies. Further, recent clinical and nutritional studies have uncovered the
      function of specific strains in energy metabolism and thereby have opened up new 
      angles on their exploitation. However, as these processes are highly specific, it
      is important to characterize the properties of specific probiotic strains an in
      order to select the best strains or strain combinations for the target in
      question. Advances have prompted increased the interest of researchers and
      industry and new applications and targets are being discovered.

PG  - 633-58

AB  - Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through
      resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon
      intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial
      members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal
      microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial
      effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory
      processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and
      evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory
      animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and 
      the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies
      in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system
      may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of
      intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten
      trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious
      outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in 
      specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in
      animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal
      inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but
      findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the
      results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of
      immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain
      intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To
      investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms
      of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS.
      METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria,
      participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising
      two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB
      30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum
      CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8
      weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly
      during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A
      significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in
      scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was 
      observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the
      probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain
      probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.
