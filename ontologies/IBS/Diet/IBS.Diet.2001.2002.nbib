TI  - Role of food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 403-12
AB  - A significant proportion of IBS patients attribute their symptoms to adverse food
      reactions. Dietary elimination and re-challenge studies support the role of diet 
      in the pathogenesis of IBS. The aetiopathogenesis of IBS is thought to be
      multifactorial involving an interaction between diet, infection, antibiotics and 
      psychosocial factors. Serum IgE and IgG4 antibodies are elevated in food
      hypersensitivity induced atopic conditions and a similar mechanism has been
      postulated in IBS. Increased number of mast cells is present in the ileocaecal
      region of IBS patients. Once sensitized, they are capable of inducing secretory
      and sensorimotor abnormalities of the gut. The management of IBS is usually aimed
      at controlling symptoms, however, evaluation of food hypersensitivity may provide
      a useful adjunct in those with severe symptoms or a clear history of adverse food
      reaction. There are no well-established tests available but skin prick tests and 
      food specific serum IgG4 and IgE antibodies may help in identifying the offending
      foods. Other options, which may be explored in individual cases, include
      sequential dietary exclusion, use of hypoallergenic diets, disodium cromoglycate 
      and novel techniques such as colonoscopic allergen provocation test.
      Pathophysiology of hypersensitivity induced IBS has been discussed in the light
      of current data and a management algorithm has been proposed for managing food
      hypersensitivity in IBS.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a little understood organic bowel disease?
PG  - 555-64
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome affects 10% of adults with an unexplained female
      predominance. Although only a few people see their family doctor, the disease
      causes reduced quality of life and represents a multi-billion pound health-care
      problem. The disorder clusters in families, which is possibly because of
      intra-familial learning and a genetic predisposition. Visceral hypersensitivity
      is a key feature in most patients. Results of imaging studies of regional
      cerebral blood flow during rectal distension suggest underlying disturbances of
      central processing of afferent signals, though this is not unique to the
      disorder, since it is seen in other chronic pain syndromes. Environmental factors
      that are strongly implicated in at least some patients include gastrointestinal
      infection and inflammation and chronic stress. Diagnosis is based on positive
      symptoms and absence of any alarm indicators. Treatment remains unsatisfactory
      and hinges on an excellent doctor-patient relationship, with drugs for symptom
      exacerbations. Cognitive behavioural treatment, psychotherapy, and hypnosis could
      provide long-lasting benefit in some patients. Tricyclic antidepressants in low
      doses seem to be the most effective class of drugs for the disorder on the basis 
      of limited data.

TI  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis.
PG  - 366-72
AB  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare gastrointestinal (GI) disorder of
      undetermined cause characterized by infiltration of eosinophils in the GI tract. 
      Eosinophils accumulate in tissues and may release highly cytotoxic granular
      proteins, which cause severe tissue damage characteristic of eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis. Eotaxin may play a role in the recruitment of eosinophils into
      tissue in combination with chemoattractants and cytokines, including interleukin 
      3 and 5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Food allergy,
      especially in children, can be a triggering factor, and an amino acid-based diet 
      may be helpful. Accumulation of eosinophils in the gut is a common feature in
      food-induced GI disorders that can be regulated through a complex molecular
      network involving Th2 cells, various cytokines, and chemokines. Eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation depending on the
      site of involvement. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome or
      dyspepsia and, rarely, mimics pancreatitis or appendicitis. Diagnosis is
      important and is usually made by a pathologist. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a
      treatable disease; patients generally respond to steroid therapy, although
      relapse is common. Non-enteric-coated budesonide, a locally acting corticosteroid
      with little risk of adrenal suppression, may be substituted, although more
      experience is needed. Promising new drugs for eosinophilic gastroenteritis
      include montelukast, a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, and suplaplast 
      tosilate, a selective Th2 cytokine inhibitor with inhibitory effects on
      allergy-induced eosinophilic infiltration and IgE production. Although it is
      likely a separate disease, more experience has accumulated, and an elimination or
      specific amino acid-based diet appears to be helpful in treatment.

TI  - Probiotics and intestinal health effects: a clinical perspective.
PG  - S51-7
AB  - Probiotics are viable non-pathogenic micro-organisms which, when ingested, exert 
      a positive influence on host health or physiology. We have critically analysed
      the evidence for the efficacy of specific probiotic strains in human
      gastrointestinal diseases. The best evidence can be obtained with randomised
      controlled trials which avoid bias. Good evidence has been obtained with several 
      strains in the prevention or treatment of antibiotic-associated disorders, in the
      treatment (and to a lesser extent prevention) of gastroenteritis and acute
      diarrhoea and in the alleviation of lactose intolerance. We also analysed the
      recent randomised controlled trials performed in patients with Clostridium
      difficile or Helicobacter pylori, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia and colon cancer.

TI  - A review of the role of the gut microflora in irritable bowel syndrome and the
      effects of probiotics.
PG  - S67-72
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multi-factorial gastrointestinal condition
      affecting 8-22 % of the population with a higher prevalence in women and
      accounting for 20-50 % of referrals to gastroenterology clinics. It is
      characterised by abdominal pain, excessive flatus, variable bowel habit and
      abdominal bloating for which there is no evidence of detectable organic disease. 
      Suggested aetiologies include gut motility and psychological disorders,
      psychophysiological phenomena and colonic malfermentation. The faecal microflora 
      in IBS has been shown to be abnormal with higher numbers of facultative organisms
      and low numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Although there is no evidence
      of food allergy in IBS, food intolerance has been identified and exclusion diets 
      are beneficial to many IBS patients. Food intolerance may be due to abnormal
      fermentation of food residues in the colon, as a result of disruption of the
      normal flora. The role of probiotics in IBS has not been clearly defined. Some
      studies have shown improvements in pain and flatulence in response to probiotic
      administration, whilst others have shown no symptomatic improvement. It is
      possible that the future role of probiotics in IBS will lie in prevention, rather
      than cure.

TI  - Probiotics as modulators of the gut flora.
PG  - S39-49
AB  - Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining 
      the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'.
      Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and
      disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the
      approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be
      the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most
      efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh
      physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes 
      gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A
      survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials,
      with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In
      theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against
      common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of
      acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites,
      immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such,
      persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic
      intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can
      help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for
      genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as
      effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome.
      The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance
      for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target
      groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the
      elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial
      microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions
      involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival
      issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem
      should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful
      probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate
      selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics 
      are known as synbiotics.

TI  - Etiology of nonresponsive celiac disease: results of a systematic approach.
PG  - 2016-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nonresponse or relapse of symptoms is common in patients with celiac 
      disease treated with gluten free diet. Refractory sprue (RS) is defined as
      initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet to restore normal
      intestinal architecture and function in patients who have celiac-like
      enteropathy. The aims of this study were: 1) to identify causes of persistent
      symptoms in patients referred with presumed diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac
      disease (NCD); and 2) to characterize patients with true RS. METHODS: Patients
      were identified who had been systematically evaluated for NCD between January
      1997, and May 2001. Patient records and small bowel biopsy results were reviewed.
      RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were referred with a presumed diagnosis of NCD.
      Six did not have celiac disease and had other diseases responsible for their
      symptoms. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common reasons 
      for evaluation in cases of NCD, whereas weight loss, steatorrhea, and diarrhea
      were the most common presenting features of RS (nine patients). Of the 49
      patients with celiac disease, 25 were identified as having gluten contamination. 
      Additional diagnoses accounting for persistent symptoms included: pancreatic
      insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic
      colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, T-cell lymphoma, pancreatic
      cancer, fructose intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, cavitating
      lymphadenopathy syndrome, and tropical sprue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study,
      we conclude the following: 1) gluten contamination is the leading reason for NCD;
      2) of NCD cases, 18% are due to RS; and 3) alternative diseases or those
      coexistent with celiac disease and gluten contamination should be ruled out
      before a diagnosis of RS is made.

TI  - High-fiber diet supplementation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): 
      a multicenter, randomized, open trial comparison between wheat bran diet and
      partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG).
PG  - 1697-704
AB  - High-fiber diet supplementation is commonly used in IBS, although it poses
      several management problems. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) has shown
      beneficial effects in animal and human studies, but its potential role in IBS
      symptom relief has not been evaluated yet. We investigated PHGG in IBS patients
      and compared it to a wheat bran diet. Abdominal pain, bowel habits, and
      subjective overall rating were longitudinally evaluated in 188 adult IBS patients
      (139 women and 49 men) for 12 weeks. Patients were classified as having
      diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or changeable bowel habits and
      were randomly assigned to groups receiving fiber (30 g/day of wheat bran) or PHGG
      (5 g/day). After four weeks, patients were allowed to switch group, depending on 
      their subjective evaluation of their symptoms. Significantly more patients
      switched from fiber to PHGG (49.9%) than from PHGG to fiber (10.9%) at four
      weeks. Per protocol analysis showed that both fiber and PHGG were effective in
      improving pain and bowel habits, but no difference was found between the two
      groups. Conversely, intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater
      success in the PHGG group (60%) than in the fiber group (40%). Moreover,
      significantly more patients in the PHGG group reported a greater subjective
      improvement than those in the Fiber group. In conclusion, improvements in core
      IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bowel habits) were observed with both bran and
      PHGG, but the latter was better tolerated and preferred by patients, revealing a 
      higher probability of success than bran and a lower probability of patients
      abandoning the prescribed regimen, suggesting that it can increase the benefits
      deriving from fiber intake in IBS, making it a valid option to consider for
      high-fiber diet supplementation.

TI  - Diet in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - S45-52
AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often request dietary
      recommendations. They must eat, and they want to know what to eat. Present
      national guidelines recommend dietary treatment with fiber for IBS patients with 
      constipation. Diet recommendations are made based on symptoms. There may be
      different dietary recommendations for constipation, diarrhea, and pain or
      bloating. This article reviews the relationship of foods to IBS and issues of
      food intolerances and hypersensitivities, and recommendations for diet therapy.
      The role of dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble, is reviewed. Although
      there are few studies to substantiate exact diets, broad dietary plans are
      recommended for the different symptoms of IBS. In addition, the recent literature
      on probiotics and prebiotics pertinent to IBS is reviewed.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: basis of clinical management strategies.
PG  - S37-44
AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often described as challenging. 
      The diagnosis of IBS can safely be made using the Rome II criteria in conjunction
      with a thorough physical examination and a limited number of diagnostic studies. 
      Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the
      pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both
      patient and physician alike. Important areas of research focus on the psychology 
      of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g., heightened
      gastrocolonic response), and the "brain-gut axis." A multidisciplinary effort is 
      often required to ameliorate symptoms and improve the patients' quality of life. 
      This review article will discuss the myriad of treatments available for patients 
      with IBS, and provide both a clinical and practical discussion of their use,
      providing evidence where available and clinical experience where it is not.

TI  - The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1395-406
AB  - The efforts of clinical researchers, lay organizations and pharmaceutical
      companies have increased the public profile of irritable bowel syndrome and made 
      it a respectable diagnosis. Diagnostic symptom criteria encourage a firm clinical
      diagnosis, which is the foundation of a logical management strategy. This begins 
      with education. Reassurance that no structural disease threatens should be
      tempered with the reality that symptoms are likely to recur over many years.
      Patients expect diet and lifestyle advice, even if this is not specific to
      irritable bowel syndrome. Only a few of those with irritable bowel syndrome see
      doctors, and even fewer see specialists. Therefore, the treating physician should
      ascertain the reason for the visit, the patient's fears and the presence of any
      comorbid illness, such as depression, that might require treatment in its own
      right. No drug treatment is useful for all of the symptoms of irritable bowel
      syndrome, and many patients require no drug at all. If used, drugs should target 
      the predominant symptom. Alosetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, is effective in treating 
      women with irritable bowel syndrome who also have diarrhoea. Tegaserod, a 5-HT4
      agonist, is useful for women with irritable bowel syndrome who are constipated.
      Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome need psychological support.
      Reassurance, discussion and relaxation techniques can be provided by the family
      doctor. Difficult psychopathology may require referral to a mental health
      professional, and the gastroenterologist can settle diagnostic uncertainties. In 
      all cases, successful treatment depends on a confident diagnosis and the strength
      of the doctor-patient relationship.

TI  - Evaluation of hydrogen excretion after lactulose administration as a screening
      test for causes of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 753-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether it is possible to separate cases of irritable
      bowel syndrome associated with excess total hydrogen production (as a surrogate
      of colonic fermentation; these patients may be offered an exclusion diet as
      treatment) from other causes of irritable bowel syndrome by determining the
      amount of hydrogen excreted on patients' breath after oral administration of
      lactulose. DESIGN: Comparison of 24-hour hydrogen excretion and breath hydrogen
      following lactulose in untreated patients fulfilling the Rome criteria for
      irritable bowel syndrome, normal controls and irritable bowel syndrome patients
      who had previously failed to improve on an exclusion diet. METHODS: Colonic
      fermentation was measured by indirect calorimetry over 24 h. Immediately after
      calorimetry, the patients who were fasting received 20 g lactulose;
      end-expiratory breath samples were then collected every 30 min for 3 h. Hydrogen 
      concentrations were determined by an electro-chemical cell. RESULTS: The total
      24-hour excretion of hydrogen was significantly greater in the irritable bowel
      syndrome group (median 333.7 ml/24 h, interquartile range 234.7-445.67) compared 
      to the normal volunteers (median 203.1 ml/24 h, interquartile range 131.4-256; P 
      = 0.002) or the failed-diet group (median 204.5 ml/24 h, interquartile range
      111.35-289.13; P = 0.015). No difference was detected in breath excretion of
      hydrogen following lactulose in any group. CONCLUSION: Total hydrogen production 
      over 24 h is increased in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome who may
      respond to exclusion diets. However, this sub-group of patients cannot be
      identified by measuring breath-hydrogen excretion after lactulose.

TI  - [Implications of fiber in different pathologies].
PG  - 17-29
AB  - Three decades ago, the observations of Trowell and Burkitt gave rise to the
      "fibre theory", in which it was contended that there was a link between the
      consumption of a diet rich in fibre and non-processed carbohydrates and the level
      of protection against many of the "first world diseases" such as constipation,
      diverticulosis, cancer of the colon, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular
      disease. Since that time, numerous studies have been presented to analyze the
      relationship between fibre and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and other 
      processes with severe health implications. The present revision looks at the
      experience accumulated over this period regarding the importance of the
      consumption of fibre for certain phatologies. It not only deals with the
      epidemiological relationship existing between fibre intake and the development of
      diseases such as cancer of the colon or cardiovascular disorders but also reviews
      the interest of fibre a therapeutic agent, in view of the current information
      available on its different mechanism of action. Thus the possibility of using
      soluble fibre has taken on renewed interest for the treatment of inflammatory
      intestinal disease, for control of diarrhoea, in irritable bowel syndrome or no
      modulate the concentrations of glycaemia or cholesterol. Three is a discussion of
      the discrepancies found between the consumption of fibre and diverticular
      disease, the treatment of constipation and the association with obesity and
      cardiovascular disease. Despite the accumulated evidence on the consumption of
      fibre, there is currently no consensus as to recommendations on what type of
      fibre and the optimal amount that should be consumed. A high fibre intake (>
      25-30 g/day) based on a variety of food sources (fruit, vegetable, legumes,
      cereals) is the only way to avoid many of the disorders mentioned. The
      consumption of a particular type of fibre (soluble or insoluble) is limited to
      the treatment of certain processes, because its individual relationship with many
      disorders is still pending determination.

PG  - 187-98
AB  - Tegaserod, a potent, partial serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4) agonist, is an
      effective agent for the treatment of females with constipation-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome. Tegaserod enhances gastric motility, stimulates
      peristaltic reflux and intestinal secretion, inhibits visceral sensitivity,
      and/or shortens colonic transit time. This agent may help women who have failed
      to respond to diet and exercise, laxatives, and other forms of therapy. The
      optimal dose of tegaserod is 6 mg twice daily and results in decreased number of 
      days per month with pain, bloating, and days without bowel movements. Tegaserod
      is less effective in males than females in the treatment of
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Tegaserod is well tolerated.
      Diarrhea is the most frequent adverse effect. The diarrhea tends to occur most
      frequently during the first few months of therapy and decreases with continued
      administration.

TI  - Celiac disease and irritable bowel-type symptoms.
PG  - 1463-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have linked irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      etiologically with various forms of mucosal inflammation, including infectious
      enterocolitides and inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanism is uncertain but
      may involve sensitization by inflammatory mediators. The enteropathy of celiac
      disease has theoretical advantages as a study model because it can be controlled 
      with dietary gluten exclusion; however, whether it also predisposes to functional
      bowel disorders is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of IBS-type
      symptoms in adult celiac patients and correlated this with dietary compliance
      with gluten exclusion. METHODS: Adult patients (n = 150; 106 women and 44 men)
      with confirmed celiac disease were randomly selected from a computerized database
      of >350 patients, and were asked to complete a bowel questionnaire and the Short 
      Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). The control group (n = 162; 133 women and 29 men) 
      had no history of celiac disease and had similar mean age and sex profile.
      RESULTS: Of 150 celiac patients reviewed, 30 of 150 (20%) fulfilled the Rome
      criteria compared with eight of 162 (5%) ontrols. Of the celiac patients 10 of 46
      (22%) had partial or no compliance with a gluten-free diet, whereas 20 of 104
      patients (19%) adhered to the diet; this difference did not achieve statistical
      significance. Celiac patients with IBS-type symptoms had a markedly lower quality
      of life than those without, all eight domains being impaired to a clinically
      significant extent. Dietary gluten exclusion improved QOL in four of eight scales
      measured. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that mucosal inflammation in celiac disease
      may have a sensitizing effect or may predispose to IBS-type symptoms is supported
      by these results. Failure to attain optimal subjective well-being is common in
      celiac patients, particularly in those with coexisting IBS. Compliance with a
      gluten-free diet confers some benefit.

TI  - Compliance, tone and sensitivity of the rectum in different subtypes of irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) consists of various subtypes. It is not known
      whether these subtypes share a common pathophysiology. Evaluation of motor and
      sensory function of the rectum using a barostat may help to explore a common
      pathophysiological background or differences in pathophysiology in subtypes of
      IBS. We have evaluated compliance, tone and sensitivity of the rectum, in both
      fasting state and postprandially, using a computerized barostat in 15 patients
      with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 14 patients with constipation-predominant
      IBS (IBS-C) and compared the results with those obtained in 12 healthy controls. 
      Rectal compliance as calculated over the steep part of the pressure-volume curve 
      (17-23 mmHg) was decreased in both IBS groups (IBS-D 8.0 +/- 1.4 mL mmHg-1; IBS-C
      5.6 +/- 1.1 mL mmHg-1) compared with controls (24.7 +/- 3.5 mL mmHg-1). The
      perception of urge was increased only in IBS-D patients, whereas pain perception 
      was significantly increased in both IBS groups. Spontaneous adaptive relaxation
      was decreased in IBS-D patients. Postprandially, rectal volume decreased
      significantly in the controls and in IBS-D patients, but not in IBS-C patients.
      In conclusion, both rectal motor and sensory characteristics are different
      between IBS-D and IBS-C patients. Therefore, testing of rectal visceroperception,
      adaptive relaxation and the rectal response to a meal may help distinguish groups
      of patients with different subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and nonspecific diarrhea in infancy and
      childhood--relationship with juice carbohydrate malabsorption.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Lactose intolerance and malabsorbed carbohydrate present in some fruitjuice may
      trigger symptoms commonly seen in irritable bowel syndrome. In a two-site study, 
      28 subjects 9 months to 18 years old (mean 6.9 +/- 5.9 years) with significant
      intake of apple juice or pear nectar (> 6 oz a day) with the diagnoses of
      irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, or chronic nonspecific
      diarrhea were recruited. Breath hydrogen tolerance tests utilizing lactose,
      sucrose, and apple juice in the amount they typically consumed were positive in
      32%, 0%, and 50%, respectively. Subjects were asked to refrain from the ingestion
      ofjuice for 1 month: 13 of the 28 (46%) subjects improved while 15 (54%) showed
      no change in their symptoms. In fact, none consuming 6 to 12 oz of apple or pear 
      juice daily improved, 27% of those consuming 12 to 16 oz improved, and 91% of
      those consuming > 16 oz improved (P < 0.02). Subjects were then given comparable 
      amounts of white grape juice for 1 year. The initial symptoms did not recur in
      any of the subjects who initially responded to the juice-free diet. Of the 15
      subjects who did not respond to the juice-free diet, seven became asymptomatic.
      Overall, 20 subjects (71%) were asymptomatic, and eight (29%) had no change in
      their symptoms. Some individuals with irritable bowel syndrome have their
      symptoms based on their malabsorption of carbohydrates present in apple juice and
      pear nectar and may improve with adequate choices of fruit juice such as changing
      to white grape juice.

TI  - Chronic fatigue syndrome: evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 1083-90
AB  - Severe fatigue is a common complaint among patients. Often, the fatigue is
      transient or can be attributed to a definable organic illness. Some patients
      present with persistent and disabling fatigue, but show no abnormalities on
      physical examination or screening laboratory tests. In these cases, the diagnosis
      of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by
      debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias,
      chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is
      primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings.
      Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS 
      (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains
      elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an
      interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and
      concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and
      headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to 
      each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene,
      antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.

TI  - [Physicochemical and pharmacological characteristic and clinical efficacy of an
      anti-irritable bowel syndrome agent, polycarbophil calcium (Polyful)].
PG  - 185-90
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by
      abdominal pain or discomfort and abnormal defecation. Polycarbophil calcium, a
      water-absorbing polymer, is expected to improve stool consistency. Polycarbophil 
      calcium decalcified under the acidic condition and then absorbed 70 times its
      weight of water under the neutral condition. In in situ experiments using rat
      jejunum and colon, polycarbophil decreased water absorption by the intestine
      without affecting water secretion. Polycarbophil inhibited prostaglandin E2-,
      5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan- and castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice or rats.
      Polycarbophil calcium also inhibited sennoside-induced diarrhea in dogs.
      Polycarbophil increased the weight of feces in naive or low-fiber diet feeding
      rats. In naive dogs, polycarbophil calcium increased stool frequency, stool
      weight and moisture. Polycarbophil was not absorbed from the gastrointestine, not
      metabolized and eliminated into feces in rats and dogs. Polycarbophil calcium did
      not affect the absorption of coadministered drugs in dogs. In the dose-finding
      clinical study for IBS, polycarbophil calcium was effective both in diarrhea and 
      constipation. In the Phase III study, polycarbophil calcium was superior to
      trimebutine maleate in efficacy and equal in safety. Emesis/vomiting and thirst
      were observed, but episodes of diarrhea or constipation by excessive action were 
      few. Polycarbophil calcium seems promising as an anti-IBS agent.

TI  - Distal colonic motor activity in four subgroups of patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome.
PG  - 345-55
AB  - With the aim of improving end organ treatment, we describe a new system of
      classifying irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) according to clinical features into
      four groups, spastic colon syndrome (SCS), functional diarrhea (FD),
      diarrhea-predominant spastic colon syndrome (DPSCS), and midgut dysmotility
      (MGD). The aim of the study was to investigate fasting and postprandial distal
      colonic motility in the four groups of patients and to compare the results with
      normal controls. Distal colonic motility studies were performed in the unprepared
      colon. 2.5-hr recordings were made from four channels with a standard meal
      administered at 0.5 hr. The intubated colon was treated as a study segment and
      data analyzed for study segment activity index (SSAI) and number and mean
      amplitude of pressure peaks over 30-min epochs. Patients with SCS had
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean amplitude of pressure peaks (60 min, 120
      min) and SSAI (120 min) than controls and patients with FD, DPSCS, and MGD. In
      contrast, patients with FD and DPSCS had significantly (P < 0.05) lower
      postprandial SSAI than controls and patients with SCS (60 min, 120 min). With the
      exception of raised postprandial mean amplitude of pressure peaks (120 min), MGD 
      patients had normal distal colonic motility. Division of IBS patients into
      subgroups has highlighted significant differences in distal colonic motility that
      provide insights into etiopathogenesis and should assist targeting of current and
      newly developed therapies, particularly receptor active agents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk factors in the pathogenicity of irritable bouel
      syndrome(IBS) in Zhanjiang city. METHODS: Two hundred and seven IBS patients were
      randomly selected and compared with "healthy" people diagnosed in the same
      hospital during the same period. Roles of major risk factors to IBS were studied 
      through using a case-control study. RESULTS: Family history of hysteria or mental
      disease and vegetorsis was closely related to IBS, with ORs 3 and 4 respectively.
      There was alse close relationship between IBS and psychic trauma, often taking
      antibiotics, tension at work and eating sweet potato or cassava, with ORs between
      1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Our investigation suggested that the six major risk factors 
      mentioned above played important roles in the progression of IBS in Zhanjiang
      city.

TI  - Diet triggers symptoms in women with irritable bowel syndrome. The patient's
      perspective.
PG  - 246-52
AB  - The purpose of this phenomenological analysis was to describe perceptions of
      women with irritable bowel syndrome regarding the relationship of diet to their
      symptoms. Thirty-five women ages 18-45 with a medical diagnosis of irritable
      bowel syndrome or symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of irritable bowel
      syndrome were interviewed and completed questionnaires as part of a larger study.
      During the interview, the women were asked what they thought caused their
      symptoms. Overall, women tried to adjust their diet to achieve a "Range of
      Comfort" so their symptoms were tolerable or manageable. To do this, women used a
      process of "Trial and Error." If a link could be made to diet, then women
      developed "Self-care Strategies" to maintain a "Healthy Diet." Women who failed
      to find a relationship during the "Trial and Error" process either felt the
      frustration of "Uncertainty" or, for a few women, decided that adjusting their
      diet was not worth the bother. This study suggests diet and eating behaviors are 
      an important starting point for many women as they try to manage their irritable 
      bowel syndrome symptoms.

TI  - Update in the therapeutic management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 244-50
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a remarkably frequent disorder that leads to
      relevant impairment in patients' quality of life. Four mechanisms are involved in
      the pathogenesis of IBS: altered intestinal motility; increased visceral
      sensitivity; disturbed intestinal reflexes (intrinsic and extrinsic), and
      psychological disorders. The close relationship between the central nervous
      system and the enteric nervous system (the brain-gut axis) is the basis of the
      actual research on IBS therapy. It is conceivable that in the near future a
      better understanding of IBS pathophysiology will help us to tailor treatment for 
      different IBS patients. At the moment, the subclassification of the diverse
      patterns of symptomatology allows the adjustment of treatments for IBS according 
      to the clinical predominance of each patient. Dietary modifications like fiber
      supplementation, antidiarrheal agents and antispasmodic drugs are the basis of
      the current treatment of IBS and depend on the predominant symptom (constipation,
      diarrhea or pain, respectively). If severe pain is present, antidepressant agents
      are an appropriate alternative. However, the scientific evidence supporting this 
      current therapeutic approach is limited. Visceral analgesics and serotonin
      agonists and antagonists may play an important therapeutic role in the near
      future. However, it is not likely that one single treatment will help every IBS
      patient and many of them will need a more complex approach with multidisciplinary
      therapy (diet, psychotherapy, medications).

TI  - Celiac disease-like abnormalities in a subgroup of patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome.
PG  - 1329-38
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Abdominal symptoms in the absence of mucosal abnormalities are
      features of both the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and latent/potential celiac
      disease (cd). To identify a possible subgroup of IBS patients with
      latent/potential cd, surrogate markers of cd were investigated in IBS patients.
      METHODS: IBS patients suffering from diarrhea (n = 102), and patients with active
      cd (n = 10), treated cd (n = 26), and latent cd (n = 5) were included in the
      study. We measured serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A against gliadin and
      tissue-transglutaminase, and IgA and IgM against gliadin, tissue-transglutaminase
      (intestinal cd-associated antibodies), and the dietary proteins
      beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin in duodenal aspirate by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were counted in histology
      sections, and the expression of HLA-DQ2 (A1*0501/B1*0201) was investigated by
      polymerase chain reaction. In 26 IBS patients, the effect of 6 months of gluten
      withdrawal was examined. RESULTS: Most cd patients expressed HLA-DQ2 and had
      increased intestinal cd-associated antibodies, whereas cd-associated serum IgA
      and IEL counts were increased in active cd in contrast to treated or latent cd.
      In IBS patients, 35% were HLA-DQ2-positive, 23% had increased IEL counts, and 0% 
      and 30% had increased cd-associated antibodies in serum and duodenal aspirate,
      respectively. Furthermore, stool frequency and intestinal IgA decreased
      significantly under a gluten-free diet in the subgroups of HLA-DQ2-positive and
      intestinal antibody-positive IBS patients when compared with IBS patients without
      these markers. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQ2 expression and increased intestinal
      cd-associated antibodies are markers that can identify latent/potential cd in a
      subgroup of IBS patients who consequently appear to profit from a gluten-free
      diet.

TI  - The effect of a lactose-restricted diet in patients with a positive lactose
      tolerance test, earlier diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome: a 5-year follow-up
      study.
PG  - 941-4
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospectively, the effect of a lactose-restricted diet was
      evaluated among irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption.
      Lactose malabsorption was defined by a positive hydrogen breath test and a
      positive blood-glucose test. An analysis of symptoms was completed before,
      during, 6 weeks after and 5 years after starting the diet. In addition, the
      number of visits made by the patients to the outpatient clinic was scored during 
      6 years. RESULTS: In 17 out of 70 irritable bowel syndrome patients (24.3%),
      lactose malabsorption was detected. There was no difference in the symptom score 
      between patients with a positive lactose tolerance test and patients with a
      negative lactose tolerance test. After 6 weeks of the lactose-restricted diet,
      symptoms were markedly improved in lactose malabsorption-positive patients (P <
      0.001). After 5 years, one patient was lost for follow-up, and 14 out of the
      remaining 16 lactose malabsorption patients (87.5%) still had no complaints
      during the lactose-restricted diet. Two patients chose not to follow the diet
      continuously and accepted the discomfort caused by lactose intake. Only two out
      of 16 patients (12.5%) no longer experienced any benefit from lactose
      restriction. In the 5 years before their diagnosis of lactose malabsorption,
      these 16 patients visited the outpatient clinic a total of 192 times (mean 2.4
      visits per year per person; range 1-7 visits). In the 5 years after diagnosis,
      they visited the outpatient clinic a total of 45 times (mean 0.6 visits per year 
      per person; range 0-6 visits; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large majority of
      irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption, which was
      previously clinically unrecognized, a lactose-restricted diet improved symptoms
      markedly both in the short term and the long term. Furthermore, visits by all
      patients to the outpatient clinic were reduced by 75%. We conclude that diet
      therapy is extremely cost- and time-saving. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
      that lactose malabsorption, which is easily treatable, is excluded before
      diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - The management of irritable bowel syndrome: a European, primary and secondary
      care collaboration.
PG  - 933-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop recommendations for the diagnosis and management of
      irritable bowel syndrome for European doctors delivering primary care. These
      recommendations can be adapted by local medical groups according to their
      language, custom and health-care systems. METHODS: Twenty-one general
      practitioners and gastroenterologists from Europe attended a workshop planned by 
      a steering committee. After a state-of-the-art symposium, four working groups
      considered the following aspects of irritable bowel syndrome management: what to 
      tell the patient, diagnosis, non-medical treatment and psychosocial management.
      Current and future drug management was reviewed by the steering committee. The
      resulting recommendations were considered at two plenary sessions during the
      meeting, and by circulation of the material during development of the manuscript.
      RESULTS: The process permitted a unique dialogue between general practitioners
      and gastroenterologists, in which it was necessary to reconcile the specialists' 
      emphasis on thoroughness with the practical, epidemiological and economic
      realities of primary care. Despite this dichotomy, consensus was achieved.
      CONCLUSIONS: European general practitioners and gastroenterologists have produced
      recommendations that emphasize education of the patient, a positive symptom-based
      diagnosis, diet and lifestyle advice, psychological support and a critical
      analysis of current specific psychological and pharmacological treatments.

TI  - Dietary treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: current evidence and guidelines
      for future practice.
PG  - 231-41
AB  - The aim of this literature review is to produce guidelines for dietetic practice 
      in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating the research available. In this
      area randomized control trials (RCT) only account for a small proportion of the
      literature and have been concentrated in the modification of dietary fibre in
      patients with IBS. The bulk of the literature is mainly observational trials from
      which no indisputable conclusions can be extracted. In this review, the evidence 
      available has been interpreted within the context of the current knowledge base. 
      Conclusions are drawn to facilitate the development of guidelines, enabling a
      starting point for discussion and an evaluation of current practice. The
      literature available on therapeutic dietary manipulation in IBS patients is
      centred around non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), mono and disaccharide
      sensitivity and food intolerance. The production of these guidelines has focused 
      on research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic
      management of patients with IBS. However, where there is a deficiency in the
      literature directly relating dietary intake to management of IBS patients,
      physiological function in relation to dietary components has been relied upon to 
      produce practical guidelines which can be applied realistically in a clinical
      environment. An interpretation of the evidence has revealed a limited role for
      exclusion diets, a move away from high-fibre diets towards the manipulation of
      fibre fractions in the diet, an evaluation of the effects of caffeine on gut
      function and the necessity for individual dietary assessment to identify dietary 
      issues pertinent to the patient's symptoms. These guidelines outline a positive
      role for dietitians in the treatment of IBS patients which draws on the unique
      skills possessed by dietitians regarding the assessment of habitual eating habits
      and therapeutic dietary manipulation.

TI  - Epidemiology of dyspepsia in the general population in Mumbai.
PG  - 103-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dyspepsia is a common complaint in the general population.
      The prevalence, demography and economic implications of dyspepsia in India are
      not known; we studied these using a detailed symptom questionnaire. METHODS: 2549
      presumably healthy adults (mean age 37.2 [14.1] years; 1441 men) were
      interviewed. Gastrointestinal symptoms, their investigation and treatment,
      dietary history and history of addictions were noted. Dyspepsia was defined as
      abdominal fullness or upper abdominal pain present for at least one month;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was defined by Manning's criteria. Based on the
      symptom profile, subjects were divided into three broad groups: no dyspepsia
      (n=1695; 945 men), dyspepsia with (110; 63 men) or without (664; 382 men) IBS,
      and IBS alone (80; 51 men). RESULTS: 774 subjects (30.4%) had dyspepsia; the
      median (range) duration of symptoms was 24 (1-360) months. Abdominal fullness
      (n=614), abdominal pain (374), heartburn (272) and belching (271) were the most
      common symptoms; significant symptoms (present at least once a week) occurred in 
      306 subjects (12.0% of the population). More than half the subjects had symptoms 
      suggestive of mixed type of dyspepsia; dysmotility-like dyspepsia was the next
      most common (n=257; 33.2%). The frequency of dyspepsia was not related to type of
      diet or consumption of spices. Dyspepsia was more prevalent in subjects who
      abused tobacco or alcohol. Three hundred and twenty-one subjects with dyspepsia
      (41.4%) had visited a physician for their complaints and had received treatment
      with antacids, acid suppressors or prokinetic drugs; 4.5% and 7.2% had undergone 
      previous endoscopy and ultrasonography, respectively; dyspeptic subjects
      underwent more investigations (p<0.001) than those with IBS. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dyspepsia is reported by almost one-third of the population in Mumbai;
      significant symptoms occur in 12%. Forty percent of these subjects receive
      treatment and only a small number undergo endoscopy or ultrasonography.

TI  - Colonic motility abnormality in patients with irritable bowel syndrome exhibiting
      abdominal pain and diarrhea.
PG  - 1499-506
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although colon dysmotility is recognized as a pathophysiological
      factor in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it has not been characterized. We have 
      investigated motility patterns in IBS patients with abdominal pain and frequent
      defecation or diarrhea and in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A recording catheter
      that had six polyvinyl tubes with infusion ports was placed in the transverse,
      descending, and sigmoid colon under fluoroscopy. After 2-h basal recordings,
      motility responses to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and a meal were studied
      for 3 h. The motility index (MI) and number of high amplitude propagating
      contractions (HAPCs) in 10 IBS patients were compared with those of 10 controls. 
      HAPCs were correlated with abdominal pain, and colon transit time using
      radio-opaque markers was determined. Using human colon muscle strips, the effect 
      of CCK-8 on muscle contractions was also studied. RESULTS: The MI and mean number
      and peak amplitude of HAPCs in IBS patients were significantly greater than in
      controls. These abnormalities paralleled markedly shortened colonic transit time.
      Abdominal pain coincided with >90% of HAPCs. Dose-dependent muscle contraction by
      CCK-8 was profoundly suppressed both by loxiglumide and atropine. CONCLUSIONS:
      The dysmotility in this subset of IBS patients was characterized by significantly
      increased occurrences of powerful HAPCs that paralleled rapid colon transit and
      were accompanied by abdominal pain. Thus, it is suggested that this powerful
      contraction is one of the causes of abdominal pain. The action of CCK-8 seems to 
      be mediated via the colon enteric nervous system.

PG  - 24-9
AB  - AIM: To determine prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and associated
      factors in a community-based population of adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 189
      schoolboys and 250 schoolgirls aged 14-17 years from four randomly chosen schools
      of Novosibirsk participated in the study. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS defined 
      according to Rome criteria was higher in girls (24 vs 14% in boys, p = 0.01).
      Colonic pain frequency was similar in both genders (11% in girls vs 9% in boys, p
      = 0.46), however disturbed defecation occurred significantly more often in girls 
      than in boys (16 vs 7%, p = 0.003). Half of the subjects who reported IBS had
      also dyspeptic symptoms. Fiber-rich diet and/or laxatives to prevent constipation
      were used by 2% of boys and 7% of girls (p = 0.012). However, only one third of
      those having less than 3 stools a week thought it abnormal. IBS is associated
      with the age over 15-16 years, female gender, abdominal pain in childhood,
      appendectomy, irregular meals and smoking (in girls). No association was found
      with other socio-demographic factors and serological markers of some infections
      and invasions (H. pylori, G. lamblia, O. felineus, hepatitis viruses B and C). Of
      the persons with diagnosable IBS, 49% have consulted a physician about it, 21%
      have undergone upper endoscopy. School absenteeism was reported by 62% of the IBS
      sufferers. CONCLUSION: IBS is common among adolescents (especially girls) with
      the prevalence rates similar to those described in adults from West Europe and
      USA. These disorders are associated with significant disability and health care
      costs.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption is associated with decreased plasma tryptophan.
PG  - 367-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fructose malabsorption is characterized by the inability to absorb
      fructose efficiently. As a consequence fructose reaches the colon where it is
      broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2, H2, CH4 and lactic acid.
      Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
      are the consequence and can be seen in about 50% of fructose malabsorbers.
      Recently it was found that fructose malabsorption was associated with early signs
      of depressive disorders. Therefore, it was investigated whether fructose
      malabsorption is associated with abnormal tryptophan metabolism. METHODS: Fifty
      adults (16 men, 34 women) with gastrointestinal discomfort were analyzed by
      measuring breath hydrogen concentrations after an oral dose of 50 g fructose
      after an overnight fast. They were classified as normals or fructose malabsorbers
      according to their breath H2 concentrations. All patients filled out a Beck
      depression inventory questionnaire. Blood samples were taken for plasma
      tryptophan and kynurenine measurements. RESULTS: Fructose malabsorption (breath
      deltaH2 production >20 ppm) was detected in 35 of 50 individuals (70%). Subjects 
      with fructose malabsorption showed significantly lower plasma tryptophan
      concentrations and significantly higher scores in the Beck depression inventory
      compared to those with normal fructose absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose
      malabsorption is associated with lower tryptophan levels that may play a role in 
      the development of depressive disorders. High intestinal fructose concentration
      seems to interfere with L-tryptophan metabolism, and it may reduce availability

TI  - Beneficial health effects of low-digestible carbohydrate consumption.
PG  - S23-30
AB  - Low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides
      that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small
      bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid
      metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In
      the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called
      fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is
      used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible
      carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to
      avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation
      products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are
      considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect
      of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates
      increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional
      constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel
      syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the
      maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs 
      between disease entities.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: is the search for lactose intolerance justified?
PG  - 219-25
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if confirmation of hypolactasia offers any benefit to
      the dietary treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      One hundred and twenty-two consecutive IBS patients (37 male, 85 female) were
      given lactose hydrogen breath tests (LHBT). Those with positive LHBT followed a
      low lactose diet for 3 weeks. Those improving on the diet were given
      double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges (DBPCC) with 5 g, 10 g and 15 g of
      lactose and a placebo, to confirm lactose intolerance. Those who did not respond 
      to the low lactose diet followed either an exclusion or low fibre diet. Symptoms 
      scores were kept prior to the LHBT, 8 h post-LHBT and daily whilst following any 
      dietary change. Patients with negative LHBT returned to clinic and subsequent
      dietary interventions were recorded. RESULTS: LHBT was positive in 33/122 (27%)
      IBS patients. Syrr otom scores prior to LHBT were not significantly different
      between the two groups, but after LHBT the symptoms in the positive group were
      significantly worse. Twenty-three patients followed a low-lactose diet of which
      only nine (39%) improved. Six who did not improve followed an exclusion diet,
      three improved and all were intolerant of milk. Three tried a low fibre diet with
      two improving. DBPCC were inconclusive. In the negative LHBT group 35 agreed to
      try a diet and 24 improved (69%). Eight were intolerant of cow's milk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of a low lactose diet was disappointing in IBS patients with
      lactose malabsorption. Food intolerance was demonstrated in IBS patients with
      positive or negative LHBT and milk was identified as a problem in both groups.
      DBPCC were inconclusive. There appears to be little advantage in trying to
      separate patients who malabsorb lactose from others with IBS.

TI  - Food hypersensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 439-49
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common condition but its pathophysiology remains
      poorly understood. Many irritable bowel syndrome patients give a history of food 
      intolerance, but data from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are
      inconclusive. Multiple aetio-pathological mechanisms have been postulated. The
      gut has an extensive immune system but current understanding of processing of
      food antigens in health and disease is limited. There is no clinically useful
      marker available to test for food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.
      Researchers have employed both skin tests and serum immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE)
      as markers of food hypersensitivity in various disorders including irritable
      bowel syndrome, but published data are equivocal. In this article, the evidence
      for the role of food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome is reviewed
      and, based on the available data, a possible pathophysiological hypothesis has
      been formulated.

TI  - [Nutritional therapy in gastrointestinal diseases. Diets--necessary or
      superfluous?].
PG  - 22-5
AB  - Diets form a part of the treatment concept in numerous gastrointestinal diseases.
      Their effectiveness, however, varies considerably from one disease to another.
      Thus, for example, diet is of decisive importance in celiac disease and lactose
      intolerance. In contrast, dietary measures are ineffective in the treatment of
      gallstones, and uncertain as a prophylactic measure against biliary colic. While 
      dietetic measures are an important temporary measure in acute pancreatitis, in
      chronic pancreatitis such an approach is often not complied with, since it
      includes abstinence from alcohol. In chronic inflammatory bowel disease, diet can
      ameliorate a number of complications, although it leaves the pathological process
      itself unaffected. High-fiber diet is, for the most part, ineffective in patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome. The present article discusses the benefits of
      dietary measures in a number of gastroenterological disorders.

TI  - Food-related gastrointestinal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 108-15
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). However, existing studies have come to different
      conclusions about the role of food in the pathophysiology of IBS. We explored the
      prevalence of subjective food-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and its
      relationship to clinical characteristics and psychological factors in IBS.
      METHODS: 330 patients with IBS and 80 healthy volunteers completed a food
      questionnaire developed for this study. The subjects graded their subjective
      symptoms after 35 different foods and a food score was obtained by adding the
      item scores. The relationship between subjective food-related GI symptoms and
      referral status, IBS subgroup (predominant bowel pattern), sex, anxiety,
      depression and body mass index (BMI) was estimated. RESULTS: In 209 (63%) of the 
      patients the GI symptoms were related to meals. Gas problems and abdominal pain
      were the most frequently reported symptoms. Foods rich in carbohydrates, as well 
      as fatty food, coffee, alcohol and hot spices were most frequently reported to
      cause symptoms. The food score was higher in patients than in controls (p <
      0.0001). In the IBS group higher scores were observed in patients with anxiety (p
      = 0.005), and females (p < 0.001), but the results were unrelated to IBS
      subgroup, referral status or BMI. The BMI did not differ between groups.
      CONCLUSION: A majority of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to
      meals. Especially foods rich in carbohydrates and fat cause problems.
      Nevertheless, the majority of IBS patients are normal or overweight. Female sex
      and anxiety predict a high degree of food-related symptoms in IBS.

TI  - Alosetron improves quality of life in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 455-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of alosetron, a
      treatment recently approved in the United States for irritable bowel syndrome in 
      diarrhea-predominant female patients, on health-related quality of life. METHODS:
      Quality of life was assessed as part of two 12-wk randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled irritable bowel syndrome studies comparing alosetron 1 mg
      b.i.d. with placebo (S3BA3001 and S3BA3002). Patients completed a validated
      disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, the Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL), at baseline and at the 12-wk or final
      visit. The clinical relevance of data were also evaluated by a minimal meaningful
      difference instrument. RESULTS: A total of 626 and 647 patients were enrolled in 
      studies S3BA3001 and S3BA3002, respectively. Approximately 70% of patients in
      each study had diarrhea-predominant IBS. In diarrhea-predominant patients
      enrolled in S3BA3001, statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements with
      alosetron versus placebo were observed on all nine IBSQOL scales (emotional
      health, mental health, sleep, energy, physical functioning, food/diet, social
      functioning, role-physical, and sexual relations) and for all but one scale
      (mental health) in S3BA3002. In both studies, a significantly greater percentage 
      of patients treated with alosetron (p < 0.05) experienced clinically meaningful
      improvement on three of the nine IBSQOL scales (food/diet, social functioning,
      and role-physical) compared with patients treated with placebo. Patients treated 
      with alosetron did not show worsening in any quality of life domain compared with
      patients treated with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results in women with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS demonstrate that alosetron significantly improves
      health-related quality of life.
