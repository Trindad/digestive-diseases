TI  - [Increased IgE-type antibody response to food allergens in irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 797-802
AB  - BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed
      defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively
      referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from
      dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the
      components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of 
      IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the 
      most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies
      against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and
      IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a
      healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency
      of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of
      the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food
      allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the
      immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control
      group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk
      protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of
      food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group,
      the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of 
      food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of
      this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a 
      diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate
      which is useful therapy in food allergy.

TI  - Treating irritable bowel syndrome with a food elimination diet followed by food
      challenge and probiotics.
PG  - 514-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the gut-associated immune system may be
      up-regulated resulting in immune complex production, low-grade inflammation, loss
      of Class I bacteria, and translocation of inflammatory mediators and
      macromolecules outside of the GI lumen. Since food intolerance may be one of the 
      reasons for this upregulation, our goal was to investigate the role of food
      intolerance in IBS patients. METHODS: In this open label pilot study, we enrolled
      20 patients with IBS by Rome II criteria (15 women, ages 24-81) who had failed
      standard medical therapies in a tertiary care GI clinic. Baseline serum IgE and
      IgG food and mold panels, and comprehensive stool analysis (CSA) were performed. 
      Breath-hydrogen testing and IBS Quality-of-Life (QOL) questionnaires were
      obtained. Patients underwent food elimination diets based on the results of food 
      and mold panels followed by controlled food challenge. Probiotics were also
      introduced. Repeat testing was performed at 6-months. We followed up with this
      cohort at 1 year after trial completion to assess the reported intervention and
      for placebo effect. RESULTS: Baseline abnormalities were identified on serum IgG 
      food and mold panels in 100% of the study subjects with significant improvement
      after food elimination and rotation diet (p < 0.05). Significant improvements
      were seen in stool frequency (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and IBS-QOL scores (p <
      0.0001). Imbalances of beneficial flora and dysbiotic flora were identified in
      100% of subjects by CSA. There was a trend to improvement of beneficial flora
      after treatment but no change in dysbiotic flora. The 1-year follow up
      demonstrated significant continued adherence to the food rotation diet (4.00 +/- 
      1.45), minimal symptomatic problems with IBS (4.00 +/- 1.17), and perception of
      control over IBS (4.15 +/- 1.23). The continued use of probiotics was considered 
      less helpful (3.40 +/- 1.60). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that identifying
      and appropriately addressing food sensitivity in IBS patients not previously
      responding to standard therapy results in a sustained clinical response and
      impacts on overall well being and quality of life in this challenging entity.

TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. A case control experience.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - AIM: As optimal therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains elusive,
      current approach to therapy is based on symptomatic treatment. With this
      case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS
      patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, 
      angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and
      probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus
      thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 
      women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean
      period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men
      and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their
      customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the
      presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and
      alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values,
      the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55%
      (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in 
      diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared
      with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was
      found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups
      showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was
      statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension
      (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a 
      significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of 
      bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term
      benefit of the study product.

TI  - Effects of fasting therapy on irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 214-20
AB  - How to treat patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who do not respond to
      pharmacotherapy is an unsolved problem. Psychotherapy, which has been reported on
      in previous studies, is available only in specific centers. We describe in this
      study a novel and simple psychotherapy; that is, the fasting therapy (FT) for
      treatment of patients with IBS. Of 84 inpatients with IBS, 58 patients who still 
      had moderate to severe IBS symptoms after 4-week basic treatment were
      investigated retrospectively. Of the 58 patients enrolled in this study, 36
      underwent FT, whereas the remaining 22 received a consecutive basic treatment
      (control therapy). There were no significant differences in the 4-point severity 
      scales of gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms between the 2 groups before
      the start of FT. The basic treatment consisted of pharmacotherapy and brief
      psychotherapy, whereas the FT consisted of 10 days of starvation followed by 5
      days of refeeding. Changes in scores of symptoms before and after each treatment 
      were analyzed. FT significantly improved 7 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that 
      is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p < .001), abdominal distension (p < .001),
      diarrhea (p < .001), anorexia (p = .02), nausea (p < .01), anxiety (p < .001),
      and interference with life in general (p < .001). However, the control therapy
      significantly improved only 3 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal
      pain-discomfort (p = .03), abdominal distension (p < .01), and interference with 
      life (p = .01). Our results suggest that FT may have beneficial effects on
      intractable patients with IBS.

TI  - Positive coeliac serology in irritable bowel syndrome patients with normal
      duodenal biopsies: Video capsule endoscopy findings and HLA-DQ typing may affect 
      clinical management.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate a group of IBS patients (Rome criteria) with positive 
      coeliac serology (EMA, TTG, IgG or IgA AGA) and normal small bowel biopsies.
      Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) findings of the small bowell were compared with
      DQ-typing. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with chronic abdominal pain (with or
      without diarrhea) and at least one positive result of any of the coeliac
      serological markers (AGA, TTG, EMA) and normal duodenal biopsy were enrolled and 
      underwent VCE. Twelve healthy volunteers with VCE served as control group.
      Coeliac related HLA DQ2 or DQ8 markers were determined. RESULTS: 12/ 22 (55%)
      patients had small bowel abnormalities with VCE. No mucosal abnormalities were
      recognized in the control group (p = 0.002). Inflammatory changes were classified
      as moderate or pronounced. Eight patients (36%) had moderate changes and four
      patients (18%) demonstrated pronounced changes. Only 6 of the 21 IBS patients
      were positive for DQ2 and/or DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: The patients in this study
      fulfilled the diagnostic Rome criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. We suggest
      that patients with positive coeliac serology and normal duodenal biopsies should 
      undergo HLA typing. In patients positive for DQ2 and/or DQ8, a VCE should be
      performed. Patients with mucosal abnormalities compatible with CD should be
      considered as a group distinct from IBS patients and could be tested with gluten 
      challenge or treated with a gluten free diet.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: guidelines for
      effective dietary management.
PG  - 1631-9
AB  - Dietary fructose induces abdominal symptoms in patients with fructose
      malabsorption, but there are no published guidelines on its dietary management.
      The objective was to retrospectively evaluate a potentially successful diet
      therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption.
      Tables detailing the content of fructose and fructans in foods were constructed. 
      A dietary strategy comprising avoidance of foods containing substantial free
      fructose and short-chain fructans, limitation of the total dietary fructose load,
      encouragement of foods in which glucose was balanced with fructose, and
      co-ingestion of free glucose to balance excess free fructose was devised.
      Sixty-two consecutively referred patients with irritable bowel syndrome and
      fructose malabsorption on breath hydrogen testing underwent dietary instruction. 
      Dietary adherence and effect on abdominal symptoms were evaluated via telephone
      interview 2 to 40 months (median 14 months) later. Response to the diet was
      defined as improvement of all symptoms by at least 5 points on a -10- to 10-point
      scale. Forty-eight patients (77%) adhered to the diet always or frequently.
      Forty-six (74%) of all patients responded positively in all abdominal symptoms.
      Positive response overall was significantly better in those adherent than
      nonadherent (85% vs 36%; P<0.01), as was improvement in individual symptoms
      (P<0.01 for all symptoms). This comprehensive fructose malabsorption dietary
      therapy achieves a high level of sustained adherence and good symptomatic
      response.

AB  - The therapy of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is often challenging,
      especially if a broad spectrum of symptoms is present and trigger factors, such
      as the influence of diet or stress, are lacking. Current pathogenetic concepts
      propose central or peripheral alterations that cause disturbed gastrointestinal
      function (motility, visceral sensitivity) and subsequent symptoms. These
      alterations are possibly related to psychological (stress, depression, anxiety)
      and biological (post-infectious residuals, micro-inflammation) influences. Since 
      no universally effective medical treatment is available to treat the causes of
      the disease, standard medical therapy is symptom directed (especially for pain,
      constipation and diarrhoea). In addition to well established drugs (like
      spasmolytics, opioids and laxatives), newly developed compounds including those
      with other primarily indications (e.g. antidepressants) are available for highly 
      differentiated individualized therapies. New medical approaches which are
      currently undergoing evaluation, promise further progress in the treatment of
      IBS.

TI  - Is there any food I can eat? Living with inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
      and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair
      quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living.
      Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the
      evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders,
      particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the
      strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning 
      coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall
      objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had
      been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome.
      This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable
      bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females,
      diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were
      recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada.
      Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires,
      e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed 
      for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means 
      by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or
      controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of
      determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of 
      stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research,
      predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates 
      the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women
      identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that
      they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health 
      nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.

TI  - Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, 
      or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore
      expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics,
      whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to
      incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for 
      prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the
      Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large 
      intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer,
      focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language.
      Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or
      meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose,
      galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large
      bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These
      carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and
      intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small.
      Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few,
      although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel
      disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early
      days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial
      balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.

TI  - Is there a role of food allergy in irritable bowel syndrome and functional
      dyspepsia? A systematic review.
PG  - 595-607
AB  - A significant proportion of adults believe they suffer from food allergy, and
      20-65% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their symptoms
      to something in food that activates an abnormal response. This systematic review 
      evaluates the role of food allergy in aetiology and management of these
      disorders. Activation of gastrointestinal mucosal immune system may be one of the
      causative factors in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia and IBS. This
      activation may result from effects of bacterial infection or other luminal
      factors including commensal microbial flora and food antigens. Some studies have 
      reported on the role of food allergy in IBS; only one epidemiological study on
      functional dyspepsia and food allergy has been published. The mechanism by which 
      food activates mucosal immune system is uncertain, but food specific IgE and IgG4
      appeared to mediate the hypersensitivity reaction in a subgroup of IBS patients. 
      Exclusion diets based on skin prick test, RAST for IgE or IgG4, hypoallergic diet
      and clinical trials with oral disodium cromoglycate have been conducted, and some
      success has been reported in a subset of IBS patients. Further well-controlled
      studies are needed to establish whether food allergy plays a role in the
      pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia and IBS.

TI  - [Role of allergy in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 1532-5
AB  - Preliminary studies have noted a possible association between IBS and allergic
      disorders. An increased prevalence of bronchial hyper-responsiveness in IBS has
      been reported. Moreover, foods are thought to often play a role in the diarrhea
      type IBS particularly in patients with atopic dermatitis. More than 50% of
      diarrhea type IBS patients have a history of allergies to some food and positive 
      skin prick tests. Surveys indicate that as many as 20-30 % of adults have some
      problems to foods, however, careful studies have suggested a range from <1% to
      7.5%. A systematic review of the literature concluded that it is still unclear
      whether diet is a key factor in exacerbating IBS symptoms and whether dietary
      manipulation is a valid treatment. The further studies are needed to evaluate the
      association between IBS and allergic disorders.

      advice].
PG  - 1511-5
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal illness. In spite
      of its benign nature, we should pay much attention to IBS because of its huge
      negative impacts on 'quality of life', not only for mental or physical pain and
      medical expenses but also for significant social and job-related consequences.
      The treatment of IBS is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Labour
      and Welfare in Japan, with a proper physician-patient rapport. At the first step 
      in these guidelines, physicians should advise IBS patients about their diet and
      lifestyle according to their main symptoms. It is also essential for the
      physicians to educate the patients properly, which relieves the symptoms in many 
      cases without any cost involvement and untoward side effects.

TI  - Bran and irritable bowel syndrome: the primary-care perspective.
PG  - 737-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have shown that bran exacerbates irritable bowel syndrome symptoms
      in a large proportion of secondary-care patients. However, it is unknown if this 
      also happens in primary-care or whether a better response to bran occurs, leading
      to bran failures being selected for referral to the specialist. AIMS: To assess
      the response to bran in primary-care irritable bowel syndrome comparing it to
      that obtained in secondary-care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive
      primary-care irritable bowel syndrome patients were asked how bran or soluble
      fibre products affected their symptoms. RESULTS: Bran improved symptoms in 27% of
      primary-care and 10% of secondary-care patients (p<0.01) and exacerbated symptoms
      in 22% of primary-care and 55% of secondary-care patients (p<0.001). Fifty-one
      percent of primary-care and 33% of secondary-care patients reported no change
      with bran. In primary-care, proprietary fibre led to improvement in 25%,
      deterioration in 19% and no change in 56% which was not significantly different
      to secondary-care. CONCLUSION: Although not especially effective in primary-care 
      irritable bowel syndrome patients, bran does not cause so many problems and is
      more helpful than in secondary-care. The effects of soluble fibre are similar in 
      both primary-care and secondary-care. This study highlights the problem of
      extrapolating the response to treatment in irritable bowel syndrome from
      different care settings.

      physicians (FP), and Gastroenterology physicians (GI) evaluate and treat IBS
      patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was sent to 3000 physicians nationwide, 
      1000 each to IM, FP, and GI. The survey contained 35 questions assessing
      demographics, the etiology and pathophysiology of IBS, the use of diagnostic
      tests, and practice patterns and attitudes. RESULTS: Of the deliverable
      questionnaires, 501 were returned completed; 472 of the respondents interviewed
      only adult patients, representing the cohort for this analysis. The mean age of
      all respondents was 47; most were men (80%). IM and FP made a new diagnosis of
      IBS 1.3-1.6 times each week, while GI made a new diagnosis 5.4 times each week
      (p<0.0001). Compared with the perceptions of FP and IM, GI felt that IBS patients
      were less sick than other patients (p<0.001), although they required more time
      per visit. More GI compared with FP and IM stated that prior infection and a
      history of abuse were the causes of IBS (p<0.01), while FP were more likely to
      believe that diet was a cause of IBS (p<0.01). GI felt a new diagnosis of IBS
      could be made without further testing 42% of the time. FP and IM felt that
      one-third of IBS patients needed referral to a GI. CONCLUSIONS: The attitudes and
      practice patterns of physicians towards patients with IBS differ depending on
      practice specialty. This may be due to differences in training, the ability to
      perform specialized tests, and/or differences in referral patterns. Further
      training may improve the ability of physicians in all specialties confidently to 
      diagnose and treat patients with IBS.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in adult coeliac disease in Germany: results of a 
      national survey.
PG  - 747-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: No national survey on the present clinical spectrum and health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) in people with coeliac disease has been conducted in
      Germany until now. METHODS: The German Coeliac Society DZG posted a set of
      questionnaires (self-developed socio-demographic and medical questionnaire, the
      Short Form Health Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the
      Giessen Symptom Check List) to 1000/18 355 of their members who were >/=18 years 
      (every 18th member following consecutive postal codes of the membership
      directory). RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-six usable questionnaires were
      returned (diagnosis proven by biopsy; 78% female, median age 45.5 years). The
      median interval between the first medical examination due to symptoms of coeliac 
      disease and the final diagnosis was 1 year. Ninety-eight percent reported a
      reduction of initial symptoms, 85% an improvement of HRQOL with a median gain in 
      weight of 8 kg after starting a gluten-free diet (median duration of 6 years).
      Sixty-seven percent adhered all the time to the dietary regimen and 26% adhered
      most of the time. The most frequent diseases associated with coeliac disease were
      osteoporosis (15%), oral aphtae (12%) and dermatitis herpetiformis (9%). Because 
      of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms 26% of the patients met the modified
      Rome I criteria for irritable bowel symptom. Compared to representative samples
      from the German population, coeliac disease patients had higher scores for
      anxiety , fatigue, dyspeptic and musculoskeletal pain, and a reduced HRQOL in
      9/10 scales of the SF-36 (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite being on a
      gluten-free diet German coeliac disease patients suffer from a high burden of
      general and extra-intestinal symptoms and a reduced HRQOL.

TI  - Nucleotide supplementation: a randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial of
      IntestAidIB in people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome [ISRCTN67764449].
PG  - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary nucleotide supplementation has been shown to have important
      effects on the growth and development of cells which have a rapid turnover such
      as those in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract. Work with infants
      has shown that the incidence and duration of diarrhoea is lower when nucleotide
      supplementation is given, and animal work shows that villi height and crypt depth
      in the intestine is increased as a result of dietary nucleotides. Dietary
      nucleotides may be semi-essential under conditions of ill-health, poor diet or
      stress. Since people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome tend to fulfil these
      conditions, we tested the hypothesis that symptoms would be improved with dietary
      nucleotide supplementation. METHODS: Thirty-seven people with a diagnosis of
      Irritable Bowel gave daily symptom severity ratings for abdominal pain,
      diarrhoea, urgency to have a bowel movement, incomplete feeling of evacuation
      after a bowel movement, bloating, flatulence and constipation for 28 days
      (baseline). They were then assigned to either placebo (56 days) followed by
      experimental (56 days) or the reverse. There was a four week washout period
      before crossover. During the placebo and experimental conditions participants
      took one 500 mg capsule three times a day; in the experimental condition the
      capsule contained the nutroceutical substances. Symptom severity ratings and
      psychological measures (anxiety, depression, illness intrusiveness and general
      health) were obtained and analysed by repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Symptom 
      severity for all symptoms (except constipation) were in the expected direction of
      baseline>placebo>experimental condition. Symptom improvement was in the range 4 -
      6%. A feeling of incomplete evacuation and abdominal pain showed the most
      improvement. The differences between conditions for diarrhoea, bloating and
      flatulence were not significant at the p < .05 level. There were no significant
      differences between the conditions for any of the psychological measures.
      CONCLUSION: Dietary nucleotide supplementation improves some of the symptoms of
      irritable bowel above baseline and placebo level. As expected, placebo effects
      were high. Apart from abdominal pain and urgency to have a bowel movement, the
      improvements, while consistent, are modest, and were not accompanied by
      improvements in any of the psychological measures. We suggest that the percentage
      improvement over and above the placebo effect is a physiological effect of the
      nucleotide supplement on the gut. The mechanisms by which these effects might
      improve symptoms are discussed.

TI  - Functional bowel disorders.
PG  - 1480-91
AB  - Employing a consensus approach, our working team critically considered the
      available evidence and multinational expert criticism, revised the Rome II
      diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders, and updated diagnosis and
      treatment recommendations. Diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder (FBD)
      requires characteristic symptoms during the last 3 months and onset > or =6
      months ago. Alarm symptoms suggest the possibility of structural disease, but do 
      not necessarily negate a diagnosis of an FBD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      functional bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are best
      identified by symptom-based approaches. Subtyping of IBS is controversial, and we
      suggest it be based on stool form, which can be aided by use of the Bristol Stool
      Form Scale. Diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary
      symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Treatment of
      FBDs is based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance.
      Alterations in diet, drug treatment aimed at predominant symptoms, and
      psychotherapy may be beneficial.

TI  - Monitoring nonresponsive patients who have celiac disease.
PG  - 317-27
AB  - Because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and
      because treatment exists that is effective in most cases, screening of the
      general population for celiac disease has been considered. There is still no
      evidence that patients who have symptom-free celiac disease are at increased risk
      of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. Prevention of osteoporosis
      seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today [22]. The
      major cause of failure to respond to a gluten-free diet is continuing ingestion
      of gluten, but other underlying diseases must be considered. Many different drugs
      (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) have been used in patients who have 
      RCD [23]. Steroid treatment has been reported to be effective even in patients
      who have underlying early EATL. Histologic recovery in patients who have celiac
      disease usually takes several months but can take up to 1 year, even if the
      patient remains on a strict gluten-free diet. Some patients report celiac-related
      symptoms for months after a single gluten intake. The definitions for RCD in
      literature vary. The authors consider the definition give by Daum and colleagues 
      [24] suitable. They defined true RCD as villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia
      and increased IELs persisting for more than 12 months in spite of a strict
      gluten-free diet. If a patient is not responding well to a gluten-free diet,
      three considerations are necessary: (1) the initial diagnosis of celiac disease
      must be reassessed;(2) the patient should be sent to a dietician to check for
      errors in diet or compliance problems, because problems with the gluten-free diet
      are the most important cause for persisting symptoms; (3) other reasons for
      persisting symptoms (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome,
      bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative
      jejunitis, protein-losing enteropathy,T-cell lymphoma, fructose intolerance,
      cavitating lymphadenopathy, and tropical sprue) should be considered. Other
      causes for villous atrophy are Crohn's disease, collagenous sprue, and autoimmune
      enteropathy. Abdulkarim and colleagues [25] examined 55 patients who had a
      diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease. He found that 6 did not have celiac
      disease, and25 still had some gluten ingestion.Tursi and colleagues [26] reported
      15 patients who had celiac disease with persisting symptoms. Because histology
      improved in all patients after several months, RCD was excluded. Of the 15
      patients, 10 had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 2 showed lactose
      malabsorption causing the described symptoms, 1 had mistakenly taken an
      antibiotic containing gluten, and 1 patient each had Giardia lamblia and Ascaris 
      lumbricoides. Thus, other entities must be considered in patients who have celiac
      disease and ongoing symptoms. In a follow-up clinical trial, 158 patients who had
      celiac disease underwent follow-up small intestine biopsies within 2 years after 
      starting a gluten-free diet. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial)
      villous atrophy were considered to have RCD; 5 of them developed EATL [27].RCD
      type I is characterized by normal expression of T-cell antigens and polyclonal
      TCR gene rearrangement.RCD type II is characterized by an abnormal IEL phenotype 
      with the expression of intracytoplasmic CD3e, surface CD103, and the lack of
      classic surface T-cell markers such as CD8, CD4, and TCR-alpha/beta. This clonal 
      IEL population can be considered crypt IEL [24]. RCD II has a poor prognosis,
      which is a problem for therapy. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements and loss of T-cell
      antigens such as CD8 and TCR-beta in IELs may indicate the development of an EATL
      in patients who have RCD. The markers for an overt EATL are a positive stool
      blood test, increased lactate dehydrogenase, or beta2-microglobulin [24]. If an
      overt lymphoma is suspected, upper and lower endoscopy, an ear, nose, and throat 
      work-up, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and possibly double-balloon enteroscopy
      should be performed. Most reports of the difficulties in treating patients who
      have true RCE are casereports. Turner and colleagues [28] reported on an
      induction of remission by useof the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab and
      maintenance with prednisoloneand azathioprine. Olaussen and colleagues [29] and
      Mandal and colleagues [30]tried a nonimmunogenic elemental diet. Gillet and
      colleagues [31] reported successful treatment of a patient who hadRCD using
      anti-TNF-alpha antibodies (infliximab) for induction and azathioprinefor
      maintenance. Maurino and colleagues [32] studied seven consecutive patients
      diagnosed ashaving refractory sprue and no response to oral or parenteral
      steroids. Aftertreatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d) and oral prednisone (1
      mg/kg/d), fivepatients had a complete clinical remission. Two patients who did
      not respond totreatment at any time died. Goerres and colleagues [33] described
      18 patients who had RCD, 10 of whomhad type I RCD, and 8 of whom had type II RCD.
      Treatment consisted ofazathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year.
      Consistent with reports byother investigators, the response rates in the two
      groups differed. Eight of the10 patients who had type I RCD had a histologic
      response. Seven of the eightpatients who had type II RCD died, and six of the
      eight developed a lymphoma. At present there is no effective treatment for type
      II RCD.Fig. 3 presents a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients who have

TI  - Impact of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL).
PG  - 241-6
AB  - AIMS: To assess the impact of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on patient-reported 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: Two HRQOL instruments were
      administered by telephone interviews to a sample of 253 IBS French patients
      recruited from the general population. IBS was diagnosed according to the
      Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria. Patients with organic diseases were
      excluded from the study. A generic instrument, the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and an 
      IBS disease-specific instrument, the IBSQOL, were used. RESULTS: Patients with
      IBS had statistically significant (P<0.05) lower scores for all SF-36 QOL domains
      compared with the general French population. Women (N=192) reported significantly
      (P<0.05) poorer HRQOL on both the SF-36 and the IBSQOL scores than men (N=61) for
      all domains except energy on the SF36 and the sleep on the IBSQOL. HRQOL
      deteriorated with time since onset of IBS symptoms for some domains such as diet.
      For both instruments, a positive correlation was observed between low scores and 
      intensity of pain and discomfort. IBS patients with a predominance of diarrhea
      (N=72) exhibited significantly greater impairment of HRQOL in the emotional
      domain than IBS persons with constipation predominance (N=65) (P<or=0.05).
      CONCLUSION: IBS has a significant impact on HRQOL of patients. In addition,
      specific characteristics such as gender, symptom severity and time since onset of
      symptoms are predictive of more impaired health-related quality of life.

TI  - Increased symptoms in female IBS patients with dysmenorrhea and PMS.
PG  - 4-11
AB  - Women with irritable bowel syndrome often report premenstrual distress syndrome
      and dysmenorrhea. A descriptive, four-group comparison design was used to compare
      the symptoms and psychological distress levels of women with irritable bowel
      syndrome (age 18-45 years) with and without dysmenorrhea and premenstrual
      distress syndrome. Data from three studies on women with irritable bowel syndrome
      (n = 226) collected between 1995 and 2004 were combined. Of these, 38 had
      self-reported irritable bowel syndrome with dysmenorrhea and premenstrual
      distress syndrome, 59 had irritable bowel syndrome with premenstrual distress
      syndrome, 15 had irritable bowel syndrome and dysmenorrhea, and the remaining 114
      had irritable bowel syndrome only. Participants completed the Symptom
      Checklist-90 Revised and a symptom diary. Pain symptoms and computed scales of
      anxiety, depression, anger, and cognitive difficulties were compared during the
      luteal phase, menses phase, and for the change from luteal to menses phases.
      Premenstrual distress syndrome and dysmenorrhea had a strong impact on uterine
      cramping at menses, and a weaker effect on other pain symptoms at both luteal and
      menses phases. Premenstrual distress syndrome was associated with higher
      depression, anger, and cognitive problems at both luteal and menses phases;
      however, it was not associated with a greater increase from luteal to menses
      phases for any symptoms other than uterine cramping. The multiple symptoms
      reported by women with both irritable bowel syndrome and premenstrual distress
      syndrome suggest that this group may be particularly challenging to treat and may
      require a multicomponent (e.g., education, diet, relaxation, cognitive
      restructuring) approach.

TI  - [Naturopathic dietary treatment in functional disorders].
PG  - 34-6
AB  - When applied to functional disorders, dietary treatment- the most important
      measure in natural medicine - has its greatest effect when these disorders affect
      the gastrointestinal tract, in particular epigastric dyspepsia and irritable
      bowel syndrome. On the basis of a comprehensive dietary anamnesis, it is often
      possible to identify foodstuffs and eating behavior capable of aggravating the
      patient's symptoms. The underlying basic principle of treatment is that the
      gastrointestinal tract first undergo a temporary period of rest before being
      gradually re-accustomed to a biologically high-quality diet. A central approach
      includes various forms of fasting therapy, in particular in the case of severe
      conditions, which can usefully be supported by additional relaxation techniques, 
      psychotherapy, hydrotherapy, massage and special manual techniques.

TI  - Colonic diverticular disease: pathophysiology and clinical picture.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - Colonic diverticulosis is the most frequent structural abnormality of the large
      bowel, although it was a rarity before the 20th century. Lifestyle changes in
      westernized societies with reduced fiber diet are supposed to be the main cause
      for its high prevalence nowadays. In African countries, where staple diet is rich
      in fiber, diverticulosis remains very infrequent. Prevalence increases with
      ageing too. A fiber-deficient diet and subsequent reduction in bowel content
      volume would lead to increased intraluminal pressures and colonic segmentation,
      thus promoting diverticula formation. Animal and human studies have shown
      increased intracolonic pressures in patients with diverticulosis. Alterations in 
      colonic muscle properties, collagen metabolism and in the interactions of the
      extracellular matrix components may play a role in remodelling the gut wall in
      diverticular disease. At least one fourth of patients with diverticulosis will
      develop symptoms, sometimes overlapping with irritable bowel syndrome, but 10-25%
      will suffer diverticulitis and 3-5% diverticular bleeding. Conservative medical
      management is usually sufficient in the first episode of diverticulitis, but
      surgical treatment is generally advocated in recurrences. Diverticular bleeding
      is a major cause of lower digestive haemorrhage, but generally self-limited. With
      the application of therapeutic endoscopic and angiographic methods, emergency
      surgery can often be avoided.

      bowel disorders.
PG  - 28-37
AB  - Functional digestive disorders constitute one of the main causes of consultation 
      in gastroenterology and primary health care. Is still unclear whether therapy has
      to be aimed to the gut, to the neural pathways controlling bowel motility and
      perception, or to the processing mechanisms of symptoms and disease behaviour. It
      is conceivable that in the next future better understanding of functional bowel
      disorders pathophysiology will help us to tailor treatment for different
      patients. At the moment, subclassification of the diverse patterns of
      symptomatology allows to adjust new treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      according to the clinical predominance for each patient. The knowledge of motor
      and sensorial response to different stimuli in IBS patients and the pathways to
      the central nervous system is an important source of information for the
      development of new molecules. Fiber-enriched diet is frequently given for
      constipation-predominant IBS. Loperamide, antispasmodic drugs and tricyclic
      antidepressants are nowadays the basis for pharmacological treatment of diarrhea-
      predominant IBS. The scientific evidence supporting this therapeutical approach
      is however limited. Visceral analgesics and serotonin agonists and antagonists
      may play an important therapeutical role in the near future. However, it is not
      likely that one single treatment will help every functional bowel disorder
      patient and many of them will need a more complex approach with a
      multidisciplinary therapy (diet, psychotherapy, medications).

TI  - Proximal and distal gut hormone secretion in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 170-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sensory and motor dysfunctions of the gut are both important
      characteristics of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Several gut peptides
      contribute to the regulation of gastrointestinal function but little is known
      about gut hormone secretion in IBS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated perceptual
      thresholds and fasting and postprandial plasma levels of proximal
      (cholecystokinin (CCK), motilin) and distal (peptide YY) gut peptides up to 1 h
      after ingestion of a high caloric meal in 99 IBS patients and 40 age- and
      gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Fasting plasma CCK levels were
      significantly elevated in patients (1.2+/-0.8 pM) compared with those in controls
      (0.8+/-0.7 pM, p=0.006), as was the incremental postprandial CCK response
      (72+/-73 versus 40+/-42 pM.60 min, respectively; p=0.003). No differences in
      fasting and postprandial motilin or PYY levels were found. The postprandial PYY
      response was significantly increased in hypersensitive compared to normosensitive
      patients (215+/-135 versus 162+/-169 pM, p=0.048). Patients with a diarrhoea
      predominant bowel habit had higher fasting motilin levels compared to constipated
      patients or alternating type IBS patients (82.1+/-36.5 versus 60.8+/-25.1 versus 
      57.5+/-23.9 pM, one-way ANOVA p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients have increased 
      fasting and postprandial plasma levels of CCK. Changes in plasma levels of
      motilin and PYY may contribute to the clinical expression of IBS, such as the
      presence of visceral hypersensitivity or a predominant bowel habit.

TI  - Meal induced rectosigmoid tone modification: a low caloric meal accurately
      separates functional and organic gastrointestinal disease patients.
PG  - 1409-14
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on
      arbitrary criteria due to the lack of an accurate diagnostic test. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate whether rectosigmoid tone modification after a meal
      represents an accurate diagnostic approach. METHODS: In a secondary care setting,
      32 constipation predominant and 24 diarrhoea predominant IBS patients, 10
      functional diarrhoea and 10 functional constipation patients, 29 organic
      gastrointestinal disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers underwent a rectal
      barostat test to measure fasting and postprandial rectosigmoid tone. Rectosigmoid
      response was assessed following three meals containing different amounts of
      calories: 200 kcal, 400 kcal and 1000 kcal. RESULTS: After 200 kcal, healthy
      volunteers and patients with organic diseases showed a reduction in rectosigmoid 
      volume of at least 28% of fasting volume, indicating a meal induced increase in
      muscle tone. In contrast, patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS showed dilation
      of the rectosigmoid colon, indicative of reduced tone, and patients with
      constipation predominant IBS showed a mild volume reduction or no modification.
      Functional diarrhoea and constipation patients showed rectosigmoid tone
      modification resembling that of the corresponding IBS subtype. A 400 kcal meal
      normalised rectosigmoid tone in more than half of the constipation predominant
      IBS patients but none of the diarrhoea predominant IBS patients. In contrast, a
      1000 kcal meal normalised tone response in all IBS patients. Sensitivity of the
      test was 100%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 96%, and negative
      predictive value 100%. CONCLUSION: A postprandial reduction in rectosigmoid tone 
      of at least 28% of fasting value after a low caloric meal accurately separates
      organic and functional gastrointestinal disease patients. This parameter may
      therefore be used in the positive diagnosis of IBS.

TI  - [Atypical manifestations of celiac disease in an adult woman].
PG  - 70-1
AB  - Celiac disease is intolerance to gluten that classically produces chronic
      diarrhea with a picture of malabsorption and a total villous atrophy. These
      elements regress completely in a sequential way under a prolonged gluten-free
      diet. We describe a case of a 35-year-old woman affected by celiac disease who
      presented atypically, with features including hypoproteinaemia (38g/L) with
      dominant hypoalbuminaemia (12g/L), weight loss, strong psychoneurotic component
      and amenorrhoea. These manifestations for the first time were diagnosed as
      irritable bowel disease and after immunology diagnostic as celiac disease.
      Current research on celiac disease has pointed out the biologically significant
      role of antigliadin antibodies IgG and IgA and antibodies to tissue
      transglutaminase (tTg).

TI  - Role of partially hydrolyzed guar gum in the treatment of irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 334-42
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the world's most common gastrointestinal
      functional disorder and is associated with several social and economic costs.
      Health-related quality of life is often impaired in patients with IBS. The
      pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IBS remain poorly defined. The therapeutic
      approach to patients with IBS is based on symptoms, and fibers may play an
      important role in treatment. Among the various types of fiber, water-soluble,
      non-gelling fibers seem to be a promising option for treatment of IBS. Partially 
      hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble, non-gelling fiber that has
      provided therapeutic benefits. In clinical trials, PHGG decreased symptoms in
      constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS and decreased
      abdominal pain. Further, an improvement in quality of life was observed in
      patients with IBS during and after treatment with PHGG. Moreover, PHGG seems to
      have prebiotic properties because it increases the colonic contents of
      short-chain fatty acids, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria.

TI  - Altered 5-hydroxytryptamine signaling in patients with constipation- and
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 34-43
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Evidence suggests that postprandial platelet-depleted plasma
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations may be abnormal in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). However, interpretation of the data has been hampered by the
      variable methodology and rather small numbers used in previous studies.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure concentrations of
      platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA under fasting and fed
      conditions in a large group of patients with diarrhea-predominant (d-) and
      constipation-predominant (c-) IBS, compared with controls. The ratio of plasma
      5-HIAA:5-HT and platelet stores was also assessed. METHODS: Twenty-nine c-IBS
      patients (aged, 19-53 years), 55 d-IBS patients (aged, 19-52 years), and 35
      healthy volunteers (aged, 18-46 years) had platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT/5-HIAA
      concentrations measured using reverse-phase, high-performance liquid
      chromatography with fluorimetric detection before and after a standard meal.
      RESULTS: d-IBS patients had raised platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT concentrations
      under fasting and fed conditions (P < .05). However, the postprandial relative to
      fasting concentration was similar to controls. In contrast, c-IBS patients failed
      to show an increase in platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT concentration with meal
      ingestion compared with controls (P < .01). c-IBS was associated with decreased
      5-HIAA (P < .01) but normal 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio and d-IBS with normal 5-HIAA
      concentrations but reduced 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio (P < .005). C-IBS but not d-IBS
      patients had increased platelet 5-HT. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the
      concept that d-IBS is characterized by reduced 5-HT reuptake, whereas impaired
      release may be a feature of c-IBS. These results also provide a rational basis
      for current pharmacologic approaches involving modulation of different 5-HT
      receptors in c- and d-IBS.

TI  - The role of fiber in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: therapeutic
      recommendations.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical condition that often presents a
      therapeutic challenge. There is no standard therapy and a multilevel approach is 
      recommended. A high-fiber diet is often one of these components. Many
      investigators have studied the effectiveness of either fiber supplementation or
      bulking agents in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this
      review is to summarize the current literature on the use of fiber in irritable
      bowel syndrome and to provide some specific recommendations. Systematic reviews
      of these trials have generally not found fiber to be significantly more effective
      than placebo at relieving global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. There may be 
      differences between results obtained with soluble and insoluble fiber. Adverse
      effects of fiber use may include abdominal discomfort and bloating. Although
      dietary fiber or bulking agents do not appear to be useful as sole treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome, they may have a limited role in empiric therapy
      depending upon the patient's symptom complex, especially if constipation is the
      most significant symptom. The basic principles for using fiber therapy are to
      start with a low dose and increase slowly, to give an adequate trial and to
      evaluate the results early and periodically.

TI  - Diet and functional gastrointestinal disorders: a population-based case-control
      study.
PG  - 2743-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet has been implicated to play a role in functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in clinic-based studies. No population-based
      data comparing food and nutrient consumption between individuals with FGID and
      without gastrointestinal symptoms are available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this 
      study was to compare the dietary consumption of specific food items and nutrients
      between individuals with FGID and without symptoms in a population-based sample. 
      METHODS: A validated self-report Bowel Disease Questionnaire was mailed to an
      age- and gender-stratified random sample of participants aged 20-50 yr from
      Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients who reported either FGID symptoms
      (irritable bowel or dyspepsia) or no gastrointestinal symptoms were invited to
      undergo a blinded physician interview and physical exam and to complete a
      validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and
      logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 222 of
      the 260 eligible (85%) subjects participated and 218 provided diet data: 99 were 
      FGID cases and 119 were healthy controls. Cases and controls consumed similar
      number of servings per week of wheat-containing foods, lactose-containing foods, 
      caffeinated drinks, and fructose-sweetened beverages. Cases were slightly more
      likely to consume >or=7 servings per week of norepinephrine- and
      epinephrine-containing foods (57%vs 45%, p= 0.10), but not serotonin- or
      tryptophan-containing foods. No differences were observed for amount of intake of
      calories, fiber, protein, iron, calcium, niacin, and vitamins C, D, E, niacin,
      B(1), B(2), B(6), and B(12). Cases reported consuming more fat (median, 33%vs
      31%) and less carbohydrates (median, 49%vs 52%) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: No
      differences were seen in the consumption of frequently suspected "culprit" foods 
      between community residents with and without FGID symptoms. While symptoms may be
      due to food sensitivity rather than altered diet composition, the role of fat and
      perhaps norepinephrine and epinephrine in foods in gut symptoms needs to be
      studied further.

TI  - Perceived food intolerance in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome-- etiology, 
      prevalence and consequences.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study estimates the prevalence of perceived food intolerance and
      its consequences in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), evaluates the
      utility of common tests for food intolerance, studies the relation between
      perceived food intolerance and other disorders, and discusses the etiology.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National health survey. SUBJECTS: A
      selection of the population (n=11,078) in Oppland county, Norway, was invited to 
      a health screening, and a sample of subjects with IBS were included in the study.
      INTERVENTIONS: A medical history of food intolerance, musculoskeletal pain, mood 
      disorders and abdominal complaints was taken, and tests were performed for food
      allergy and malabsorption. A dietician evaluated the dietary habits of the
      subjects. RESULTS: Out of 4,622 subjects with adequately filled-in
      questionnaires, 84 were included in the study, 59 (70%) had symptoms related to
      intake of food, 62% limited or excluded food items from the diet and 12% had an
      inadequate diet. The mean numbers of food items related to symptoms and the
      number of foods limited or excluded from the diet were 4.8 and 2.5, respectively.
      There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption
      and perceived food intolerance. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to
      musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food intolerance 
      is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population
      with IBS. The uselessness of current antibody tests and tests for malabsorption
      and the lack of correlation to psychiatric co-morbidity make the etiology
      obscure.

TI  - Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) concentration in plasma is not affected in
      functional abdominal pain in children.
PG  - 257-60
AB  - PURPOSE: Cholecystokinin regulates gut motility and visceral sensation. The aim
      of the study was to determine the diagnostic value of plasma cholecystokinin
      octapeptide (CCK-8) concentration in children with functional abdominal pain
      (FAP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two children (33 girls and 19 boys) aged 6-17 
      years with chronic abdominal pain were included in this study. On the basis of
      clinical data, results of endoscopy and Criteria for Functional Disorders the
      patients were divided into three groups: group 1--functional dyspepsia (FD),
      group 2--irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), group 3--non-specific FAP. The control
      group consisted of children without abdominal pain in anamnesis. CCK-8
      concentrations in plasma were measured with radio immunoassay technique, after
      plasma extraction. In study protocol we analysed CCK-8 levels in fasting state
      and 15, 30, 60 minutes after a standard test meal. RESULTS: In the fasting state 
      plasma levels of CCK-8 were similar in each group and in controls. In the IBS
      patients CCK-8 levels were not increased after meal. In groups 1, 3 and controls 
      postprandial levels were higher when compared to fasting state (p<0.05). Area
      under curve of CCK-8 plasma concentration was the lowest in group 2, but not
      significant compared to controls and other groups. No correlation was found
      between main symptoms of FD and IBS and CCK-8 concentration in plasma.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that gut dysmotility and symptoms of functional
      abdominal pain in children are not concerned with alteration of plasma CCK-8
      levels before and after meal.

TI  - Celiac disease: evaluation of the diagnosis and dietary compliance in Canadian
      children.
PG  - e754-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as
      well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance
      with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY
      DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed
      with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac
      disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS:
      The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age
      at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms
      included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%),
      nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%).
      Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation
      of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses
      received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%),
      gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A
      serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in
      this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a
      first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported 
      strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions 
      after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5
      and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included
      abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%),
      headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although
      most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major
      disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time
      about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the
      time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. 
      More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time.
      Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate
      stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding
      gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three
      percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian
      Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent
      information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When
      asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling
      of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in
      the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier
      diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%.
      CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a
      variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common.
      Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children
      experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods
      remain difficult to obtain.

TI  - Significance of salicylate intolerance in diseases of the lower gastrointestinal 
      tract.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced
      pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an
      organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or
      inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or
      life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local
      disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the
      characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of
      gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University.
      On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of
      chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID
      intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to
      clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.)
      including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory
      bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When
      presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these 
      symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility
      of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic,
      diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.

TI  - The association of gastrointestinal symptoms with weight, diet, and exercise in
      weight-loss program participants.
PG  - 992-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies on the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI)
      symptoms and obesity are limited. Research on the relationship between GI
      symptoms (including irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), weight, and weight-related
      behaviors are rare. This study assessed rates of GI symptoms in a sample of obese
      patients in a weight-loss program and explored relationships among GI symptoms
      and obesity, binge eating, dieting (fat and fruit/fiber consumption), and
      physical activity. METHODS: A total of 983 participants (70% women) had a mean
      body mass index (BMI) of 33.2+/-5.7 kg/m2 (range, 25.1-60.8 kg/m2) and a mean age
      of 52.7+/-12.4 years (range, 20.4-89.8 y). Participants completed a questionnaire
      about diet and physical activity and a standardized self-report Rome II
      questionnaire assessing IBS status and GI symptoms. RESULTS: In bivariate
      analyses BMI was associated positively with abdominal pain and diarrhea whereas
      healthier diet (lower fat and higher fruit/fiber intake) and higher physical
      activity were associated with fewer GI symptoms. In multivariate models BMI was
      not associated with GI symptoms; physical activity remained a protective factor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although physiologic mechanisms still need to be explored,
      associations between GI symptoms and diet and exercise behaviors may have
      implications for the treatment of both obesity and GI symptoms.

TI  - Food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 708-11
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common and likely a
      multifactorial gastrointestinal disorder in which a disturbed brain-gut axis has 
      been thought to have a mandatory role. Recent clinical and experimental studies
      imply that dietary factors may be more important in the pathogenesis of irritable
      bowel syndrome than was earlier anticipated. The purpose of this review is to
      present those studies and discuss their findings in relation to the crosstalk
      between the gastrointestinal immune and nervous systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Food
      elimination based on serum immunoglobulin G antibodies in irritable bowel
      syndrome has been found to result in a significant decrease in symptoms, compared
      with diets in which dietary restrictions are not guided by those antibodies. Both
      numbers of mast cells and their mediators have been shown to be increased in
      intestinal mucosa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, especially in the
      close proximity of intestinal nerves. Animal studies have demonstrated that this 
      increase in intestinal mast cell density could be a consequence of local
      hypersensitivity to food antigens. That kind of local gastrointestinal
      hypersensitivity seems to be beyond the reach of current diagnostic methods
      available in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Dietary factors may significantly
      contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. Elimination diets 
      based on the detection of local food hypersensitivity may offer a treatment
      option for irritable bowel syndrome patients in the future.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a probiotic combination VSL# 3 and placebo in
      irritable bowel syndrome with bloating.
PG  - 687-96
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of a combination probiotic on symptoms and colonic
      transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and significant bloating.
      METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Rome II IBS were randomized in a parallel
      group, double-blind design to placebo or VSL# 3 twice daily (31 patients received
      4 weeks and 17 patients 8 weeks of treatment). Pre- and post-treatment colonic
      transit measurements were performed using scintigraphy with (111)In charcoal.
      Symptoms were summarized as an average daily score for the entire period of
      treatment and separately for the first 4 weeks of treatment. Weekly satisfactory 
      relief of abdominal bloating was assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with VSL# 3 was
      associated with reduced flatulence over the entire treatment period (placebo 39.5
      +/- 2.6 vs VSL# 3 29.7 +/- 2.6, P = 0.011); similarly, during the first 4 weeks
      of treatment, flatulence scores were reduced (placebo 40.1 +/- 2.5 vs VSL# 3 30.8
      +/- 2.5, P = 0.014). Proportions of responders for satisfactory relief of
      bloating, stool-related symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating scores were not
      different. Colonic transit was retarded with VSL# 3 relative to placebo (colon
      geometric center 2.27 +/- 0.20 vs 2.83 +/- 0.19, P = 0.05 respectively).
      CONCLUSION: VSL# 3 reduces flatulence scores and retards colonic transit without 
      altering bowel function in patients with IBS and bloating.

TI  - [Determination of placebo effect in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 1934-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The determinants of the placebo effect are not well
      established. Goal of this study was to explore likely predictive factors in an
      already published data set. METHODS: We re-analysed data from a study in 120
      patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that were randomly assigned to
      three arms of the study to receive (double-blind) either a drug (mebeverin) (n = 
      40) or placebo (n = 40), or (in an open trial) dietary treatment (fibre) (n = 40)
      for up to 16 week. Treatment was conducted by 3 different doctors (A, B, C) with 
      44, 27, and 18 patients, resp. A fourth group (n = 31) was treated by different
      varying physicians. Symptoms were assessed every 4 weeks, and the degree of
      patient compliance and the number of drop-outs, the number of patients
      improved/not improved (in %), symptom severity (Kruis Score) at enrolment, and
      age and gender as covariates were included into the analysis. RESULTS: Drop-out
      rate was 30 % for placebo, 30 % for mebeverin, and 15 % for the diet. For the
      patients remaining in the study, average compliance was 75 % with placebo, but 89
      % for the drug and 82 % for the diet. Response rates were 39 % for placebo, but
      20 % for the drug; response rate for the diet (open trial) was 43 % under all
      doctors. Response rates for drug and placebo combined were 32 % for doctor A
      (female,43 years), but 19 % for doctors B and C together (both males, 32 and 40
      years)); this effect was not significant. Placebo responders were more often
      women (47 %) than men (28 %), while age effects were only found with dietary
      treatment: responders were younger. Placebo responders had an overall lower Kruis
      Score than non-responders (45 vs 52 points), but this was also true for drug (52 
      vs. 62 points) and diet responders (56 vs 68 points). CONCLUSION: The major
      factors contributing to the placebo response are the treating physician (gender, 
      training), and the patients gender (female). Patients with lower Kruis score
      (more likely non-functionally disordered) may be prone to higher (placebo)
      response rates.

TI  - Food-specific IgG4 antibody-guided exclusion diet improves symptoms and rectal
      compliance in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 800-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary modification improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). Identification of offending foods by dietary elimination/re-challenge is
      cumbersome. IgG4 antibodies to common food antigens are elevated in IBS. The aim 
      of this article was to evaluate the effect of exclusion diet based on IgG4 titres
      on IBS symptoms and rectal sensitivity and compliance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      study comprised 25 patients with IBS (3 M, 22 F, mean age 43 years, Rome II
      criteria). IgG4 titres to 16 foods (milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes,
      chicken, beef, pork, lamb, soya bean, fish, shrimps, yeast, tomatoes and peanuts)
      were measured. Foods with titres >250 microg/l were excluded for 6 months.
      Symptom severity was assessed with a previously validated questionnaire at
      baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months. Rectal compliance and sensitivity were
      measured in 12 patients at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: IgG4 antibodies to 
      milk, eggs, wheat, beef, pork and lamb were commonly elevated. Significant
      improvement was reported in pain severity (p < 0.001), pain frequency (p =
      0.034), bloating severity (p = 0.001), satisfaction with bowel habits (p = 0.004)
      and effect of IBS on life in general (p = 0.008) at 3 months. Symptom improvement
      was maintained at 6 months. Rectal compliance was significantly increased (p =
      0.011) at 6 months but the thresholds for urge to defecate/discomfort were
      unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Food-specific IgG4 antibody-guided exclusion diet
      improves symptoms in IBS and is associated with an improvement in rectal
      compliance.

TI  - A course of instruction for women with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 118-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects a course of
      instruction about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might have on symptoms,
      psychological well-being, and medical care requirements in these patients.
      METHODS: Twenty-nine women with IBS participated in a programme of instruction on
      medical care, physical activity, stress-management, diet and health insurance.
      The women completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the
      Psychological General Well-Being Index and provided information about their
      requirements of medical care before and after the course. RESULTS: Twenty-three
      of the women included, completed the questionnaires at 12 months after the
      course. When comparing these values to those at baseline, there were improvements
      in abdominal pain (p < 0.037) and vitality (p < 0.045) as well as a reduction in 
      the number of visits to physicians (p < 0.037) and dieticians (p < 0.042).
      CONCLUSION: Information related to the disease, might help women with IBS to
      perceive less pain and more vitality and thereby experience a higher quality of
      life. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A course of instruction for patients with IBS may be
      of benefit for the patients, and could be a part of a multicomponent approach in 
      the treatment of this patient group.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: state of the art.
PG  - 249-56
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder
      with a wide variety of presentations that may include abdominal pain, bloating,
      diarrhea, constipation, or alternating bowel habits. Symptom-based criteria and a
      limited medical evaluation are used for diagnosis. The heterogeneity of IBS
      presenting symptoms, together with the pathophysiology of the disorder, is
      unclear, making treatment challenging. Treatment strategies are focused on
      specific symptoms, potential underlying disorders in stress responsiveness, and
      predisposing psychological features. Although only two medications, tegaserod for
      constipation-predominant IBS and alosetron for diarrhea-predominant IBS, are
      specifically indicated, a wide variety of treatment options are available and are
      discussed in this review.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: a concise diagnostic and pharmacological therapy
      review].
PG  - 189-97
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) usually is considered a functional
      gastrointestinal disorder characterized by pain, bloating and either diarrhea or 
      constipation, but a small subgroup of patients report a sudden onset of their IBS
      symptoms after gastroenteritis, that is named postinfectious IBS. IBS can be
      diagnosed with confidence when a patient fulfills the Rome II criteria for IBS
      and displays no warning signs, as determined by a careful history and physical
      examination. In the past numerous test were considered routine for patients with 
      suspected IBS, however, available data do not support this approach. The etiology
      of IBS remains unknown and therefore the treatment is focused on relieving
      symptoms rather than curing the disease. The patient main complaints such as
      constipation, diarrhea or bloating-pain-gas, determine the therapies of choice,
      according the severity of them.

      medicine].
PG  - 32-7, 106
AB  - For many years the irritable bowel syndrome therapy was based only on an
      empirical approach. A lot of information has appeared for this period, which
      allows making a judgment about the efficacy of either of the ways of the
      functional bowel disorders treatment. A part of them was not approved in the
      course of clinical testing. At the same time, new high-performance ways of
      treatment appeared. This article presents an analytical survey of the irritable
      bowel syndrome pharmacotherapy. It also shows the role of diet, spasmolysants,
      psychotherapy, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, HT3
      antagonists and HT4 agonists.

TI  - Food-specific serum IgG4 and IgE titers to common food antigens in irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1550-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Food hypersensitivity is a common perception among irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) patients. Data from dietary elimination and food challenge studies
      support an etiopathological role of diet in IBS, but there are no
      well-established tests to identify food hypersensitivity. AIM: To compare IgG4
      and IgE titers to common food antigens in IBS and controls. METHOD: One hundred
      and eight IBS [52 diarrhea-predominant (D-IBS); 32 constipation-predominant
      (C-IBS); 24 alternating (Alt-IBS)], and 43 controls were included in the study.
      IgG4 and IgE titers and skin prick testing (SPT) to 16 common foods including
      milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish,
      shrimps, soya bean, yeast, tomatoes, and peanuts were measured. RESULTS: IBS had 
      significantly higher IgG4 titers (mug/L) to wheat (395 IQR +/- 1,011 vs 0 IQR +/-
      285, p < 0.001), beef (1,079 IQR +/- 930 vs 617 IQR +/- 435, p < 0.001), pork
      (481 IQR +/- 379 vs 258 IQR +/- 496, p < 0.001), and lamb (241 IQR +/- 460 vs 167
      IQR +/- 232, p= 0.009) compared to controls. These differences were maintained
      across all three subgroups. The antibody titers to potatoes, rice, fish, chicken,
      yeast, tomato, and shrimps were not significantly different. No significant
      difference in IgE titers was observed between IBS and controls. SPT was positive 
      for only a single antigen in 5 of 56 patients tested with the same panel of
      foods. No correlation was seen between the pattern of elevated IgG4 antibody
      titers and patients' symptoms. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG4 antibodies to common foods 
      like wheat, beef, pork, and lamb are elevated in IBS patients. In keeping with
      the observation in other atopic conditions, this finding suggests the possibility
      of a similar pathophysiological role for IgG4 antibodies in IBS.

TI  - Coeliac disease in developing countries: Middle East, India and North Africa.
PG  - 351-8
AB  - Following the application of simple serological tests for the diagnosis of
      coeliac disease (CD) in the 1980s, it gradually became clear that the prevalence 
      of CD in different countries in the Middle East, North Africa and India is almost
      the same as that in Western countries. The prevalence of CD in at-risk
      populations in these regions is reported to range between 3 and 20% and the
      prevalence in people with type 1 diabetes is approximately 3-5%. Clinical
      manifestations of CD vary markedly with age, the duration and the extent of
      disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or 
      no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as it is in Europe. Wheat has been
      the major staple food in these regions for many centuries and it is possible that
      the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some
      degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms, which are misdiagnosed as
      irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. A high index 
      of suspicion for CD should be maintained in all developing countries for patients
      who present with chronic diarrhoea or iron deficiency anaemia. The best method
      for diagnosing CD in patients with diarrhoea is the panel of coeliac serological 
      tests followed by small-bowel biopsy. In the absence of supplies for a
      gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries, maintaining this diet represents a 
      real challenge to both patients and clinicians.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome in developing countries--a disorder of civilization or
      colonization?
PG  - 317-24
AB  - While irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the West, early studies suggest
      that the prevalence is low in developing countries. However, recent studies point
      to increasing prevalence in newly developed Asian economies. The presentation
      appears to differ from the West, with a lack of female predominance, a greater
      frequency of upper abdominal pain and defecatory symptoms perceived as being less
      bothersome. This difference, together with the preoccupation with organic
      disease, could explain why we may be missing IBS in Asia and also why excess
      surgery has been observed in some Asian countries. While a recent study from
      China, consistent with western studies, support an important role for infection
      and inflammation, early studies from India reporting no association between
      amoebic infection and IBS appear to dispute this observation. To reconcile these 
      seemingly contradictory observations, an hygiene hypothesis model is proposed.
      Exposure to a variety of microorganisms early in life could result in the
      colonization of the intestine with microflora that can respond more efficiently
      to an episode of gastroenteritis. Together with the changes with evolution of
      Asian economies such as westernization of the diet and increased psychosocial
      stress, it is proposed that loss of this internal protective effect, could give
      rise to a more uniform worldwide prevalence of IBS.

TI  - Potential future therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: will disease modifying
      therapy as opposed to symptomatic control become a reality?
PG  - 337-54
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome can remit spontaneously, implying cure is possible.
      Predictors of good prognosis include a short history, acute onset(possibly
      postinfective origin), absence of psychological disorders, and resolution of
      chronic life stressors. Possible-disease modifying treatments with long-lasting
      effects include diet and anti-inflammatory and psychological treatments. Dietary 
      modifications, which often involve excluding dairy and wheat products, are
      successful in some patients. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been subjected to 
      one RCT in postinfective IBS without benefit. Probiotics may have benefit in
      altering bacterial flora and as anti-inflammatory agents, but further trials are 
      needed before they can be recommended. Psychological treatments may produce
      long-lasting responses. Relaxation therapy appears to have a nonspecific benefit.
      Psychotherapy has been shown to have long-term benefit and is particularly
      acceptable to, and effective for, those with overt psychological distress.
      Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in randomized placebo controlled
      trials and has a sustained effect.

TI  - The role of food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 247-55
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome patients frequently believe that food intolerances are
      to blame for many of their symptoms, although not uncommonly this is caused by
      the nonspecific increase in gut motility that occurs with food ingestion.
      Nevertheless, dietary manipulation may result in substantial improvement in IBS
      symptomatology provided it is individualized to the particular patient. By
      further understanding the mechanisms involved in dietary intolerance, it should
      be possible to optimize the benefits of this approach to treatment.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) a common worldwide problem,
      particularly women, and presents from the teenage years onward. OBJECTIVE: This
      article discusses the causes, diagnosis and management of IBS. DISCUSSION:
      Disturbed motility and sensory function underlie much of the disturbance in
      function that, not infrequently, begins following an episode of gastroenteritis. 
      There is an intimate role for the brain-gut axis in modulating symptoms relating 
      to underlying causes of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, food intolerance and
      sensitivity, and abnormalities of corticotropin releasing factors. Management
      requires long term involvement with the patient as there is no single therapeutic
      strategy that is predictably effective. However, diet, bulking agents,
      antispasmodics and a variety of alternative therapies including herbs,
      probiotics, and psychological intervention are important in individual patients.

TI  - Do interventions which reduce colonic bacterial fermentation improve symptoms of 
      irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 758-66
AB  - Abnormal fermentation may be an important factor in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). Gastroenteritis or antibiotic therapy may damage the colonic microflora,
      leading to increased fermentation and the accumulation of gas. Gas excretion may 
      be measured by whole-body calorimetry but there has only been one such study on
      IBS to date. We aimed to assess the relationship between IBS symptoms and
      fermentation rates in IBS. A purpose-built, 1.4-m3, whole-body calorimeter was
      used to assess excretion of H2 and CH4 in IBS subjects while consuming a standard
      diet and, again, after open randomization on either the standard diet together
      with the antibiotic metronidazole or a fiber-free diet to reduce fermentation.
      Metronidazole significantly reduced the 24-hr excretion of hydrogen (median value
      compared to the control group, 397 vs 230 ml/24 hr) and total gas (H2 + CH4; 671 
      vs 422 ml/min) and the maximum rate of gas excretion (1.6 vs 0.8 ml/min), as did 
      a no-fiber polymeric diet (hydrogen, 418 vs 176 ml/min; total gas, 564 vs 205
      ml/min; maximum rate of gas excretion, 1.35 vs 0.45 ml/min), with a significant
      improvement in abdominal symptoms. IBS may be associated with rapid excretion of 
      gaseous products of fermentation, whose reduction may improve symptoms.

TI  - Coeliac disease in South Asians resident in Britain: comparison with white
      Caucasian coeliac patients.
PG  - 541-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The catchment population of our hospital is ethnically diverse and we
      have seen a number of patients of South Asian origin with coeliac disease. We
      have suspected that there are differences compared with white Caucasian coeliacs,
      especially with respect to iron-deficiency anaemia and vitamin D deficiency at
      presentation. AIMS: To compare the clinical and laboratory features of South
      Asian adult coeliac patients with adult white Caucasian coeliacs. METHODS: We
      reviewed the notes of patients attending the adult coeliac clinic over the past
      10 years. All patients were older than 16 years at diagnosis. There were 40 South
      Asians and 90 white Caucasians. Symptoms, haematology, biochemistry, endomysial
      antibody status, HLA alleles and small bowel histology at presentation were
      compared between the two racial groups. RESULTS: There were significant
      differences between the racial groups. South Asians were younger at presentation 
      than the Caucasian patients (mean age 27 years compared with 47 years
      respectively, P<0.0001); they were less likely to have 'irritable bowel syndrome'
      symptoms (P<0.01), but more likely to have features of vitamin D deficiency
      (P<0.03). Their haemoglobin (P<0.05), mean cell volume (P<0.0004), serum iron
      (P<0.01), transferrin saturation (P<0.05), serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
      (P<0.002), and levels were lower, while serum alkaline phosphatase levels were
      higher (P<0.04) than in white Caucasian coeliac patients. There were no
      differences with respect to serum folate, vitamin B12, serum calcium, alanine
      aminotransferase and small bowel histology. IgA class endomysial antibody
      positivity was similar in the two groups (88.5% for South Asians compared with
      73.5% for white Caucasians). White Caucasian patients were significantly more
      likely to be DQ2-positive than the South Asian patients (97.2% compared with
      83.3%, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: South Asians with coeliac disease are less likely to 
      present with 'irritable bowel syndrome' symptoms, but more likely to have
      features of vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency, and have a higher alkaline 
      phosphatase than white Caucasians. The differences in HLA alleles seen in South
      Asians with coeliac disease compared with white Caucasian patients suggests that 
      among the South Asians, non-HLA regions may play a stronger role in disease
      susceptibility and presentation.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and symptom management.
PG  - 118-22
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common problem affecting 10% of the
      population at some time. Its cause and pathogenesis, however, remain poorly
      understood. Diagnosis is usually straightforward and detailed investigations are 
      only required when the presentation is atypical. Treating IBS is always a
      challenge. The concerns and expectations of the patient must be met, along with
      any associated psychosocial issues. Medication on its own without addressing all 
      of these issues is usually unsuccessful.

TI  - Abnormalities of 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonists improve
      symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS), 
      5-HT 4 agonists help those with constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). These data 
      suggest excess or deficiency in 5-HT in D-IBS or C-IBS, respectively. Mucosal
      5-HT-containing enterochromaffin cells (EC) are increased in postinfectious IBS
      (PI-IBS). Our aim was to define the postprandial release of 5-HT in PI-IBS and
      C-IBS patients and to relate this to mucosal 5-HT turnover. METHODS: Fifteen
      PI-IBS patients with diarrhea-predominant symptoms, 15 C-IBS patients, and 15
      healthy controls underwent serial (platelet-poor) plasma 5-HT measurement for 3
      hours after a standard 520-kcal meal. Rectal biopsy specimens were assayed for
      5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Colonic transit was
      measured using radio-opaque markers. RESULTS: Colonic transit was prolonged in
      C-IBS patients (mean +/- SEM) (49.4 +/- 3.8 h) compared with PI-IBS (26.7 +/-
      4.5) and control patients (34.1 +/- 4.5) ( P < .02). Release of 5-HT assessed by 
      area under the curve (AUC) of platelet-poor plasma 5-HT from 0 to 180 minutes
      postprandially was significantly lower in C-IBS patients (2593 +/- 309 mmol/L .
      min) compared with P-IBS (5623 +/- 721) and control patients (4822 +/- 598) ( P <
      .001). PI-IBS patients showed significantly higher peak postprandial plasma 5-HT 
      values (median, range) (71.7, 43.4-125.3) ng/L compared with C-IBS patients
      (31.2, 15.2-40.5) and control patients (43.6, 26.7-50.1) ( P < .01). Mucosal 5-HT
      turnover as assessed by mucosal 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was decreased in both C-IBS and
      PI-IBS patients, .14 (.01-.6) and .21 (.02-2.5), respectively, compared with
      control patients 1.12 (.17-3.1) ( P < .002). CONCLUSIONS: C-IBS patients show
      impaired postprandial 5-HT release whereas PI-IBS patients have higher peak
      levels, abnormalities that may be related to their different symptoms.

TI  - Use of diet and probiotic therapy in the irritable bowel syndrome: analysis of
      the literature.
PG  - S243-6
AB  - GOAL: The goal of this report is to review the use of dietary intake and
      probiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in published reports. 
      BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can be important in inducing symptoms that occur in
      patients with the IBS. Dietary intolerances, dietary allergies, specific food
      metabolites, and regular diet contents all may act as triggers and aggravate the 
      symptoms of IBS; but when any of these mechanisms can be proven to cause the
      symptoms, then their elimination results in the resolution of that patient's IBS.
      METHODS: Our previous review was updated. In addition, a careful Medline search
      was made for the years from 1975 to 2004 to evaluate human research reports on
      diet and probiotics in the IBS. Forty-six manuscripts were reviewed on diet and
      six were available on probiotic use in IBS. The most common dietary factor
      evaluated in the literature was bran, and the most common probiotic used was
      Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSIONS: Although investigations have shown that
      bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does
      not reveal conclusive evidence that diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the
      limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing
      symptoms. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both
      dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.

TI  - Systemic lactose intolerance: a new perspective on an old problem.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - Intolerance to certain foods can cause a range of gut and systemic symptoms. The 
      possibility that these can be caused by lactose has been missed because of
      "hidden" lactose added to many foods and drinks inadequately labelled, confusing 
      diagnosis based on dietary removal of dairy foods. Two polymorphisms, C/T13910
      and G/A22018, linked to hypolactasia, correlate with breath hydrogen and symptoms
      after lactose. This, with a 48 hour record of gut and systemic symptoms and a six
      hour breath hydrogen test, provides a new approach to the clinical management of 
      lactose intolerance. The key is the prolonged effect of dietary removal of
      lactose. Patients diagnosed as lactose intolerant must be advised of "risk"
      foods, inadequately labelled, including processed meats, bread, cake mixes, soft 
      drinks, and lagers. This review highlights the wide range of systemic symptoms
      caused by lactose intolerance. This has important implications for the management
      of irritable bowel syndrome, and for doctors of many specialties.

TI  - Randomised-controlled trial of a fibre supplement on the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of coarse wheat bran on specific
      bowel function parameters and symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS). A longitudinal, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was
      undertaken. The duration of treatment was eight to 12 weeks and this consisted of
      10-20 g/day of coarse wheat bran or a low fibre placebo taken in addition to the 
      normal diet. Twenty-eight outpatients fulfilling the Rome criteria for
      constipation-predominant IBS were recruited to the trial (14 in the treatment
      group; 14 in the placebo group). Twelve people completed the trial in the
      treatment group and ten in the placebo group. The main outcome measures included 
      changes in symptoms recorded in a diary, changes in objective measurements of
      bowel function and subjective overall feelings of improvement. The bran group
      significantly increased their non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) intake over that of
      the placebo group (p < 0.05). Mean stool wet weight increased significantly more 
      in the bran group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05), but other bowel function 
      measurements and all recorded symptoms were not different. Many patients reported
      changes in bowel habit that were not reflected in the objective measurements. The
      addition of coarse wheat bran to the diet increased NSP ingestion and stool wet
      weight in this group of IBS patients, but no evidence was obtained that such
      treatment was of benefit to these patients, other than a placebo effect on
      symptoms.

TI  - A non-dairy probiotic's (poi) influence on changing the gastrointestinal tract's 
      microflora environment.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora
      adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are 
      probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts
      confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain
      health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a
      Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro
      plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of
      poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the
      gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study
      included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and
      control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week
      washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 
      4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as 
      their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed
      fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2
      cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary
      records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and
      post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no
      significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus
      following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of
      specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is
      analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not
      alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet
      feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus,
      Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency
      or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods.
      CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual
      bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might
      determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2
      days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations
      may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.

TI  - Yeast metabolic products, yeast antigens and yeasts as possible triggers for
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - Many patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are disillusioned by the lack
      of efficacy of treatments and suffer from numerous symptoms not covered by the
      Rome criteria for IBS, as the current empirical treatment regimens fail to
      address these persistent debilitating 'IBS associated symptoms'. These symptoms
      are similar to other symptom complexes like chronic fatigue and the so-called
      'candida syndrome', and many seek help from alternative medicine. The possible
      role of Candida and yeasts in non-immune compromised individuals is disputed and 
      is the subject of this review. Even if the involvement of yeasts in the aetiology
      of IBS still remains unclear, there is increasing evidence for yeasts being able 
      to cause IBS-symptoms in sensitized patients via Candida products, antigens and
      cross-antigens. But more research is needed before antifungal treatment can be
      recommended as a first line treatment for IBS.

TI  - The value of a general therapeutic approach in subjects with irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The general therapeutic approach is the cornerstone in the management
      of irritable bowel syndrome, but the effect is poorly documented. AIM: To
      evaluate the effect of the general therapeutic approach for irritable bowel
      syndrome. METHODS: Subjects with irritable bowel syndrome identified in a public 
      screening were included. Scores for abdominal symptom (range 0-12),
      musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders were calculated. After exclusion of other
      disorders, a doctor presented irritable bowel syndrome as a positive diagnosis,
      gave information, reassurance and lifestyle advice, but no pharmacotherapy. A
      dietician gave dietary advice. There was a follow-up after 6 months. RESULTS:
      Sixty-five persons (females/males: 44/21) with mean age 49 years (range 31-76)
      were included, 31 (48%) were recommended dietary changes. Twenty subjects (31%)
      had satisfactory relief of symptoms after 6 months. The scores for abdominal
      symptom was reduced from 3.1 to 2.2 (P = 0.007), the reduction was 2.2 in the
      diarrhoea-predominant group given advice compared with 0.4 in the other subjects 
      (P = 0.035). Previous consultations for the complaints, visits for psychiatric
      disorders, and presence of mood disorders were predictors of persistent
      complaints. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant relief of symptoms after 6
      months, those with psychological co-morbidity responded less well. The effect of 
      dietary advice was only seen in those with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel 
      syndrome.
