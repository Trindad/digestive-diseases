AB  - There is an undeniable link between gastrointestinal disorders and malnutrition. 
      Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions that can 
      impact a patient's nutritional status. The nutritional consequences will depend
      on the cause of the diarrhoea as well as the location and extent of
      gastrointestinal involvement. In general, malabsorption plays a central role in
      the interaction between malnutrition and chronic diarrhoea. Malabsorption can
      result in both nutritional deficits and diarrhoea. With severe malnutrition,
      chronic diarrhoea can persist due to impaired immune function and poor mucosal
      recovery. Food intolerance and an inappropriate diet in the setting of
      malabsorption may also contribute to chronic diarrhoea. Patients may attribute
      their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific dietary intake, which can lead to
      self-imposed indiscriminate dietary restrictions. Therefore, disease-specific
      treatment in conjunction with appropriate nutritional counselling and
      intervention is recommended in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in
      patients with chronic diarrhoea. Specialized nutritional support through enteral 
      or parenteral administration may be required to treat severe caloric and
      micronutrient deficiencies. In this review, we aim to summarize the mechanism,
      diagnosis, and treatment of the nutritional consequences of chronic diarrhoea.

LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Diet and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent papers highlight the role of the diet in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), but very few population-based studies have evaluated this. 
      The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of IBS in the general urban 
      population and to evaluate the type of diet associated with IBS symptoms.
      METHODS: A randomized sample of subjects (n=300) from a general urban population 
      in Romania selected from family doctors' patient lists was invited for interview 
      in the doctor's office. Selected subjects were evaluated for the diagnosis of IBS
      using Rome III criteria and for their eating habits and diet using a food
      frequency questionnaire. Socio-demographic factors and general medical history
      were also included in the interview together with standard weight measurements.
      Results from logistic regression were presented as odd ratios and 95 % confidence
      intervals. RESULTS: From the selected sample, 193 subjects (80 males, 113 women, 
      mean age 50.8 +/- 16.2) agreed to participate (rate 64.3%). Prevalence of IBS was
      19.1 % (19.4% for females and 18.7 % for males). IBS was associated with older
      age (1.05, 1.02-1.08, p <0.001) and past history of digestive diseases (5.0,
      2.0-12.7, p<0.01). IBS subjects eat significantly more frequently canned food
      (23.74, 3.17-177.7, p<0.01), processed meat (4.7, 1.6-14.1, p<0.01), pulses
      (legumes) (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.01), whole cereals (8.7, 2.0-37.8, p<0.01),
      confectionary (5.7, 1.8-23.2, p<0.01), fruit compotes (canned or not) (7.4,
      2.5-23.1, p<0.001) and herb teas (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study updates prevalence data and reveals a possible association between diet and
      irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of lactase deficiency on digestive symptoms and
      diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not been well defined. 
      We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in 
      healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS).
      METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital,
      Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect
      malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in
      random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the
      dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose
      intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of
      controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS 
      were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 
      1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; 
      P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients
      with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 
      95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However,
      self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests.
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and
      intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported 
      LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with
      avoidance of dairy products.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report symptoms
      compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the prevalence of these 
      symptoms in patients with CD and their relation to adherence to a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) have not been assessed systematically. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) to identify cross-sectional
      surveys or case-control studies reporting prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in
      adult patients (>/= 16 years old) with established CD. The number of individuals 
      with symptoms meeting criteria for IBS was extracted for each study, according to
      case or control status and adherence to a GFD. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios 
      (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. We analyzed data
      from 7 studies with 3383 participants. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of IBS-type
      symptoms in all patients with CD was 38.0% (95% CI, 27.0%-50.0%). The pooled OR
      for IBS-type symptoms was higher in patients with CD than in controls (5.60; 95% 
      CI, 3.23-9.70). In patients who were nonadherent with a GFD, the pooled OR for
      IBS-type symptoms, compared with those who were strictly adherent, was 2.69 (95% 
      CI, 0.75-9.56). There was also a trend toward a higher OR for IBS-type symptoms
      among patients who did not adhere to the GFD, compared with controls (12.42; 95% 
      CI, 6.84-11.75), compared with that observed for adherent CD patients vs controls
      (4.28; 95% CI, 1.56-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-type symptoms occur frequently in
      patients with CD and are more common than among controls. Adherence to a GFD
      might be associated with a reduction in symptoms.

LID - 10.1007/s10354-012-0158-0 [doi]
AB  - Meteorism, abdominal spasms, diarrhea, casually obstipation, flatulence and
      nausea are symptoms of fructose malabsorption (FIT) and/or lactose intolerance
      (LIT), but are also symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore these
      diseases should be considered primarily in patients with digestive complaints.
      For diagnosis an H(2)-breath test is used.In 1,935 patients (526 m, 1,409 f) a
      fructose intolerance test and in 1,739 patients (518 m,1,221 f) a lactose
      intolerance test was done.FIT is found more frequently than LIT (57 versus 52 %
      in adults (p < 0,02) and in children 90 versus 62 % (p < 0,001)) and is in
      polyintolerances most frequently correlated to histamine intolerance (HIT).
      Headache (ca. 10 %), fatigue (ca. 5 %) and dizziness (ca. 3 %) may occur after
      the test, irrespective whether the test was positive or negative.In more than 2/3
      of patients a diet reduced in fructose or lactose may lead to improvement or
      remission of these metabolic disorders. IBS, which is often correlated with FIT
      (183/221 patients = 83 %), can be improved by relevant but also not relevant
      diets indicating that irritable bowel disease seems to be caused primarily by
      psychological disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapeutic potential of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based
      elimination diet among migraine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      BACKGROUND: Food elimination has been suggested as an effective and inexpensive
      therapeutic strategy in patients with migraine and concomitant IBS in the past
      studies. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 38.0
      [11.2] years; 85.7% females) diagnosed with migraine and IBS were included in
      this double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial composed of 
      baseline (usual diet), first diet (elimination or provocation diets), and second 
      diet (interchange of elimination or provocations diets) phases and 4 visits.
      RESULTS: IgG antibody tests against 270 food allergens revealed mean (standard
      deviation) reaction count to be 23.1 (14.1). Compared with baseline levels,
      elimination diet per se was associated with significant reductions in attack
      count (4.8 [2.1] vs 2.7 [2.0]; P < .001), maximum attack duration (2.6 [0.6] vs. 
      1.4 [1.1] days; P < .001), mean attack duration (1.8 [0.5] vs. 1.1 [0.8] days; P 
      < .01), maximum attack severity (visual analog scale 8.5 [1.4] vs. visual analog 
      scale 6.6 [3.3]; P < .001), and number of attacks with acute medication (4.0
      [1.5] vs. 1.9 [1.8]; P < .001). There was a significant reduction in
      pain-bloating severity (1.8 [1.3] vs. 3.2 [0.8]; P < .05), pain-bloating within
      the last 10 days (3.2 [2.8] vs. 5.5 [3.1]; P < .05), and improvement obtained in 
      quality of life (3.6 [1.4] vs. 2.9 [1.0]; P < .05) by the elimination diet as
      compared with provocation diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that food
      elimination based on IgG antibodies in migraine patients who suffer from
      concomitant IBS may effectively reduce symptoms from both disorders with possible
      positive impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as potential
      savings to the health-care system.

TI  - Non-celiac wheat sensitivity: separating the wheat from the chat!
PG  - 1908-12
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.344 [doi]
AB  - Historically, it has been reported that patients with undetected celiac disease
      (CD) may present with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) type symptoms. This has led 
      to the recommendation by the American College of Gastroenterology Task force that
      patients presenting with diarrhea predominant IBS type symptoms should be
      serologically tested for CD. Concurrently speculative media data suggest that the
      US general public have increased their uptake of a gluten-free diet (GFD) far in 
      excess of the known prevalence of CD. This may suggest that individuals with
      gastrointestinal symptoms are deriving benefit from a GFD even if they do not
      have CD. This has led to the scientific community considering the evidence for an
      emerging concept of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. There is a significant
      disparity in our views about what this phenomenon may be. There is also confusion
      about the nomenclature for this entity and indeed whether patients are suffering 
      due to symptoms related to gluten or perhaps other components of wheat, for
      example fructans. In this month's edition of the American Journal of
      Gastroenterology, we see evidence to support the clinical concept of wheat
      sensitivity or intolerance. Irrespective of the nomenclature Carroccio provides a
      clinically applicable approach that may be adopted internationally by clinicians.
      This offers a new option in our armamentarium when seeing patients with IBS type 
      symptoms.

TI  - IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome: a case control
      study in the general population.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often relate their
      symptoms to the intake of food and modify their diet. IgE-mediated food allergy
      is uncommon in IBS, but the role of IgG-mediated food hypersensitivity remains
      inconclusive. The primary aim of this study was to compare food- and
      yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with and without IBS. METHODS:
      This was a case control study in the general population for which subjects
      completed questionnaires about abdominal complaints and their intake of common
      food items. Blood samples were collected, and food- and yeast-specific IgG and
      IgG4 antibodies were measured. Antibodies were measured in mg/L. RESULTS: We
      included 269 subjects with IBS and 277 control subjects. After correction for
      subject characteristics and diet, there were no significant differences with
      regard to food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies between subjects with 
      IBS and controls. Lower values of IgG antibodies against egg (OR 0.99 (0.98 to
      1.00), p = 0.002) and beef (OR 0.75 (0.60 to 0.94), p = 0.012) and higher values 
      of IgG antibodies against chicken (OR 1.14 (1.03 to 1.27), p = 0.009) were
      associated with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that
      IgG-and IgG4-mediated food and yeast hypersensitivity in IBS is unlikely. IgG
      antibodies against food and yeast may reflect the diet.

TI  - Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and treatment of patients in 
      a pragmatic trial.
PG  - 1021-7
LID - 10.1089/acm.2011.0670 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatments delivered during 
      a pragmatic effectiveness study of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      and to explore the roles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnoses and
      preferences of the acupuncturists in treatment design. METHODS: Patients
      allocated to an acupuncture arm of a study were offered up to ten sessions of
      acupuncture over 3 months. Acupuncturists followed a flexible treatment protocol 
      that allowed for treatment individualization, use of additional therapies such as
      moxa, and provision of lifestyle advice. All treatments were recorded in logbooks
      and analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS: Seven primary and eight secondary TCM 
      patterns were identified among the 113 patients with IBS, and were combined in
      various ways to produce unique diagnoses for 84% patients. Liver Qi Stagnation
      and Damp Heat were the most commonly reported patterns. Of the 126 acupuncture
      points used, a distinct core and supporting group of points was associated with
      each primary pattern. Each practitioner also utilized a distinct core and
      supporting group of points that reflected his/her preferences. Use of additional 
      therapies (e.g., moxa) and provision of lifestyle advice (e.g., diet) were
      generally consistent with a particular practitioner. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest
      that a patient's TCM diagnosis, the practitioner's preferences, and a patient's
      individual characteristics beyond his/her diagnosis influence treatment delivery.
      In particular, TCM diagnoses appear to influence the acupuncture (i.e., point
      selection) aspect of treatment more than the selection of additional therapies
      and lifestyle advice. From another perspective, the treatments incorporated
      pragmatic, individualized, and disease-specific approaches with combinations that
      produced both treatment commonalities and diversities.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: diet and complementary medicine therapies?].
PG  - 430-5
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent and invalidating functional bowel
      disorder with entangled mechanisms. Its therapeutic approach is therefore
      complex. Classical therapies, prescribed alone or in combination in light of the 
      predominant symptom, consist of antispasmodics, fibers, laxatives,
      antidiarrheals, and psychotropic agents. Other emerging pharmacological
      therapies, such as prokinetics, prosecretory or serotoninergic agents, bile acid 
      modulators and antibiotics have been recently studied in clinical trials. Dietary
      measures can include reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (FODMAPs) and gluten restriction. Assessment of food allergy can be proposed in a
      subgroup of IBS patients. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies, that 
      are generally low cost and safe, appear to be appreciated by patients. Probiotics
      have demonstrated action on the gut microbiote modulation, and may be helpful in 
      a subset of patients. Peppermint oil has an established visceral analgesic
      effect. Hypnotherapy represents an original, global and effective approach.
      Finally, education, reassurance and listening to the patient, leading to a solid 
      therapeutic relationship, represents an essential backdrop of remedy or diet
      effectiveness.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal
      disorder that has a significant impact on quality of life and health care
      resources. Celiac disease (CD), a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, can be mistaken
      for IBS. This article discusses the connection between IBS and CD and the new
      concept of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). NCGS may occur in the presence of
      a normal or near-normal small bowel biopsy. Some patients with IBS without CD may
      derive symptomatic benefit from a gluten-free diet. Future research could
      facilitate a significant impact on the quality of life in this potential subgroup
      of patients.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and pathogenesis.
PG  - 5151-63

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that
      considerably reduces the quality of life. It further represents an economic
      burden on society due to the high consumption of healthcare resources and the
      non-productivity of IBS patients. The diagnosis of IBS is based on symptom
      assessment and the Rome III criteria. A combination of the Rome III criteria, a
      physical examination, blood tests, gastroscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies is
      believed to be necessary for diagnosis. Duodenal chromogranin A cell density is a
      promising biomarker for the diagnosis of IBS. The pathogenesis of IBS seems to be
      multifactorial, with the following factors playing a central role in the
      pathogenesis of IBS: heritability and genetics, dietary/intestinal microbiota,
      low-grade inflammation, and disturbances in the neuroendocrine system (NES) of
      the gut. One hypothesis proposes that the cause of IBS is an altered NES, which
      would cause abnormal GI motility, secretions and sensation. All of these
      abnormalities are characteristic of IBS. Alterations in the NES could be the
      result of one or more of the following: genetic factors, dietary intake,
      intestinal flora, or low-grade inflammation. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) and
      inflammatory bowel disease-associated IBS (IBD-IBS) represent a considerable
      subset of IBS cases. Patients with PI- and IBD-IBS exhibit low-grade mucosal
      inflammation, as well as abnormalities in the NES of the gut.

TI  - Prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in Taiwan:
      questionnaire-based survey for adults based on the Rome III criteria.
PG  - 594-600
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are a group of disorders of the
      digestive system in which the chronic or recurrent symptoms cannot be explained
      by the presence of structural or tissue abnormality. This survey used a modified 
      Rome III questionnaire on the health and nutrition status of a general population
      in Taiwan during 2005-2008. A total of 4,275 responders completed the
      questionnaire. The sample was evenly distributed for men (n=2,137) and women
      (n=2,138). The prevalence of FGID was 26.2%. Unspecified functional bowel
      disorder was the most prevalent (8.9%). The second was functional dyspepsia
      (5.3%), and the third were irritable bowel syndrome (4.4%) and functional
      constipation (4.4%). Women had a greater prevalence than males (33.2% compared to
      22.4%, p<0.05) with regards to total FGID. Most categories of FGID were
      significantly prominent in women, except functional diarrhea. The FGID groups
      took fewer servings of vegetables and fruits than the non-FGID group each day
      (vegetables 2.51 vs 2.70, p<0.001; fruits 0.82 vs 0.91, p<0.001). Smoking,
      alcohol consumption, and betel nut chewing had no significant impaction on
      prevalence of FGID. The mean BSRS (brief-symptom rating scale) for screening
      depression and suicide ideation was higher in the FGID group (2.86 vs 1.63,
      p<0.001). In conclusion, FGID diagnosed with Rome III criteria are not uncommon
      in Taiwan's general population. Subjects who met the Rome III criteria for FGID
      in Taiwan were younger, had less vegetables and fruits intake, higher BSRS scores
      and were of greater female predominance.

TI  - Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity
      and disease.
PG  - 1095-119
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside
      in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the
      human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must
      maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive
      to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory
      processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence
      suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence
      susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
      Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased
      incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early
      childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an
      alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant
      immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced
      dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will
      be discussed.

AB  - AIM: To investigate whether composite yogurt with acacia dietary fiber and
      Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) has additive effects in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A total of 130 patients were randomly allocated to
      consume, twice daily for 8 wk, either the composite yogurt or the control
      product. The composite yogurt contained acacia dietary fiber and high-dose B.
      lactis together with two classic yogurt starter cultures. Patients were evaluated
      using the visual analog scale via a structured questionnaire administered at
      baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in bowel habit satisfaction
      and overall IBS symptoms from baseline were significantly higher in the test
      group than in the control group (27.16 vs 15.51, P = 0.010, 64.2 +/- 17.0 vs 50.4
      +/- 20.5, P < 0.001; respectively). In constipation-predominant IBS, improvement 
      in overall IBS symptoms was significantly higher in the test group than in the
      control group (72.4 +/- 18.4 vs 50.0 +/- 21.8, P < 0.001). In patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS, improvement in bowel habit satisfaction from baseline
      was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (32.90 vs
      7.81, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that composite yogurt enriched
      with acacia fiber and B. lactis has greater therapeutic effects in patients with 
      IBS than standard yogurt.

TI  - Nutrient intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with the
      general population.
PG  - 23-30.e1
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS.
      Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to
      the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups
      based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate 
      if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187
      IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food
      registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control 
      group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic
      Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was 
      similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations.
      Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from
      macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended
      to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher
      daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well
      as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no
      association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food
      items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large
      extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency
      toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy
      products in IBS patients.

PG  - 66-9
AB  - Hygienic and dietology estimation of cereal breakfast (oat muesli and crispbread)
      were carried out on 137 irritable colon syndrome (SRK) patients with functional
      chronic constipation. It is established that inclusion of cereal breakfast in a
      diet of such patients positively influences on motor-evacuation function of
      digestive tract and promotes improvement of indicators of carbohydrate and lipid 
      metabolism. It is important for patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes.
      Positive improvements of research allow making a cereal breakfast use
      recommendations: muesli in number of 50 g/days (with milk or kefir), crispbread
      and crunchy snacks in number of 100 g/days in SRK patients with functional
      chronic constipation dietary nutrition.

TI  - A randomised clinical trial (RCT) of a symbiotic mixture in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): effects on symptoms, colonic transit and quality 
      of life.
PG  - 349-58
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1552-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised
      placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain
      symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is
      only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS.
      METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The
      primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and
      bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of
      treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in
      abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale,
      stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale
      and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time
      (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS
      patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were
      studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of
      treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of
      responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the
      treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in
      most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This
      symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of
      flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect
      profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory
      relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.

PG  - 624-35
LID - 10.1177/0884533612452012 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota 
      have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ
      principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ
      on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the
      identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the
      identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different
      species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of
      these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a
      balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced
      composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not
      only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with
      the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities
      have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases,
      including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory
      bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. Recognition of the strong potential for
      food to manipulate microbiota composition has opened up new therapeutic
      strategies against these diseases based on dietary intervention.

TI  - Autonomic nervous system activity in constipation-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome patients.
PG  - CR493-499
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main mechanism underlying irritable bowel syndrome is currently
      believed to be a dysfunction of the brain-gut axis. Autonomic nervous system
      dysfunction can contribute to development of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by
      disturbing visceral sensations. MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirty patients with a
      diagnosis of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and 30 healthy
      volunteers were included in the study. Resting and functional autonomic nervous
      system tests and percutaneous electrogastrography were performed. Plasma
      adrenalin, noradrenalin, insulin, ghrelin and cholecystokinin activity was
      analyzed. RESULTS: Increased sympathetic activation with disturbed
      parasympathetic function was demonstrated. Patients had substantially higher
      plasma catecholamine concentration, which confirms sympathetic overbalance.
      Hyperinsulinemia may explain sympathetic predominance followed by gastric and
      intestinal motility deceleration. Abnormal, reduced ghrelin and cholecystokinin
      titre may disturb brain-gut axis functioning and may be responsible for gastric
      motility deceleration. In electrogastrography, distinctly lower values of fasting
      normogastria percentage and dominant power were observed. Patients had
      substantially lower slow wave coupling percentage both in fasting and
      postprandial periods, which negatively correlated with plasma catecholamines
      level. Gastric myoelectrical activity disturbances may result from lack of
      sympatho-parasympathetic equilibrium. CONCLUSIONS: Central sympathetic influence 
      within the brain-gut axis is most probably responsible for myoelectrical activity
      disturbances in irritable bowel syndrome patients.

      malabsorption state?
PG  - 489-93
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328356662d [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the relevant publications during the last 12
      months supporting that diet can influence gas-related symptoms in the absence of 
      a malabsorption state. RECENT FINDINGS: Gas symptoms during carbohydrate
      fermentation: a diet incorporating beans is well tolerated by a majority of
      individuals involved in a program of heart disease biomarkers. By contrast, in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a diet avoiding fermentable carbohydrates
      improved gas-related abdominal symptoms. The rate of fermentation determines the 
      production of abdominal symptoms, and many slowly fermentable fibers have a rapid
      fermentation profile that can generate abdominal symptoms. Modulation of visceral
      sensitivity: diet can influence gas symptoms by increasing the tolerability of
      the intestine to gas. Capsaicin decreases visceral hyperalgesia and improved
      bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Changes in gas-producing
      bacteria: different strains of Lactobacillus have antimicrobial properties
      against gas-forming coliforms. New clinical studies show beneficial effects of
      prebiotics and probiotics on abdominal bloating. SUMMARY: Actual data suggest
      that diet could improve gas-related abdominal symptoms acting on several
      mechanisms: gas production, visceral hypersensitivity and modulation of
      gas-producing enteric bacteria.

      as compared to placebo on the symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), in participants who 
      initially experienced >30% remission of symptoms on an excitotoxin elimination
      diet. METHODS: Fifty-seven FM patients who also had irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) were placed on a 4-week diet that excluded dietary additive excitotoxins
      including MSG and aspartame. Thirty-seven people completed the diet and 84% of
      those reported that >30% of their symptoms resolved, thus making them eligible to
      proceed to challenges. Subjects who improved on the diet were then randomised to 
      a 2-week double-blind placebo-controlled crossover challenge with MSG or placebo 
      for 3 consecutive days each week. The primary outcome measure was total symptom
      score. Secondary outcome measures included visual analogue pain scales (VAS for
      FM and IBS), an IBS Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS QOL) and the Fibromyalgia 
      Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyse 
      crossover challenge results. RESULTS: The MSG challenge, as compared to placebo, 
      resulted in a significant return of symptoms (total symptom score, p<0.02); a
      worsening of fibromyalgia severity as determined by the FIQR (p<0.03); decreased 
      quality of life in regards to IBS symptoms (IBS QOL, p<0.05); and a
      non-significant trend toward worsening FM pain based on visual analogue scale
      (VAS, p<0.07). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dietary glutamate may be 
      contributing to FM symptoms in some patients. Future research on the role of
      dietary excitotoxins in FM is warranted.

AB  - Preliminary studies indicate that dietary restriction of fermentable short-chain 
      carbohydrates improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Prebiotic
      fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides stimulate colonic
      bifidobacteria. However, the effect of restricting fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has never been examined.
      This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of fermentable 
      carbohydrate restriction on luminal microbiota, SCFA, and GI symptoms in patients
      with IBS. Patients with IBS were randomized to the intervention diet or habitual 
      diet for 4 wk. The incidence and severity of symptoms and stool output were
      recorded for 7 d at baseline and follow-up. A stool sample was collected and
      analyzed for bacterial groups using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Of 41
      patients randomized, 6 were withdrawn. At follow-up, there was lower intake of
      total short-chain fermentable carbohydrates in the intervention group compared
      with controls (P = 0.001). The total luminal bacteria at follow-up did not differ
      between groups; however, there were lower concentrations (P < 0.001) and
      proportions (P < 0.001) of bifidobacteria in the intervention group compared with
      controls when adjusted for baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, more
      patients in the intervention group reported adequate control of symptoms (13/19, 
      68%) compared with controls (5/22, 23%; P = 0.005). This randomized controlled
      trial demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal
      bifidobacteria after 4 wk of fermentable carbohydrate restriction. Although the
      intervention was effective in managing IBS symptoms, the implications of its
      effect on the GI microbiota are still to be determined.

PG  - 159-76

AB  - It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important
      elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The
      most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a
      bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in
      the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the
      evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The
      introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major
      advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from
      16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and 
      qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS.
      Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS.
      The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal
      innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate
      nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we
      await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic
      target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics,
      probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although
      most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the
      authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the
      pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of
      microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on 
      modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.

      study.
PG  - 627-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study bowel patterns (function/habits) and its associated variables
      in an adult Saudi population. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, a 21-item
      questionnaire on bowel function (habits and frequency) was distributed to 10,000 
      high school students from all 5 regions of Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, between
      February and April 2011. The randomly selected students, and 2 of their household
      or family members completed the questionnaire. Socio-demographic characteristics,
      eating habits, chronic diseases, and medications used were studied. RESULTS:
      Sixty-one percent (N=4918) were above the age of 16 years, of which 51.5% were
      males, and 88.1% were Saudis. It was observed that 18.1% of respondents perceived
      their bowel movements as being irregular and abnormal. There was no association
      between gender and abnormal/irregular bowel movement (OR: 0.89; p=0.13).
      Individuals over 60 years suffered from bowel pattern abnormalities (OR=1.8;
      p=0.01). Educational status (secondary), occupation (teacher and unemployed),
      diet habits, and chronic diseases of study subjects were also statistically
      significantly associated with their bowel movements. Respondents consuming more
      vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy products, and rice had significantly more normal
      bowel movements. Females tended to defecate less frequently as compared with
      males (p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of both genders have bowel movements at least
      once a day. CONCLUSION: Our results may serve as a baseline for appropriate
      intervention strategies, and also for future studies to substantiate, negate, or 
      add more observations/conclusions.

AB  - The functional colopathies are frequent in digestive pathology and are
      particularly badly felt by African patients. The authors, after the determination
      of the masticatory efficiency score (classification of Verkindere) of 100
      subjects affected by colopathies and diagnosed in the service of gastroenterology
      of Cocody University Hospital (Abidjan), attempt to determine the importance of
      the masticatory deficiency in functional colopathies. Among the toothless
      subjects with functional colopathies, the restoration of the masticatory
      efficiency by functional prosthetic rehabilitation constitutes an essential
      therapeutic act in the reduction of the symptoms of the functional colopathies
      and the improvement of the comfort of the patients. Patients' global care raises 
      the interest of collaboration between odontologists and gastroenterologists for
      an efficient treatment.

      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 435-43

AB  - BACKGROUND: Manipulation of dietary fibre intake represents a longstanding
      treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly for
      those with constipation. Linseeds are often recommended by both clinicians and
      dietitians as a source of dietary fibre to alleviate symptoms. Recent guidance on
      the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) advises that linseeds may reduce
      wind and bloating, although there is limited clinical evidence to support this
      recommendation. The present pilot study aimed to compare the clinical
      effectiveness of: (i) whole linseeds versus ground linseeds; (ii) whole linseeds 
      versus no linseeds; and (iii) ground linseeds versus no linseeds in the
      management of IBS symptoms. METHODS: In an open randomised controlled trial,
      subjects with IBS (n = 40) were allocated to one of three intervention groups:
      two tablespoons of whole linseeds per day (n = 14), two tablespoons of ground
      linseeds per day (n = 13) and no linseeds as controls (n = 13). Symptom severity 
      (primary outcome) and bowel habit were assessed before and after a 4-week
      intervention and statistical differences between the groups were compared.
      RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the present study. Between-group analysis 
      comparing the improvement in symptom severity did not reach statistical
      significance for whole linseeds (n = 11) versus ground linseeds (n = 11; P =
      0.62), whole linseeds versus controls (n = 9; P = 0.12) and ground linseeds
      versus controls (P = 0.10). There were no significant changes in stool frequency 
      or stool consistency for any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linseeds may be useful
      in relief of IBS symptoms. Further research is needed to detect clear differences
      between the effects of whole and ground linseeds.

PG  - 812-33
LID - 10.3390/md10040812 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in
      inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis,
      diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease,
      Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the
      past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually
      the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may
      lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation
      of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an
      influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of
      the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is
      not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been
      implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the
      antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of
      oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing
      antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic
      substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related
      oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped
      reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for
      exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such 
      as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of
      health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic
      and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining
      attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory
      degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published
      studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of
      many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Diet in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome: a cross-sectional study in the
      general population.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-61 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often relate symptoms to
      the intake of certain foods. This study assesses differences in diet in subjects 
      with and without IBS. METHODS: The cross-sectional, population-based study was
      conducted in Norway in 2001. Out of 11078 invited subjects, 4621 completed a
      survey about abdominal complaints and intake of common food items. IBS and IBS
      subgroups were classified according to Rome II criteria. RESULTS: IBS was
      diagnosed in 388 subjects (8.4%) and, of these, 26.5% had
      constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), 44.8% alternating IBS (A-IBS), and 28.6%
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Low intake of dairy products (portions/day)
      (Odds Ratio 0.85 [CI 0.78 to 0.93], p = 0.001) and high intake of water (100
      ml/day) (1.08 [1.02 to 1.15], p = 0.002), tea (1.05 [1.01 to 1.10], p = 0.019)
      and carbonated beverages (1.07 [1.01 to 1.14], p = 0.023) were associated with
      IBS. A lower intake of dairy products and a higher intake of alcohol and
      carbonated beverages were associated with D-IBS and a higher intake of water and 
      tea was associated with A-IBS. In subjects with IBS the severity of symptoms was 
      associated with a higher intake of vegetables and potatoes in subjects with
      C-IBS, with a higher intake of vegetables in subjects with A-IBS, and with a
      higher intake of fruits and berries, carbonated beverages and alcohol in subjects
      with D-IBS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the diet differed in subjects with and
      without IBS and between IBS subgroups and was associated with the severity of
      symptoms.

TI  - Case-control study of disturbed eating behaviors and related psychographic
      characteristics in young adults with and without diet-related chronic health
      conditions.
PG  - 207-13
LID - 10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.02.003 [doi]
AB  - Young adults with diet-related chronic health conditions (DRCHCs; i.e., type 1
      diabetes, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable
      bowel syndrome) face challenges complying with dietary restrictions required to
      effectively manage their health condition. These restrictions could put them at
      risk for disturbed eating. The purpose of this study was to determine if young
      adults with and without DRCHCs differed with regard to disturbed eating behaviors
      and related psychographics characteristics (i.e., body image attributes, mental
      disorders, intrapersonal characteristics and sociocultural environment [i.e.,
      media and family]). Each DRCHC participant (cases=166) was matched to 4 healthy
      participants (controls=664) based on gender and BMI (+/-0.50 BMI units).
      Conditional logistic regression analyses indicate cases were twice as likely to
      have been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with an eating disorder (p=0.08,
      OR=1.99, CI(90) [1.03-3.83]). Cases were significantly more likely to use
      Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors to manage their weight, i.e., excessive
      exercise (p=0.04, OR=1.41, CI(95) [1.02-1.94]) and misuse medication (p=0.04,
      OR=1.14, CI(95) [1.00-1.29]) than controls. Depression and anxiety were
      significantly higher, and health status was significantly poorer in cases
      compared with controls. DRCHC participants were less likely to report feeling
      body image pressures from the media, placed a greater value on their health, used
      social diversion, and recalled a greater emphasis being placed on their mothers' 
      weights and mealtimes being less structured than control participants. Findings
      indicate that nutrition and other healthcare professionals should incorporate
      screening DRCHC patients for disturbed eating behaviors and eating disorders in
      their standards of care.

      alternative treatments for irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 283-9
LID - 10.1007/s11894-012-0268-2 [doi]
AB  - Complimentary alternative treatment regimens are widely used in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), but the evidence supporting their use varies. For psychological
      treatment options, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness,
      gut-directed hypnotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy, the evidence supporting
      their use in IBS patients is strong, but the availability limits their use in
      clinical practice. Dietary interventions are commonly included in the management 
      of IBS patients, but these are primarily based on studies assessing physiological
      function in relation to dietary components, and to a lesser degree upon research 
      examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of IBS.
      Several probiotic products improve a range of symptoms in IBS patients. Physical 
      activity is of benefit for health in general and recent data implicates its
      usefulness also for IBS patients. Acupuncture does not seem to have an effect
      beyond placebo in IBS. A beneficial effect of some herbal treatments has been
      reported.

PG  - e34938
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific
      gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease
      prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for
      treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with
      differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed.
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included randomized controlled trials in humans
      that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of Pouchitis,
      Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium
      difficile Disease, Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, Traveler's Diarrhea, or
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis. Random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy
      as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic
      species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of
      treatment. Probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight
      gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (CI) 0.51-0.65). Six 
      of the eight diseases: Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, 
      Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, and Antibiotic Associated
      Diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. Traveler's Diarrhea and
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. Of the
      11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except
      for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium
      infantis. Across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects
      of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and 
      treatment lengths. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics are generally beneficial 
      in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Efficacy was not
      observed for Traveler's Diarrhea or Necrotizing Enterocolitis or for the
      probiotic species L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and B. infantis. When choosing to
      use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the
      type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to 
      take into consideration.

LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01242.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional
      gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management
      strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects
      of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based
      guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet 
      and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These
      included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP),
      fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or
      elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant
      studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic
      database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and
      Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and
      research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically 
      appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of
      treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary
      management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy 
      eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP.
      Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP,
      fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical
      diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for
      adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS:
      These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful 
      dietary management of IBS.

      have generated scientific and consumer interest and regulatory debate. The Life
      Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the
      Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess
      the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for
      prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A 
      developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk
      and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory
      bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders,
      including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability 
      and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by
      promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the
      relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of
      human health. New information derived from the characterization of the
      composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions
      among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our
      understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist
      in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.

AB  - This article explores possible relationships between migraine, irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), celiac disease (CD), and gluten sensitivity. These seemingly
      distinct medical entities curiously share many common epidemiological,
      psychosocial, and pathophysiological similarities. Considerable evidence is
      emerging to support a concept that experiencing significant threatening adverse
      events creates a state of hypervigilance in the nervous system, which associates 
      with exaggerated response to future threats and episodic attacks of migraine and 
      IBS. While this sensitizing response is generally considered to reside in the
      central nervous system, it may be possible that the initiation resides in the
      enteric nervous system as well. What appears to link migraine, IBS, and CD is a
      disease model of a genetically sensitive nervous system transformed into one that
      is hypervigilant, and that over time can often develop disabling and pervasive
      disease.

LID - 10.3892/mmr.2012.843 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigated the diet and quality of life of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients in comparison to the background population. Furthermore, 
      it studied the effects of guidance on diet management on changes in food intake, 
      quality of life and symptoms. A total of 35 healthy controls, 36 IBS patients and
      43 IBS patients who had received guidance on diet management 2 years earlier were
      included. The controls and patients were asked to complete an FFQ questionnaire, 
      an SF-NDI questionnaire, an IBS-QoL questionnaire and a Birmingham IBS symptom
      score questionnaire. There were no statistical differences in the intake of
      calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat between the controls and IBS patients, 
      with or without guidance on diet management. IBS patients made a conscious choice
      to avoid certain food items, some of which belong to fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs). They had a
      higher consumption, however, of other food items that are rich in FODMAPs. They
      also avoided other food sources which are crucial for their health. Two years
      after receiving guidance on diet management, IBS patients had a different diet
      profile. They avoided all FODMAPrich food, consumed more food with probiotic
      supplements and did not avoid food sources that were crucial to their health. In 
      addition, they had improved quality of life and reduced symptoms. Although at
      first sight the diet of IBS patients did not differ from that of the background
      population, detailed examination showed avoidance of certain food items. Guidance
      on the management of diet improved their choice of a healthier diet, improved
      quality of life and reduced IBS symptoms.

      antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea.
PG  - 204-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the role of food intolerance in irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (D-IBS). METHODS: Specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      antibodies against 14 common food antigens in the serum were measured in 77
      patients with D-IBS and 26 healthy controls. Food-specific IgG antibodies were
      identified in 39 (50.65%) patients with D-IBS patients compared with four
      (15.38%) controls. For 12 weeks following the serological testing, 35 patients
      with D-IBS and food intolerance consumed diets that excluded the identified food.
      Changes in the main symptoms of D-IBS were evaluated before treatment and
      regularly during treatment in these patients. RESULTS: After 4 weeks' dietary
      therapy, most symptoms of D-IBS had improved. By 12 weeks, all symptom scores had
      decreased significantly compared with the baseline scores. CONCLUSIONS: The
      12-week specific-food exclusion diets resulted in significant improvements in
      abdominal pain (bloating level and frequency), diarrhoea frequency, abdominal
      distension, stool shape, general feelings of distress and total symptom score
      compared with baseline in patients with D-IBS.

PG  - 84-8
AB  - This article reviews the therapeutic role of psychotropic drugs in the treatment 
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders based on the Japanese Diagnostic and
      Therapeutic Guidelines for Psychosomatic Disorders(2006). As an initial step,
      primary care physicians should establish a therapeutic relationship with their
      patients, provide instructions on diet or lifestyle modification, and treat them 
      symptomatically. If these treatments are not satisfactory, as a next step, they
      should evaluate the patient's stressors, coping styles, and comorbid psychiatric 
      disorders, especially anxiety disorders and depression, and prescribe
      psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants and anxiolytics. If these treatments
      are unsatisfactory, as a third step, physicians should refer their patients to
      psychosomatic medicine specialists to inquire about psychotherapy, hypnosis,
      fasting therapy, or relaxation training.

TI  - Functional bowel disorders in adults.
PG  - 83-94
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2012.0083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and stool
      irregularity are common symptoms in primary care and gastroenterology. A routine 
      diagnostic evaluation fails to reveal any underlying somatic condition in about
      half of the affected patients, who are therefore said to have a functional bowel 
      disorder. Physicians are often unsure how extensive the work-up must be to
      exclude a somatic cause. METHODS: This review is based on a selective review of
      the literature, including published guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: 
      Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed on the basis of a typical constellation 
      of symptoms and the absence of pathological findings that would adequately
      explain them (exclusive criteria). The basic diagnostic assessment, consisting of
      a physical examination, basic laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasonography, and
      (in women) a gynecological examination, is supplemented by further testing that
      depends on the patient's symptoms. Colonoscopy is obligatory to rule out
      underlying pathological abnormalities. By communicating the diagnosis of
      irritable bowel syndrome to the patient, the physician shows that the patient's
      symptoms and concerns have been taken seriously. The mainstays of treatment are
      patient education on the benign course of the disease and the encouragement of a 
      salubrious lifestyle. Further treatment options include dietary measures,
      time-limited symptomatic treatment with drugs, and psychotherapy. CONCLUSION: The
      diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder is based on a thorough history (positive
      criteria) and a small battery of diagnostic tests to exclude somatic disease.
      Both the diagnostic assessment and the treatment should be carried out in
      accordance with published guidelines.

      (Review).
PG  - 723-31
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2012.926 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) believe that diet plays a
      significant role in inducing IBS symptoms and desire to know what foods to avoid.
      It has been found that the intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat by
      IBS patients does not differ from that of the background population. IBS patients
      were found to avoid certain food items that are rich in fermentable oligo-, di-
      and monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs), but they did have a high consumption of
      many other FODMAP-rich food items. The diet of IBS patients was found to consist 
      of a low calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin B2 and vitamin A content. There 
      is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy, nor is
      there documented evidence that food intolerance plays a role in IBS symptoms.
      Abnormalities in gut hormones have been reported in IBS patients. As gut hormones
      control and regulate gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this may explain
      the abnormal gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity reported in 
      these patients. Guidance concerning food management which includes individually
      based restrictions of FODMAP-rich food items and individual evaluation of the
      effects of protein-, fat- and carbohydrate-rich/poor diets may reduce IBS
      symptoms.

PG  - 270-5
AB  - In 2011 several articles seemed significant for the practice of general medicine.
      Diagnosis of hypertension needs several measurements and may need 24-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Glycosylated hemoglobin is a reliable tool 
      to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The ABCD2 score with neurological imaging help the
      triage of transient ischemic attacks. Pulmonary embolism can be treated as
      outpatient for low risk patients. Gluten-free diet may be tried in irritable
      bowel syndrome. Nitrofurantoin is a reasonable alternative for simple urinary
      tract infection in women, but antibiotics are not needed after drainage of an
      uncomplicated skin abscess. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor of
      osteoporosis in older men. Sequential use of MMSE and ACE scores is a promising
      approach to assess medical decision-making capacity.

      therapy].
PG  - 116-21
AB  - The study included 132 women (average age 38.5 +/- 1.17 years) with HC observed
      in the CSRIG from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted of 105 women (average 
      age 38.7 +/- 1.6 years) mainly with functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel
      syndrome, functional constipation, functional meteorism, inert colon). Take into 
      account the information relating to obstetric and gynecological history, Physical
      and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS), studies of antibodies to
      alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG), Class A (AHA) and tissue transglutaminase
      (AtTG). Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly
      more frequently than in women with functional bowel disease. One of the causes of
      reproductive disorders in patients with HC might be malabsorption disorders of
      essential nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive
      disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these
      women should be screened for celiac disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Care of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs)
      commonly includes offering guidance on diet, exercise, and other lifestyle
      factors, but there is little information available on the actual lifestyles of
      FGID sufferers. METHODS: An internet questionnaire survey of 15,000 adult members
      of the general public in Japan who were screened for functional dyspepsia (FD)
      and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using the Rome III adult FGID questionnaire
      was conducted. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of FD and IBS was 6.5% and 14.0%,
      respectively, and 3.0% of the subjects met the criteria for both FD and IBS. The 
      prevalence of both FD and IBS was higher in women than in men. The lifestyles of 
      2,547 subjects who met the Rome III criteria for FD, IBS, or both were compared
      with the lifestyles of 1,000 control subjects who did not meet the criteria for
      FD or the criteria for IBS. Compared to the control subjects, a significantly
      lower percentage of subjects with FD, IBS, or both exercised frequently, and a
      significantly higher percentage thought that their sleep was insufficient, ate
      meals irregularly, did not have an appetite, did not like meat, thought that
      their vegetable consumption was insufficient, felt stress in their daily lives,
      and regarded themselves as being highly susceptible to stress. CONCLUSIONS &
      INFERENCES: Persons with FGIDs are affected by impairment of sleep, eating
      habits, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors, and feel excessive stress.
      This suggests that offering lifestyle guidance to FGID patients may be useful.

TI  - Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity: when gluten free is not a 
      fad.
PG  - 68S-75S
LID - 10.1177/0148607111426276 [doi]
AB  - As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health
      practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those
      patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition
      therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in
      symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit
      from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, 
      and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where
      patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of
      symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include
      dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic
      diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients
      and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these
      conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can
      experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the
      development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy 
      and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these
      complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive
      conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality,
      large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in
      this evolving field.

TI  - Diet and its role in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and
      comorbid conditions.
PG  - 1584-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10860.x [doi]
AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Nearly 90% of patients 
      with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to
      a wide variety of dietary comestibles. Current questionnaire-based literature
      suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, 
      tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate
      symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve
      symptoms. At present we recommend employing a controlled method to determine
      dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, in order to identify
      sensitivities while at the same time maintain optimal nutritional intake. We
      review current literature with regard to diet's effect upon IC/BPS and common
      comorbidities (irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, 
      neuropathic pain, vulvodynia, and headache) with a focus upon questionnaire-based
      investigations. We discuss the pathologic mechanisms that may link diet and
      IC/BPS related-pain, concentrating upon specific comestibles such as acidic
      foods, foods high in potassium, caffeine, and alcohol. Up to 90% of patients with
      interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a
      wide variety of comestibles. Pathological mechanisms suggested to be responsible 
      for the relationship between dietary intake and symptom exacerbation include
      peripheral and/or central neural upregulation, bladder epithelial dysfunction,
      and organ 'cross-talk', amongst others. Current questionnaire-based data suggests
      that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea,
      carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, 
      while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms.
      Specific comestible sensitivities varied between patients and may have been
      influenced by comorbid conditions. This suggests that a controlled method to
      determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, may play an
      important role in patient management.

AB  - Again, we present a rich issue with great information to address common clinical 
      questions. A common class of drug (proton pump inhibitors) and insufficiently
      common diet (high fiber content) are related to improved diabetes control. Four
      good health habits make a huge difference, especially for obese patients.
      Meaningful use is just not always that meaningful. Computed tomography scans for 
      common chest complaints probably are overused in emergency rooms. Continuous
      insurance is important to receipt of prevention services, even for those with
      access to care when they do not have insurance. Practice-based research can be
      difficult to accomplish, yet can yield some good results--in this case, improved 
      colon cancer screening rates. Consider hyperaldosteronism in patients with
      resistant hypertension. Reflect on the mistakes other family physicians report;
      we often learn from others' mistakes. Surgical mesh migration can cause many
      things, but would you guess it would cause symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome? 
      A nice primer on what is known about chemoprevention of prostate cancer. And, how
      to influence care outcomes: high-leverage, not just measurable, activities.

TI  - The effect of inactivated Lactobacillus LB fermented culture medium on symptom
      severity: observational investigation in 297 patients with diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 588-91
LID - 10.1159/000332987 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the intensity of symptoms of
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or the consequences of the disease on patients' 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This observational investigation assessed
      the symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, number of stools per day, and stool
      consistency), impact on HRQOL, and consequence on anal continence in 297 patients
      with IBS-D before and after 1 month of probiotic treatment with Lacteol
      (inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium). METHODS: Functional
      assessment using a standardized visual analogue scale in order to quantify
      abdominal pain, bloating, and quality of life before and after 1 month of
      treatment with 2 capsules/day of Lacteol. The number of symptomatic days per
      week, number of stools, consistency of stools, secondary fecal incontinence rate,
      and potential trigger effect of food were quantified. A chi2 test was used to
      compare qualitative data and the variance of quantitative criteria was analyzed. 
      RESULTS: The pain score decreased from 4.46+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 before
      treatment to 2.8+/-0.14 after treatment (p<0.0001). Bloating decreased from
      4.49+/-0.18 to 2.5+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 (p<0.0001). The HRQOL score, which
      is inversely correlated with quality of life, decreased from 5.99+/-0.14 to
      3.92+/-0.16 (p<0.0001). In this cohort study, the fecal incontinence rate
      secondary to diarrhea was clearly higher than that of the general population: 18%
      versus a prevalence of 9-10%, according to different studies. The mean number of 
      stools per week decreased from 17.59 to 12.83 after treatment (p<0.0001). Before 
      treatment, 54% of patients had watery stools and 46% had smooth stools; at the
      end of treatment, only 18.5% of patients still had watery stools, and 34% had
      normal stools. 52% of patients attributed their symptoms to their diet: 34% to
      vegetables, 29% to fruit, 15% to milk, 15% to fat, 6% to peppers and spices, and 
      4% to sugar. CONCLUSION: This observational investigation shed new light on
      patients with IBS-D, the HRQOL of which is altered by a fecal incontinence rate
      twice as high as that of the general population. Correlation with diet is
      confirmed by 1 out of 2 patients reporting poor tolerance of fiber and dairy
      products. Nutritional management should thus be part of these patients'
      treatment. Inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium is a
      probiotic drug that has been used by physicians for a long time to treat patients
      with diarrhea. Strongly concentrated, it has no side effects and seems to help
      these patients. Due to a strong placebo effect in patients with this pathology,
      however, a controlled study is necessary to confirm this result.

AB  - The synbiotic concept was first introduced, along with prebiotics, as "mixtures
      of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the
      survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the
      gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by
      activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting
      bacteria, thus improving host welfare" (Gibson & Roberfroid 1995). Since, there
      have been many in vitro and in vivo studies focusing on the application of
      prebiotics, firstly in health and gradually in disease states. Only recently have
      studies on synbiotics started to emerge with the main focus being on applications
      against disease. Here, we review the current literature, with the main focus on
      in vivo human studies.

TI  - Chronic constipation: current treatment options.
PG  - 22B-28B
AB  - Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects
      patients of all ages. In 2007, a consensus group of 10 Canadian
      gastroenterologists developed a set of recommendations pertaining to the
      management of chronic constipation and constipation dominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. Since then, tegaserod has been withdrawn from the Canadian market. A
      new, highly selective serotonin receptor subtype 4 agonist, prucalopride, has
      been examined in several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials
      demonstrating its efficacy and safety in the management of patients with chronic 
      constipation. Additional studies evaluating the use of stimulant laxatives,
      polyethylene glycol and probiotics in the management of chronic constipation have
      also been published. The present review summarizes the previous recommendations
      and new evidence supporting different treatment modalities - namely, diet and
      lifestyle, bulking agents, stool softeners, osmotic and stimulant laxatives,
      prucalopride and probiotics in the management of chronic constipation. A brief
      summary of lubiprostone and linaclotide is also presented. The quality of
      evidence is presented by adopting the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
      Development and Evaluation system. Finally, a management pyramid for patients
      with chronic constipation is proposed based on the quality of evidence, impact of
      each modality on constipation and on general health, and their availabilities in 
      Canada.

TI  - Distinct microbial populations exist in the mucosa-associated microbiota of
      sub-groups of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 31-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01803.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence to support a role for the
      gastrointestinal microbiota in the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Given the evidence of an inflammatory component to IBS, the mucosa-associated
      microbiota potentially play a key role in its pathogenesis. The objectives were
      to compare the mucosa-associated microbiota between patients with diarrhea
      predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) and controls using 
      fluorescent in situ hybridization and to correlate specific bacteria groups with 
      individual IBS symptoms. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with IBS (27 IBS-D and 20 
      IBS-C) and 26 healthy controls were recruited to the study. Snap-frozen rectal
      biopsies were taken at colonoscopy and bacterial quantification performed by
      hybridizing frozen sections with bacterial-group specific oligonucleotide probes.
      KEY RESULTS: Patients with IBS had significantly greater numbers of total
      mucosa-associated bacteria per mm of rectal epithelium than controls [median 218 
      (IQR - 209) vs 128 (121) P = 0.007], and this was chiefly comprised of
      bacteroides IBS [69 (67) vs 14 (41) P = 0.001] and Eubacterium
      rectale-Clostridium coccoides [52 (58) vs 25 (35) P = 0.03]. Analysis of IBS
      sub-groups demonstrated that bifidobacteria were lower in the IBS-D group than in
      the IBS-C group and controls [24 (32) vs 54 (88) vs 32 (35) P = 0.011]. Finally, 
      amongst patients with IBS, the maximum number of stools per day negatively
      correlated with the number of mucosa-associated bifidobacteria (P < 0.001) and
      lactobacilli (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The mucosa-associated
      microbiota in patients with IBS is significantly different from healthy controls 
      with increases in bacteroides and clostridia and a reduction in bifidobacteria in
      patients with IBS-D.

TI  - Does meal ingestion enhance sensitivity of visceroperception assessment in
      irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 47-53, e3
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01802.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visceral hypersensitivity is frequently observed in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Previous studies have shown that administration of a meal can
      aggravate symptoms or increase visceroperception in IBS patients. We investigated
      whether meal ingestion could increase the sensitivity of the barostat procedure
      for the detection of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients. METHODS:
      Seventy-one IBS patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study.
      All subjects underwent a barostat procedure under fasted and postprandial
      conditions to measure visceroperception. Urge, discomfort, and pain were scored
      on a visual analog scale. Furthermore, percentages of hypersensitive IBS patients
      and HC were calculated and dynamic rectal compliance was assessed. KEY RESULTS:
      In IBS patients, urge, discomfort, and pain scores were significantly increased
      postprandially vs the fasted state. The HC showed increased scores for urge and
      pain only. Rectal dynamic compliance remained unaltered in both groups.
      Postprandial hypersensitivity percentages did not significantly differ vs the
      fasted state in IBS patients, nor in HC. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Postprandial
      barostat measurement enhances visceroperception in IBS but has no added value to 
      detect visceral hypersensitivity in individual IBS patients.

TI  - The shifting interface between IBS and IBD.
PG  - 586-92
LID - 10.1016/j.coph.2011.09.009 [doi]
AB  - Recent data developing from the study of postinfectious IBS has challenged the
      belief that IBS is a purely psychological disorder. Distinct abnormalities of the
      gut mucosa have been reported including immune activation and increased release
      of inflammatory mediators with some overlap with IBD. New studies show that
      genetic factors which predispose to IBD are also associated with IBS. A common
      feature is impaired gut barrier function which appears to precede the development
      of IBD while in IBS it may be the result of either a preceding infection or
      psychosocial stress. Stress can activate mast cells which are a feature in most
      but not all IBS series. Anti-inflammatory treatments targeting activated mast
      cells may benefit IBS patients but currently the evidence is weak and larger
      trials are needed. Changes in the commensal microbiota have been recently
      described with a "dysbiosis" in CD characterised by reduced diversity.
      Inconsistent changes have also been described in IBS but studies controlling for 
      antibiotic use and differences in diet and bowel habit are needed before
      definitive conclusions can be made.

AB  - Thanks to rapid progress in the development and application of molecular
      techniques to the assessment of the human gut microbiome, the true nature,
      diversity and metabolic potential of this 'hidden organ' are being revealed.
      Simultaneously, the complex physiological, immunological and metabolic
      interactions between host and microbiome are being untangled. By contrast, the
      probiotic concept has been with us for decades and, while supported more by fad
      and folklore in the past, is now gaining support, not only from experimental work
      in animal models, but also by well-designed studies in human diseases, most
      notably infectious diarrheas, inflammatory bowel disease and the irritable bowel 
      syndrome.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health issue that is characterized by 
      abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, and altered visceral perception. The
      complexity and variability in symptoms pose serious challenges in treating IBS.
      Current therapy for IBS is primarily focused on reducing the abdominal pain,
      thereby improving the quality of life to a significant extent. Although the use
      of fiber rich diet is widely recommended in treating IBS, some studies have
      questioned its use. Intra-colonic butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is
      primarily produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. In the
      existing literature there are conflicting reports about the function of butyrate.
      In rats it is known to induce visceral hypersensitivity without altered
      pathology, whereas in humans it has been reported to reduce visceral pain.
      Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for this contrasting effect of
      butyrate is important before recommending fiber rich diet to IBS patients.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption in children with recurrent abdominal pain: positive
      effects of dietary treatment.
PG  - 17-21
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1279747 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of a
      fructose-restricted diet in otherwise healthy children with abdominal pain and
      pathologic fructose hydrogen breath test. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 75 children
      (aging 3-14 years) with recurrent abdominal pain without gastrointestinal disease
      and fructose malabsorption followed a fructose restricted diet for 4 weeks.
      RESULTS: A median decline of weekly pain frequency from 4 (mean 3.64+1.6) before 
      diet to 1 (mean 1.46+1.4; p<0.001) under fructose restriction was documented. The
      intensity of pain decreased from median 6 (mean 5.83+2.0) before intervention to 
      median 3 (mean 3.4+2.5; p<0.001) with diet. Several additional life
      quality-influencing parameters such as daily stool frequency, nausea, problems to
      fall asleep, missed school days also improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study provides evidence that dietary fructose restriction represents a useful
      approach to address recurrent abdominal symptoms in children with fructose
      malabsorption.

TI  - Diagnostic approach to chronic constipation in adults.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - Constipation is traditionally defined as three or fewer bowel movements per week.
      Risk factors for constipation include female sex, older age, inactivity, low
      caloric intake, low-fiber diet, low income, low educational level, and taking a
      large number of medications. Chronic constipation is classified as functional
      (primary) or secondary. Functional constipation can be divided into normal
      transit, slow transit, or outlet constipation. Possible causes of secondary
      chronic constipation include medication use, as well as medical conditions, such 
      as hypothyroidism or irritable bowel syndrome. Frail older patients may present
      with nonspecific symptoms of constipation, such as delirium, anorexia, and
      functional decline. The evaluation of constipation includes a history and
      physical examination to rule out alarm signs and symptoms. These include evidence
      of bleeding, unintended weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, acute onset
      constipation in older patients, and rectal prolapse. Patients with one or more
      alarm signs or symptoms require prompt evaluation. Referral to a subspecialist
      for additional evaluation and diagnostic testing may be warranted.

TI  - Fecal assays detect hypersensitivity to cow's milk protein and gluten in adults
      with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 965-971.e3
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2011.07.030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      symptoms suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH); their symptoms improve when they
      are placed on elimination diets. No assays identify patients with FH with
      satisfactory levels of sensitivity. We determined the frequency of FH among
      patients with symptoms of IBS and the ability of fecal assays for tryptase,
      eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), or calprotectin to diagnose FH. METHODS: The
      study included 160 patients with IBS, 40 patients with other gastrointestinal
      diseases, and 50 healthy individuals (controls). At the start of the study,
      patients completed a symptom severity questionnaire, fecal samples were assayed, 
      and levels of specific immunoglobulin E were measured. Patients were observed for
      4 weeks, placed on an elimination diet (without cow's milk and derivatives,
      wheat, egg, tomato, and chocolate) for 4 weeks, and kept a diet diary. Those who 
      reported improvements after the elimination diet period were then diagnosed with 
      FH, based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food
      challenge (with cow's milk proteins and then with wheat proteins). RESULTS: Forty
      of the patients with IBS (25%) were found to have FH. Levels of fecal ECP and
      tryptase were significantly higher among patients with IBS and FH than those
      without FH. The ECP assay was the most accurate assay for diagnosis of FH,
      showing 65% sensitivity and 91% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of 
      patients with IBS have FH. These patients had increased levels of fecal ECP and
      tryptase, indicating that they might cause inflammation in patients with IBS.
      Fecal assays for ECP could be used to identify FH in patients with IBS.

PG  - 491-6
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328349eb4d [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the importance of nutrition in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to improve. With increasing evidence
      or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of
      nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment 
      of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel
      syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized
      in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because
      of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against
      new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now
      beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin
      D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory
      effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a
      randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and
      micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of
      all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding
      of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more
      effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like
      immune-suppressants should be explored.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic trial of a cannabinoid agonist shows reduced fasting colonic
      motility in patients with nonconstipated irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1638-47.e1-7
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.07.036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cannabinoid receptors are located on cholinergic neurons.
      Genetic variants that affect endocannabinoid metabolism are associated with
      colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea. We
      compared the effects of dronabinol, a nonselective agonist of the cannabinoid
      receptor, with those of placebo on colonic motility and sensation in patients
      with IBS, and examined the effects of IBS subtype and specific genetic variants
      in cannabinoid mechanisms. METHODS: Seventy-five individuals with IBS (35 with
      IBS with constipation, 35 with IBS with diarrhea, and with 5 IBS alternating)
      were randomly assigned to groups that were given 1 dose of placebo or 2.5 mg or
      5.0 mg dronabinol. We assessed left colonic compliance, motility index (MI),
      tone, and sensation during fasting and after a meal. We analyzed the single
      nucleotide polymorphisms CNR1 rs806378, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
      rs324420, and MGLL rs4881. RESULTS: In all patients, dronabinol decreased fasting
      proximal left colonic MI compared with placebo (overall P = .05; for 5 mg
      dronabinol, P = .046), decreased fasting distal left colonic MI (overall P = .08;
      for 5 mg, P = .13), and increased colonic compliance (P = .058). The effects of
      dronabinol were greatest in patients with IBS with diarrhea or IBS alternating
      (proximal colonic MI, overall P = .022; compliance, overall P = .03). Dronabinol 
      did not alter sensation or tone. CNR1 rs806378 (CC vs CT/TT) appeared to affect
      fasting proximal MI in all patients with IBS (P = .075). Dronabinol affected
      fasting distal MI in patients, regardless of FAAH rs324420 variant (CA/AA vs CC) 
      (P = .046); the greatest effects were observed among IBS with constipation
      patients with the FAAH CC variant (P = .045). Dronabinol affected fasting
      proximal MI in patients with IBS with diarrhea or alternating with the variant
      FAAH CA/AA (P = .013). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS with diarrhea or
      alternating, dronabinol reduces fasting colonic motility; FAAH and CNR1 variants 
      could influence the effects of this drug on colonic motility.

TI  - Epidemiology and symptom profile of gastroesophageal reflux in the Indian
      population: report of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology Task Force.
PG  - 118-27
LID - 10.1007/s12664-011-0112-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications are
      thought to be infrequent in India; there are no data from India on the prevalence
      of and risk factors for GERD. The Indian Society of Gastroenterology formed a
      task force aiming to study: (a) the frequency and profile of GERD in India, (b)
      factors including diet associated with GERD. METHODS: In this prospective,
      multi-center (12 centers) study, data were obtained using a questionnaire from
      3224 subjects regarding the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn,
      regurgitation and other symptoms of GERD. Data were also obtained regarding their
      dietary habits, addictions, and lifestyle, and whether any of these were related 
      or had been altered because of symptoms. Data were analyzed using univariate and 
      multivariate methods. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-five (7.6%) of 3224 subjects
      had heartburn and/or regurgitation at least once a week. On univariate analysis, 
      older age (OR 1.012; 95% CI 1.003-1.021), consumption of non-vegetarian and fried
      foods, aerated drinks, tea/coffee were associated with GERD. Frequency of smoking
      was similar among subjects with or without GERD. Body mass index (BMI) was
      similar in subjects with and without GERD. On multivariate analysis, consumption 
      of non-vegetarian food was independently associated with GERD symptoms. Overlap
      with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was not uncommon; 21% reported
      difficulty in passage of stool and 9% had mucus in stools. About 25% of patients 
      had consulted a doctor previously for their gastrointestinal symptoms.
      CONCLUSION: 7.6% of Indian subjects have significant GERD symptoms. Consumption
      of non-vegetarian foods was an independent predictor of GERD. BMI was comparable 
      among subjects with or without GERD.

AB  - There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment 
      we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive
      tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol,
      microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including
      obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases 
      of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the
      microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this
      is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The
      luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external
      factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's
      esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and
      colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel 
      diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel
      syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of
      particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are
      immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind
      disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic
      esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition
      mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined,
      providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free
      diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that 
      environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for
      its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in
      all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by
      modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to
      gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading
      ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or
      modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other
      novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that 
      lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the
      immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting 
      tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell
      responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease
      reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune
      response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and
      small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as
      ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much 
      more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and
      their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment
      strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.

      therapy].
PG  - 12-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Violation of reproductive function in patients with celiac disease
      can manifest as delayed puberty, infertility, amenorrhea, premature menopause,
      spontaneous abortion, low birth weight. The aim of the study was to establish the
      frequency and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in
      the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women
      (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17 years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from
      2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6
      years) with predominantly functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome,
      functional constipation, functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into
      account information regarding obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of
      malabsorption syndrome (MS) study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin
      (IG) A class (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age
      of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the control group - 13,0 +/-
      1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%) had menstruation begun at
      age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged 17 and older. In the
      comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only at 13.3% of women. In
      61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle while in the comparison
      group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001). Prolonged periods of
      amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3 times more likely than 
      the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p < 0.01). They also had
      nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3%
      respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead children birth was about the same:
      2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The frequency of reproductive disorders
      increased with the growth of the severity of MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months
      of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and
      there were regular menses. Three women of childbearing age, strictly abided the
      GFD and had a history of repeated spontaneous abortion during the year managed to
      get pregnant and give birth to healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive 
      disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more likely than at
      women with functional bowel disease. One of the reasons of reproductive disorders
      in patients with CD can be malabsorption of necessary nutrients in the small
      intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk 
      factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.

      in the United States.
PG  - 199-203
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there might be an increased prevalence of
      undiagnosed celiac disease among a population of infertile women using serologic 
      screening. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed at an academic 
      infertility clinic in the United States. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of
      celiac disease in this population was 2.1% (4/188). There was a significantly
      increased prevalence (5.9%) of undiagnosed celiac disease among women presenting 
      with unexplained infertility (n = 51). CONCLUSION: Women with unexplained
      infertility are at increased risk for having undiagnosed celiac disease, which
      may be a potentially modifiable (and treatable) risk factor.

TI  - Management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults: conventional and
      complementary/alternative approaches.
PG  - 134-51
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with a
      range of symptoms that significantly affect quality of life for patients. The
      difficulty of differential diagnosis and its treatment may significantly delay
      initiation of optimal therapy. Hence, persons with IBS often self-treat symptoms 
      with non-prescribed pharmacological regimens and/or complementary and alternative
      medicines (CAM) and by modifying diet and daily activities. In addition, most
      common pharmacological approaches target IBS symptom management rather than
      treatment, and prescribed medications often result in significant side effects.
      The purposes of this review article are to: (1) address current issues related to
      IBS, including symptom presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment options;
      (2) summarize benefits and side effects of currently available pharmacological
      regimens and other symptom management strategies, with an emphasis on commonly
      used CAM therapies and diet modification; and (3) outline recommendations and
      future directions of IBS management based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses,
      and research findings.

AB  - Most subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience an association
      between symptoms and food consumption. Although dietary intake has been the focus
      of previous research, attention to specific nutrients has been rare. We
      hypothesized that there is an association between the severity of IBS symptoms
      and the intake of specific food groups and specific nutrients. In this
      cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the
      Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every
      evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of 
      food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period.
      Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily
      IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B(6) was the only
      component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score.
      The median daily intake of vitamin B(6) was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the
      recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day
      or more, respectively. A high symptom score was associated with low vitamin B(6) 
      intake (adjusted R(2) = 0.583; beta = -4.431; 95% confidence interval, -6.386 to 
      -2.476; P = 0.0002). A significant inverse association between intake of vitamin 
      B(6) and severity of IBS symptoms might have clinical implications.

TI  - Comparison of symptom response following advice for a diet low in fermentable
      carbohydrates (FODMAPs) versus standard dietary advice in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 487-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2011.01162.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that the consumption of fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may result
      in symptoms in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The present
      study aimed to determine whether a low FODMAP diet is effective for symptom
      control in patients with IBS and to compare its effects with those of standard
      dietary advice based on the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical
      Excellence (NICE) guidelines. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBS who attended
      a follow-up dietetic outpatient visit for dietary management of their symptoms
      were included. Questionnaires were completed for patients who received standard
      (n = 39) or low FODMAP dietary advice (n = 43). Data were recorded on symptom
      change and comparisons were made between groups. RESULTS: In total, more patients
      in the low FODMAP group reported satisfaction with their symptom response (76%)
      compared to the standard group (54%, P = 0.038). Composite symptom score data
      showed better overall symptom response in the low FODMAP group (86%) compared to 
      the standard group (49%, P < 0.001). Significantly more patients in the low
      FODMAP group compared to the standard group reported improvements in bloating
      (low FODMAP 82% versus standard 49%, P = 0.002), abdominal pain (low FODMAP 85%
      versus standard 61%, P = 0.023) and flatulence (low FODMAP 87% versus standard
      50%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet appears to be more effective than
      standard dietary advice for symptom control in IBS.

PG  - 291-307, vii
LID - 10.1016/j.gtc.2011.03.011 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by
      nonspecific symptoms that can mimic other common medical conditions. A careful
      history and physical examination may reveal clues that suggest a coexisting or
      alternative diagnosis, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or celiac
      disease (CD). Testing for bacterial overgrowth has limitations, but emerging data
      suggest that antibiotics may be of some benefit in patients with IBS with
      diarrhea and bloating. CD seems to have a higher prevalence in patients with IBS.
      Some patients with IBS may have symptomatic improvement on gluten-restricted
      diets, without histologic or serologic evidence of CD.

TI  - Gluten-free diet in nonceliac disease.
PG  - 294-9
LID - 10.1177/0884533611405538 [doi]
AB  - A gluten-free diet (GFD) is commonly recognized as the treatment for celiac
      disease. It also has been investigated as a treatment option for other medical
      conditions, including dermatitis herpetiformis, irritable bowel syndrome,
      neurologic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and HIV-associated
      enteropathy. The strength of the evidence for the use of a GFD in these nonceliac
      diseases varies, and future research may better define the benefits of a GFD for 
      those conditions with weak existing evidence.

TI  - Testing for gluten-related disorders in clinical practice: the role of serology
      in managing the spectrum of gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single most efficient serological
      test for the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is well known that immunoglobulin A 
      tissue transglutaminase levels correlate with the degree of intestinal damage,
      and that values can fluctuate in patients over time. Serological testing can be
      used to identify symptomatic individuals that need a confirmatory biopsy, to
      screen at-risk populations or to monitor diet compliance in patients previously
      diagnosed with celiac disease. Thus, interpretation of serological testing
      requires consideration of the full clinical scenario. Antigliadin tests are no
      longer recommended for the diagnosis of classical celiac disease. However, our
      understanding of the pathogenesis and spectrum of gluten sensitivity has
      improved, and gluten-sensitive irritable bowel syndrome patients are increasingly
      being recognized. Studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of
      antigliadin serology in the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A lack of reliable treatments for abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders prompts interest in new therapies. AIM: To evaluate
      systematically the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children.
      METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, trial registries and
      proceedings of major meetings were searched for randomised controlled trials
      (RCTs) evaluating LGG supplementation in children with abdominal pain-related
      functional gastrointestinal disorders based on the Rome II or Rome III criteria. 
      Risk of bias was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation
      concealment, blinding and follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, LGG
      supplementation was associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment
      responders (defined as no pain or a decrease in pain intensity) in the overall
      population with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (three RCTs, n = 290; risk ratio, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59, number needed to
      treat, NNT 7, 95% CI 4-22) and in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subgroup
      (three RCTs, n = 167; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.27, NNT 4, 95% CI 3-8). However, no 
      difference was found in the rate of treatment responders between children with
      functional abdominal pain or functional dyspepsia who received placebo or LGG.
      The intensity of pain was significantly reduced in the overall study population
      and in the IBS subgroup. The frequency of pain was significantly reduced in the
      IBS subgroup only. CONCLUSION: The use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG moderately
      increases treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, particularly among children with IBS.

TI  - Does a self-management program change dietary intake in adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome?
PG  - 108-16
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e31821092e8 [doi]
AB  - Making dietary changes such as increasing fiber intake is recommended for the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Few studies have explored the
      efficacy of education on compliance with recommendations such as increasing
      fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome. This 
      study examined the effect of a multicomponent self-management intervention that
      included strategies to enhance fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake. Participants
      with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were randomized to usual care
      or individualized comprehensive self-management, delivered either in-person or by
      telephone. Since previously published analyses show the two delivery modes to be 
      equally effective, the two intervention groups were combined. Of the 188
      individuals randomized, 173 participants (113 in the self-management group and 60
      in the usual care group; 23 men, 150 women) provided data on at least one of the 
      three follow-up occasions (3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization). Fiber,
      vegetable, and fruit intakes were measured using the Food Frequency
      Questionnaire. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated increases (p <
      .05) in fiber and fruit intake and a trend in vegetable intake at 6 and 12 months
      postintervention. Improvement in dietary fiber intake following a self-management
      intervention for IBS continues to 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Food-related symptoms are commonly described by patients with
      functional bowel disorders, but dietary change as an evidence-based therapy has
      not been part of routine management strategies. This reviews aims to discuss
      strategies commonly applied. METHOD: Published literature was reviewed. RESULTS: 
      Traditional approaches involve elimination diets followed by placebo-controlled
      reintroduction of specific foods, which is tedious at best and not applied in
      routine practice. Pathogenically-based approaches include determining what food
      components are inducing food hypersensitivity responses using specific
      biomarkers, but this is probably applicable to a small proportion of patients
      only and has met with only limited success. Food bioactive chemicals, such as
      salicylates, have been targeted, but there is a paucity of quality evidence for
      or against this approach. In contrast, targeting poorly absorbed dietary
      components that might induce luminal distension via osmotic effects and rapid
      fermentation (FODMAPs) has been successful and the efficacy of the
      dietitian-delivered low FODMAP diet is now supported by high quality evidence.
      Improvement of all symptoms of FBD in three out of four patients has been
      achieved. The diet may potentially improve stool frequency in patients with an
      ileal pouch or a high output ileostomy, or functional symptoms in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. FODMAPs in enteral formulas may also be responsible
      for diarrhoea induced by enteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction of
      FODMAPs is an effective therapy in the majority of patients with functional bowel
      symptoms and, provided dietitians are trained in the technique, should be first
      line therapy.

AB  - Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a disorder in which upper abdominal symptoms occur
      in the absence of organic disease that explains them. Many pathogenic factors
      have been proposed for FD, including motility abnormalities, visceral
      hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, excessive gastric acid secretion,
      Helicobacter pylori, genetics, environment, diet, lifestyle, and post-infectious 
      FD. Many of those pathogenic factors are also common to irritable bowel syndrome 
      and other functional gastrointestinal disorders, so understanding FD offers a
      glimpse into the nature of functional gastrointestinal disorders in general.
      Motility abnormalities and visceral hypersensitivity are thought to be important 
      in the manifestation of FD symptoms, but the other factors are also thought to
      contribute by interacting and modifying motility and visceral hypersensitivity.

TI  - Effects of probiotic fermented milk on symptoms and intestinal flora in patients 
      with irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 663-72
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2011.565066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms has been mixed, but remains
      an intriguing treatment option with appeal to the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized double-blind to a daily 
      intake of 500 ml of fermented milk containing at least 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml of
      Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and
      Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or an equal volume of acidified milk for 8 weeks.
      Symptoms were assessed at baseline and weekly using a disease-specific validated 
      symptom rating scale (IBS-SSI). The predefined primary outcome measure was
      patient reported adequate symptom relief. Adherence to study protocol were
      assessed by performing stool samples at the of the treatment period. RESULTS:
      Eight-one patients were screened. Sixty-four patients were randomized; 18
      patients did not complete the study due to protocol violations or withdrew due to
      lack of effect. Fifty-two patients (13 males) completed the study as per
      protocol; mean age was 51.3 years (range 29-67). The proportion of patients
      reporting adequate symptom relief increased in both patient groups, but there was
      not any statistical difference between the groups. IBS-SSI scores did not differ 
      statistically between the groups at the end of the treatment period, but improved
      during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: During this 8-week trial
      gastrointestinal symptoms improved. However, there was no difference between
      treatment with fermented milk containing probiotics or acidified milk. The effect
      of probiotics on IBS symptoms remains uncertain and further studies are
      warranted.

AB  - To determine the growth pattern and in vitro susceptibility of Blastocystis
      hominis to metronidazole (MTZ), garlic, ginger, white cumin, and black pepper.
      Stool specimens were collected from 16 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 10
      controls between July-November 2010. Stool microscopy and culture for B. hominis 
      was performed. Drug susceptibility assays was done using 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml of
      MTZ, garlic, ginger, white cumin, and black pepper. Effect was assessed on B.
      hominis culture after 48 h. Stool DNA was extracted using stool DNA extraction
      kit (Qiagen) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done using subtype-specific
      sequence-tagged-site primers. B. hominis genotype 3 and coinfection of 1 and 3
      tended to grow well in culture compared to isolated type 1 infection. Exposed to 
      MTZ at a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml, 38% (6/16) B. hominis from IBS did not grow
      in culture compared to 100% (10/10) of B. hominis from control (p = 0.001). When 
      they were exposed to MTZ at 0.1 mg/ml, 56% (9/16) B. hominis from IBS did not
      grow in cultures compared to 100% (10/10) from control (p = 0.01). Forty-four
      percent (7/16) B. hominis from IBS did not grow in culture compared to 100%
      (10/10) B. hominis from control when exposed to garlic at a concentration of 0.01
      mg/ml (p = 0.003) and following exposure to garlic at 0.1 mg/ml, 38% (6/16) B.
      hominis from IBS did not grow in cultures compared to 100% (10/10) from control
      (p = 0.001). B. hominis isolates from IBS had a cell count of 6,625 at a MTZ
      concentration of 0.01 mg/ml that reduced to 1,250 as MTZ concentration was
      increased to 0.1 mg/ml (p = 0.08). B. hominis from IBS with a mean cell count of 
      3 x 10(5) at baseline decreased to 1 x 10(4) when exposed to garlic at 0.01 mg/ml
      (p < 0.001) and to 1 x 10(3) (p < 0.001) when garlic was 0.1 mg/ml. B. hominis
      from IBS cell count decreased to 1 x 10(5) when exposed to white cumin at 0.01
      mg/ml (p = 0.01) and to 1 x 10(5) (p < 0.001) when white cumin was 0.1 mg/ml.
      Exposed to black pepper at 0.1 mg/ml, cell count of B. hominis from IBS decreased
      to 1 x 10(5) (p = 0.01). B. hominis from IBS decreased to 1.3 x 10(5) exposed to 
      ginger at 0.01 mg/ml (p = 0.001). B. hominis isolates were mostly genotypes 3,
      type 1 and 3 coinfection, and non-typeable B. hominis isolates. B. hominis
      isolates from IBS mostly genotype 1 demonstrated an increased sensitivity to
      garlic at 0.01 mg/ml with a B. hominis cell count of 3,714 compared to 6,142 when
      exposed to 0.01 mg/ml of MTZ. However, this sensitivity did not increase as
      garlic concentration was increased to 0.1 mg/ml, for B. hominis cell count was
      6,000 compared to 1,428 as MTZ was increased to 0.1 mg/ml.

TI  - The role of psyllium fibre supplementation in treating irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - e107-14
AB  - North American family physicians and dietitians commonly recommend psyllium fibre
      supplementation for treating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this 
      review, evidence on the effectiveness of psyllium supplementation for diagnosed
      IBS symptoms was evaluated and summarized. A systematic search of MEDLINE,
      CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Included were full-length,
      peer-reviewed, English-language articles in which psyllium ingestion was tested
      for its effect on IBS symptoms. Quality of these articles also was assessed.
      Twelve met the criteria for complete data abstraction. Seventy-five percent of
      the studies examined were of weak quality. Study designs and methods were
      heterogeneous. Patient-perceived global symptoms improved significantly in six of
      the nine studies measuring a global symptom outcome. In one study, significant
      improvements occurred in reported abdominal pain; in three, improvement did not
      occur. Quality of life and flatulence did not improve significantly in any
      studies in which these outcomes were examined. The results of this systematic
      review indicate limited and conflicting evidence to support the recommendation of
      psyllium supplementation for symptomatic IBS treatment.

TI  - Editorial: Can gluten contribute to irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 516-8
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.490 [doi]
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders are the most common gastroenterological
      problem in our society. Changes in gut function, including pain perception,
      motility, and intestinal permeability, and low-grade inflammation have been
      described in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The triggering factors
      for the described immunity and gut functional changes in patients with IBS are
      not completely understood. Similarly to post-infective IBS, some patients with
      IBS symptoms exhibit immunological evidence of gluten sensitivity but have no
      overt intestinal mucosal injury. They have symptoms that meet the diagnostic
      criteria for IBS and respond symptomatically to exclusion of gluten from the
      diet. Thus, gluten sensitivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup 
      of IBS patients. Unfortunately, there remain many unanswered questions regarding 
      the mechanistic link between gluten sensitivity and functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms.

AB  - Gut-acting therapies are common therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Most of these peripheral acting agents are primarily targeted at individual
      symptoms. The evidence supporting the use of these agents in IBS is largely
      anecdotal. Serotonergic agents and the chloride channel activator lubiprostone
      have shown efficacy in treating symptoms of IBS. The clinical evidence supporting
      the use of these agents is based on data from high-quality clinical trials. The
      use of serotonergic agents for IBS in the United States is limited to the
      5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonist alosetron in the treatment of women with severe 
      IBS with diarrhea refractory to traditional therapy.

AB  - After years of inattention, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that
      dietary constituents at least exacerbate symptoms and perhaps contribute to the
      pathogenesis of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although patients with IBS
      self-report food allergies more often than the general population, the evidence
      suggests that true food allergies are relatively uncommon. Less clearly defined
      food intolerances may be an important contributor to symptoms in IBS patients.
      This article reviews the literature supporting a causal link between food and the
      symptoms of IBS as well as the evidence supporting dietary interventions as a
      means of managing IBS symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterised by episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits.
      Many IBS sufferers believe that diet may play a role in triggering these episodes
      and may avoid certain foods. However relatively few studies have undertaken a
      dietary assessment in IBS sufferers to examine the wider impact of the condition 
      upon diet. METHODS: 104 individuals with IBS were recruited and asked to complete
      a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The data were analysed against
      Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom and
      observed intakes for the general population and for differences between IBS
      subtypes and the UK population. RESULTS: The data show that the dietary intakes
      of this population of IBS sufferers met the UK Dietary Reference Values. The
      average energy intake of the population exceeded the Estimated Average
      Requirements of the UK population and the balance of macronutrients was
      favourable. Intakes of selected micronutrients significantly exceeded the
      reference nutrient intakes. There were no differences between IBS subtypes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The IBS subpopulation appear to have an adequate and balanced
      macronutrient intake with no evidence of inadequate micronutrient intake.

AB  - Acute abdominal pain caused by perforation, intestinal lymphoma or
      intussusception is an uncommon manifestation in adult celiac disease. We report a
      49 year-old female with history of irritable bowel syndrome and osteoporosis
      consulting for acute abdominal pain and severe abdominal distention. Abdominal CT
      scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a jejunal intussusception and other
      radiological alterations that suggested the possibility of celiac disease.
      Serological antibodies (endomysial and transglutaminase antibodies), endoscopy
      and the pathological study of duodenal biopsies confirmed the diagnosis. With a
      gluten free diet, the patient remains asymptomatic.

TI  - Health benefits of probiotics: are mixtures more effective than single strains?
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s00394-010-0166-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes
      incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of
      probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures 
      are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more
      or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: 
      Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including
      irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune
      function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation,
      inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
      However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its
      component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more
      effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide
      range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain
      probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains
      that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to
      synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic
      dose used in some studies is at present unclear.

TI  - Gluten causes gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects without celiac disease: a
      double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 508-14; quiz 515
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.487 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for
      gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is
      minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study
      were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac
      individuals and to examine the mechanism. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically
      controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo 
      in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet
      for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and
      markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored.
      RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as 
      per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. 
      Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the
      gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared
      with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a
      visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week 
      for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction 
      with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin
      antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal
      lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or
      intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in
      individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: "Non-celiac gluten intolerance"
      may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated.

PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1007/s10067-010-1625-x [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate, firstly, the relationship between
      diet and disease activity and, secondly, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and their relationship to diet among patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) using a cross-sectional design. One hundred sixty-five
      individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal
      questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal 
      symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., 
      the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation
      between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients
      reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain
      foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal
      pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status
      according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively).
      Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher
      consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured
      milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In
      multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were
      independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To
      conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and
      disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between
      diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be
      prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption: true condition or a variance from normality.
PG  - 16-21

AB  - Fructose exists in food naturally or as a sweetening additive. It has been
      thought that fructose malabsorption may cause the gastrointestinal symptoms seen 
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, fructose malabsorption is
      still poorly understood, and clinicians are still uncertain of its role. This
      review attempts to clarify the relation between fructose malabsorption and
      symptoms in normal individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The
      main problem lies in the diagnosis. First, there is no definite cut off value for
      the breath tests. Second, we are unsure of the normal absorptive capacity of
      fructose in normal individuals. Normal individuals will have a degree of fructose
      malabsorption with or without symptoms depending on the dose of fructose used.
      From earlier studies, 25 g of fructose seems to be the cut-off dose to
      investigate fructose malabsorption, with a positive breath test at this dose
      suggesting abnormally low capacity to absorb fructose. This low level may be
      difficult to exclude from the daily diet, resulting in symptoms of fructose
      malabsorption.
