AB  - An evaluation of the effect of 1 year of a gluten-free diet was performed in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome displaying
      lymphocytic enteritis. Gluten withdrawal produced a slight but significant
      improvement of the functional symptoms, suggesting that gluten might be partly
      responsible for this clinical picture. This hypothesis should be confirmed by a
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial since it cannot be ruled out that the
      studied patients displayed a subjective sensation of improvement due to the
      placebo effect of gluten withdrawal. Further investigations are needed before
      recommending gluten withdrawal in patients with fibromyalgia and lymphocytic
      enteritis.

AB  - New strategies for the care of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are developing and 
      several novel treatments have been globally produced. New methods of care should 
      be customized geographically because each country has a specific medical system, 
      life style, eating habit, gut microbiota, genes and so on. Several clinical
      guidelines for IBS have been proposed and the Japanese Society of
      Gastroenterology (JSGE) subsequently developed evidence-based clinical practice
      guidelines for IBS. Sixty-two clinical questions (CQs) comprising 1 definition, 6
      epidemiology, 6 pathophysiology, 10 diagnosis, 30 treatment, 4 prognosis, and 5
      complications were proposed and statements were made to answer to CQs. A
      diagnosis algorithm and a three-step treatment was provided for patients with
      chronic abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort and/or abnormal bowel movement. If
      more than one alarm symptom/sign, risk factor and/or routine examination is
      positive, colonoscopy is indicated. If all of them, or the subsequent
      colonoscopy, are/is negative, Rome III or compatible criteria is applied. After
      IBS diagnosis, step 1 therapy consisting of diet therapy, behavioral modification
      and gut-targeted pharmacotherapy is indicated for four weeks. Non-responders to
      step 1 therapy proceed to the second step that includes psychopharmacological
      agents and simple psychotherapy for four weeks. In the third step, for patients
      non-responsive to step 2 therapy, a combination of gut-targeted pharmacotherapy, 
      psychopharmacological treatments and/or specific psychotherapy is/are indicated. 
      Clinical guidelines and consensus for IBS treatment in Japan are well suited for 
      Japanese IBS patients; as such, they may provide useful insight for IBS treatment
      in other countries around the world.

TI  - Ehealth: low FODMAP diet vs Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 16215-26
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i43.16215 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of a low fermentable, oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) and the probiotic
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      Randomised, unblinded controlled trial on the effect of 6-wk treatment with LFD, 
      LGG or a normal Danish/Western diet (ND) in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome III
      diagnostic criteria, recruited between November 2009 and April 2013. Patients
      were required to complete on a weekly basis the IBS severity score system
      (IBS-SSS) and IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) questionnaires in a specially
      developed IBS web self-monitoring application. We investigated whether LFD or LGG
      could reduce IBS-SSS and improve QOL in IBS patients. RESULTS: One hundred
      twenty-three patients (median age 37 years, range: 18-74 years), 90 (73%) females
      were randomised: 42 to LFD, 41 to LGG and 40 to ND. A significant reduction in
      mean +/- SD of IBS-SSS from baseline to week 6 between LFD vs LGG vs ND was
      revealed: 133 +/- 122 vs 68 +/- 107, 133 +/- 122 vs 34 +/- 95, P < 0.01. Adjusted
      changes of IBS-SSS for baseline covariates showed statistically significant
      reduction of IBS-SSS in LFD group compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 75; 95%CI:
      24-126, P < 0.01), but not in LGG compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 32; 95%CI: 18-80,
      P = 0.20). IBS-QOL was not altered significantly in any of the three groups: mean
      +/- SD in LFD 8 +/- 18 vs LGG 7 +/- 17, LFD 8 +/- 18 vs ND 0.1 +/- 15, P = 0.13. 
      CONCLUSION: Both LFD and LGG are efficatious in patients with IBS.

TI  - Non-celiac gluten hypersensitivity.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in 
      recent years. The condition is characterized by both gastrointestinal and
      extra-intestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal. Most of the symptoms
      are subjective and for many years such patients remain in a diagnostic dilemma.
      Although symptomalogy is similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), NCGS is now
      regarded as a distinct clinical entity. However, the disease pathology is not
      well elucidated and our knowledge of NCGS is still very rudimentary. This review 
      highlights the importance of this new clinical entity, outlines its pathological 
      mechanisms and suggests a diagnostic algorithm for its management.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Successful treatment of patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) often remains elusive. Recent studies in Australia, the United
      Kingdom and New Zealand have suggested the efficacy of a diet low in fermentable 
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in the
      management of these patients. The aims of this study were to determine whether a 
      diet low in FODMAPs improves symptoms in patients with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in Spain and to analyze the predictors of a
      good response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
      consecutive patients with FGID type IBS and functioanl abdominal bloating. At
      inclusion all patients underwent an assessment through a baseline demographic
      questionnaire of symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life. A
      hydrogen breath test with lactose and fructose was performed and a low FODMAPs
      diet was indicated for 2 months by expert dietitians. These tests were taken as a
      reference. A positive response was defined as an improvement of at least 5 points
      out of a possible 10 in the symptom questionnaire. RESULTS: We included 30
      patients (24 women, 39 [12] years). The response to the low FODMAPs diet was
      positive in controlling overall symptoms and specific symptoms such as functioanl
      abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and fatigue in
      more than 70% of patients (P<.05). By contrast, constipation was controlled in
      only 48% of patients (P>.05). Adherence to the diet was good in 87% of patients
      and was a predictor of positive response in the univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      A diet low in FODMAPs is associated with symptom improvement in patients with IBS
      and functioanl abdominal bloating. Adherence to the diet was a determining
      factor.

TI  - Relationship between fructose and lactose intakes and functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms in a sample of 50-year-old Cantabrians in New Zealand.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - AIMS: To examine the relationship between fructose and lactose consumption and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in 50-year-old adults residing in
      Canterbury, New Zealand. METHODS: The Canterbury Health Ageing and Life Course
      (CHALICE) study is a study of 50-year-old Cantabrians. A 4-day estimated food and
      beverage diary (FBD) was completed by 227 participants, 75.7% of those recruited.
      The Birmingham IBS symptom questionnaire was administered and individual
      participant scores were calculated for constipation, diarrhoea, pain score, and
      total symptom score. Associations between symptoms and the intake of fructose and
      lactose were examined using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Greater mean
      daily intakes of fructose (P=0.05) and lactose (P=0.04) were associated with a
      lower prevalence of IBS pain symptoms after adjusting for demographics and social
      economic status. However there was no evidence of an association with
      constipation, diarrhoea or total IBS score. CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show
      inverse relationships between fructose and lactose intakes and IBS pain symptoms,
      the use of cross-sectional data do not allow us to determine causality in these
      relationships. However it is possible that participants may have reduced their
      intake of fructose and lactose in response to IBS related pain. Follow up of this
      cohort would allow us to determine if this is the case. Future research could
      also investigate whether people with IBS could benefit from guidance from a
      dietitian around consumption of high lactose or fructose-containing foods.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gluten is a glycoprotein present in some cereals. The incidence of 
      disorders related to gluten, including the EC, is increasing, even pathologies
      far from an etiology or treatment with GF D. AIMS: Review the scientific
      literature related to the ingestion of gluten and pathogenesis of different
      diseases. METHODS: A literature search in major scientific database. RESULTS: We 
      obtained from the following diseases, gluten ataxia, multiple sclerosis, autism
      spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      depressive disorders, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia,
      dermatitis herpetiformis and epilepsy, studies in which either a determination of
      gliadin was refered or a treatment, with/without gluten, was applied and
      evaluated. CONCLUSION: The ingestion of gluten seems to be related to disease,
      when there is no EC, SGNC or wheat allergy. Suspicions about the benefit of GF D 
      as a complementary treatment is borne in semi-clinical trials and cohorts, either
      as a causal factor in the pathogenesis, or improvement of symptoms.

TI  - Risk of low bone mineral density and low body mass index in patients with
      non-celiac wheat-sensitivity: a prospective observation study.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/s12916-014-0230-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or 'wheat sensitivity' (NCWS) is
      included in the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. No data are available on
      the prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in NCWS. Our study aims to evaluate
      the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients and search for correlations with other
      clinical characteristics. METHODS: This prospective observation study included 75
      NCWS patients (63 women; median age 36 years) with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-like symptoms, 65 IBS and 50 celiac controls. Patients were recruited at
      two Internal Medicine Departments. Elimination diet and double-blind placebo
      controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge proved the NCWS diagnosis. All subjects
      underwent BMD assessment by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), duodenal
      histology, HLA DQ typing, body mass index (BMI) evaluation and assessment for
      daily calcium intake. RESULTS: DBPC cow's milk proteins challenge showed that 30 
      of the 75 NCWS patients suffered from multiple food sensitivity. Osteopenia and
      osteoporosis frequency increased from IBS to NCWS and to celiac disease (CD) (P
      <0.0001). Thirty-five NCWS patients (46.6%) showed osteopenia or osteoporosis.
      Low BMD was related to low BMI and multiple food sensitivity. Values of daily
      dietary calcium intake in NCWS patients were significantly lower than in IBS
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated frequency of bone mass loss in NCWS patients
      was found; this was related to low BMI and was more frequent in patients with
      NCWS associated with other food sensitivity. A low daily intake of dietary
      calcium was observed in patients with NCWS.

TI  - Low-FODMAP Diet for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Is It Ready for Prime Time?
PG  - 1169-77
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3436-4 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease, which
      adversely affects the quality of life. Its prevalence has been reported to be
      around 10-15 % in North America and constitutes the most common cause for
      gastroenterology referral. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of IBS is not
      completely understood. Not surprisingly, the management strategies can leave the 
      patients with inadequate symptom control, making IBS a debilitating
      gastrointestinal syndrome. Dietary interventions as a treatment strategy for IBS 
      have been recently evaluated. One such intervention includes dietary restriction 
      of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs
      define a group of short-chain carbohydrates that are incompletely absorbed in
      small intestine and later fermented in the colon. Evidence in the form of
      randomized controlled trials and observational studies have evaluated the
      mechanism of action and efficacy of low-FODMAP diet. This dietary intervention
      has showed promising results in symptom reduction in IBS patients. However,
      latest trials have also shown that the low-FODMAP diet is associated with marked 
      changes in gut microbiota specifically reduction in microbiota with prebiotic
      properties. Implications of such changes on gastrointestinal health need to be
      further evaluated in future trials.

TI  - Intestinal permeability--a new target for disease prevention and therapy.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12876-014-0189-7 [doi]
AB  - Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier
      and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are
      poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical
      significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge
      on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. 
      First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are 
      defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting
      permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where
      billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand,
      an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of
      microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb
      essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex
      anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the
      functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the 
      regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In
      particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut,
      infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other
      lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess 
      intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary
      enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier.
      The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this
      functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other
      environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated
      with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory
      bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more
      recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are
      characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of
      luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a
      feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of
      relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more
      attention.

AB  - The controversial effects of dietary fiber on symptoms in functional
      gastrointestinal disorders are summarized. Studies concerning adverse reaction to
      foods are mentioned and the possible role of food allergy and food intolerances, 
      especially pseudoallergic reactions to biogenes amines, in symptom provocation is
      discussed. The known effects of lactose deficiency and fructose malabsorption are
      reviewed. The FODMAP concept (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and
      polyols) is presented in more detail and recent studies on pathophysiological
      effects of FODMAP constituents and of therapeutic effects of a low FODMAP diet on
      symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are discussed. Finally,
      studies on the new disorder non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are summarized
      and the state of the discussion whether wheat intolerance is due to gluten or the
      grains is given.

AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

TI  - Bloating and functional gastro-intestinal disorders: where are we and where are
      we going?

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i39.14407 [doi]
AB  - Bloating is one of the most common and bothersome symptoms complained by a large 
      proportion of patients. This symptom has been described with various definitions,
      such as sensation of a distended abdomen or an abdominal tension or even
      excessive gas in the abdomen, although bloating should probably be defined as the
      feeling (e.g. a subjective sensation) of increased pressure within the abdomen.
      It is usually associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders, like
      irritable bowel syndrome, but when bloating is not part of another functional
      bowel or gastrointestinal disorder it is included as an independent entity in
      Rome III criteria named functional bloating. In terms of diagnosis, major
      difficulties are due to the lack of measurable parameters to assess and grade
      this symptom. In addition, it is still unclear to what extent the individual
      patient complaint of subjective bloating correlates with the objective evidence
      of abdominal distension. In fact, despite its clinical, social and economic
      relevance, bloating lacks a clear pathophysiology explanation, and an effective
      management endorsement, turning this common symptom into a true challenge for
      both patients and clinicians. Different theories on bloating etiology call into
      questions an increased luminal contents (gas, stools, liquid or fat) and/or an
      impaired abdominal empting and/or an altered intra-abdominal volume displacement 
      (abdomino-phrenic theory) and/or an increased perception of intestinal stimuli
      with a subsequent use of empirical treatments (diet modifications, antibiotics
      and/or probiotics, prokinetic drugs, antispasmodics, gas reducing agents and
      tricyclic antidepressants). In this review, our aim was to review the latest
      knowledge on bloating physiopathology and therapeutic options trying to shed
      lights on those processes where a clinician could intervene to modify disease
      course.

TI  - Differentiating coeliac disease from irritable bowel syndrome by urinary volatile
      organic compound analysis--a pilot study.
PG  - e107312
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0107312 [doi]
AB  - Coeliac disease (CD), a T-cell-mediated gluten sensitive enteropathy, affects
      approximately 1% of the UK population and can present with wide ranging clinical 
      features, often being mistaken for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Heightened
      clinical awareness and serological screening identifies those with potential
      coeliac disease; the diagnosis is confirmed with duodenal biopsies, and symptom
      improvement with a gluten-free diet. Limitations to diagnosis are false negative 
      serology and reluctance to undergo biopsy. The gut microbiome is altered in
      several gastrointestinal disorders, causing altered gut fermentation patterns
      recognisable by volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis in urine, breath and
      faeces. We aimed to determine if CD alters the urinary VOC pattern,
      distinguishing it from IBS. 47 patients were recruited, 27 with established CD,
      on gluten free diets, and 20 with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Collected
      urine was stored frozen in 10 ml aliquots. For assay, the specimens were heated
      to 40 +/- 0.1 degrees C and the headspace analysed by Field Asymmetric Ion
      Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS). Machine learning algorithms were used for
      statistical evaluation. Samples were also analysed using Gas chromatography and
      mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Sparse logistic regression showed that FAIMS
      distinguishes VOCs in CD vs D-IBS with ROC curve AUC of 0.91 (0.83-0.99),
      sensitivity and specificity of 85% respectively. GCMS showed a unique peak at
      4'67 found only in CD, not D-IBS, which correlated with the compound 1,3,5,7
      cyclooctatetraene. This study suggests that FAIMS offers a novel, non-invasive
      approach to identify those with possible CD, and distinguishes from D-IBS. It
      offers the potential for monitoring compliance with a gluten-free diet at home.
      The presence of cyclooctatetraene in CD specimens will need further validation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence concerning disordered eating practices
      in dietary-controlled gastrointestinal conditions. Three key questions were
      examined: a) are disordered eating practices a feature of GI disorders?; b) what 
      abnormal eating practices are present in those with GI disorders?; and c) what
      factors are associated with the presence of disordered eating in those with GI
      disorders? By exploring these questions, we aim to develop a conceptual model of 
      disordered eating development in GI disease. METHODS: Five key databases, Web of 
      Science with Conference Proceedings (1900-2014) and MEDLINE (1950-2014), PubMed, 
      PsycINFO (1967-2014) and Google Scholar, were searched for papers relating to
      disordered eating practices in those with GI disorders. All papers were quality
      assessed before being included in the review. RESULTS: Nine papers were included 
      in the review. The majority of papers reported that the prevalence of disordered 
      eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations
      of healthy controls. Disordered eating patterns in dietary-controlled GI
      disorders may be associated with both anxiety and GI symptoms. Evidence
      concerning the correlates of disordered eating was limited. CONCLUSIONS: The
      presence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI
      disorders than in populations of healthy controls, but the direction of the
      relationship is not clear. Implications for further research are discussed.

AB  - This article discusses the studies on functional and motor gastrointestinal
      disorders presented at the 2014 Digestive Diseases Week conference that are of
      greatest interest to us. New data have been provided on the clinical importance
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders, with recent prevalence data for
      irritable bowel syndrome and fecal incontinence. We know more about the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of the various functional disorders, especially
      irritable bowel syndrome, which has had the largest number of studies. Thus, we
      have gained new data on microinflammation, genetics, microbiota, psychological
      aspects, etc. Symptoms such as abdominal distension have gained interest in the
      scientific community, both in terms of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and
      those with constipation. From the diagnostic point of view, the search continues 
      for a biomarker for functional gastrointestinal disorders, especially for
      irritable bowel syndrome. In the therapeutic area, the importance of diet for
      these patients (FODMAP, fructans, etc.) is once again confirmed, and data is
      provided that backs the efficacy of already marketed drugs such as linaclotide,
      which rule out the use of other drugs such as mesalazine for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. This year, new forms of drug administration have been
      presented, including metoclopramide nasal sprays and granisetron transdermal
      patches for patients with gastroparesis. Lastly, a curiosity that caught our
      attention was the use of a vibrating capsule to stimulate gastrointestinal
      transit in patients with constipation.

TI  - The role of food intolerance in functional gastrointestinal disorders in
      children.
PG  - 686-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) is a common, benign,
      chronic diagnosis that has a significant negative impact on quality of life.
      FGIDs that develop in childhood can persist into adulthood. Currently, there is
      no cure and few treatment options are available. OBJECTIVE: This article provides
      an outline of current research supporting the role of food intolerance in
      children with FGIDs. DISCUSSION: Food intolerances have long been reported by
      patients with FGIDs; however, randomised controlled trials are lacking in this
      area. Food intolerances that have been investigated include intolerance to food
      chemicals, lactose, fructose and, more recently, fer-mentable carbohydrates,
      termed FODMAPs. The low-FODMAP diet eliminates poorly absorbed short-chain
      carbohydrates and has a clearly defined mechanism of action. Emerging evidence
      suggests it alleviates symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and,
      potentially, also in children. However, more evidence is required for the
      efficacy of the diet in children and in oth-er subgroups of FGID. Any dietary
      restriction in growing children should be undertaken with clinical supervision by
      a dietitian.

PG  - 605-9

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition affecting
      approximately 10-15% of Western populations. The Rome III criteria are applied to
      many studies to validate the diagnosis of IBS. The low fermentable oligo, di,
      monosaccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet has been the subject of many robust
      clinical trials and is now used as the primary dietary therapy internationally.
      This review examines the current evidence for the role of the low FODMAP diet in 
      IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Detailed commentary on original research involving FODMAPs 
      and IBS symptoms from 2013 to 2014 is provided. SUMMARY: The low FODMAP diet has 
      been shown to be an efficacious therapy for reduction of functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms seen in IBS. Recent publications provide randomized
      controlled trial and prospective observational evidence in support of the diet
      for symptom management. The low FODMAP diet appears to be superior to a
      gluten-free diet in people with self-reported nonceliac gluten sensitivity.
      Although the low FODMAP diet has not been shown to reduce the prebiotic effect in
      the colon, total colonic bacterial load was reduced. Further research
      investigating the potential health implications of both this and the nutritional 
      adequacy of the liberalized low FODMAP diet is required.

PG  - 142-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most prevalent functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. It is a multifactorial disorder with its pathogenesis
      attributed to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation,
      visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on.
      Traditionally, IBS has been treated with diet and lifestyle modification, fiber
      supplementation, psychological therapy, and pharmacological treatment.
      Carbohydrates are intermingled with a wide range of regularly consumed food
      including grains such as rye and wheat, vegetables, fruits, and legumes.
      Short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the
      intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by
      bacteria with consequent gas production. These effects may be the basis for the
      induction of most of the gastrointestinal symptoms. This has led to the use of
      lactose-free diets in those with lactose intolerance and of fructose-reduced
      diets for fructose malabsorption. As all poorly absorbed short-chain
      carbohydrates have similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has
      been developed to regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a
      dietary approach that restricts them all. Based on the observational and
      comparative studies, and randomized-controlled trials, FODMAPs have been shown to
      trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. Food choice via the low
      FODMAPs and potentially other dietary strategies is now a realistic and
      efficacious therapeutic approach for managing symptoms of IBS.

AB  - A chronic continuous or intermittent gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, the
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), appears to be due to dysregulation of
      brain-gut-microbiota communication. Furthermore, the "microbiota" greatly impacts
      the bi-directional brain-gut axis communication. This article describes IBS in
      relation to similar diseases, presents the background to osteopathy, and proposes
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to manage IBS. In IBS, OMT focuses on
      the nervous and circulatory systems, spine, viscera, and thoracic and pelvic
      diaphragms in order to restore homeostatic balance, normalize autonomic activity 
      in the intestine, promote lymphatic flow, and address somatic dysfunction.
      Lymphatic and venous congestion are treated by the lymphatic pump techniques and 
      stimulation of Chapmans reflex points. A simple treatment plan designed to lessen
      chronic pain and inflammation in IBS is presented based on current evidence-based
      literature. Since food itself, food allergies, and intolerance could contribute
      to symptom onset or even cause IBS, this article also provides dietary
      modifications to consider for patients.

PG  - 6328
LID - 10.1038/srep06328 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota (GM) consists of resident commensals and transient microbes
      conveyed by the diet but little is known about the role of the latter on GM
      homeostasis. Here we show, by a conjunction of quantitative metagenomics, in
      silico genome reconstruction and metabolic modeling, that consumption of a
      fermented milk product containing dairy starters and Bifidobacterium animalis
      potentiates colonic short chain fatty acids production and decreases abundance of
      a pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia compared to a milk product in subjects with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, n = 28). The GM changes parallel improvement of
      IBS state, suggesting a role of the fermented milk bacteria in gut homeostasis.
      Our data challenge the view that microbes ingested with food have little impact
      on the human GM functioning and rather provide support for beneficial health
      effects.

      enteropathy.
PG  - 11713-26
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11713 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for a multitude of digestive and immune
      functions which depend upon the balanced interaction of the intestinal
      microbiota, diet, gut barrier function, and mucosal immune response. Disruptions 
      in one or more of these factors can lead to intestinal disorders or enteropathies
      which are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability,
      and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Enteropathy is frequently associated
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, inflammatory bowel disease,
      autoimmune enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 
      where pathologic changes in the intestinal tract lead to abdominal discomfort,
      bloating, abnormal bowel function (e.g., diarrhea, urgency, constipation and
      malabsorption). Unfortunately, effective therapies for the management of
      enteropathy and restoring intestinal health are still not available. An
      accumulating body of preclinical studies has demonstrated that oral
      administration of plasma- or serum-derived protein concentrates containing high
      levels of immunoglobulins can improve weight, normalize gut barrier function, and
      reduce the severity of enteropathy in animal models. Recent studies in humans,
      using serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate, demonstrate that such 
      protein preparations are safe and improve symptoms, nutritional status, and
      various biomarkers associated with enteropathy. Benefits have been shown in
      patients with HIV infection or diarrhea-predominant IBS. This review summarizes
      preclinical and clinical studies with plasma/serum protein concentrates and
      describes the effects on host nutrition, intestinal function, and markers of
      intestinal inflammation. It supports the concept that immunoglobulin-containing
      protein preparations may offer a new strategy for restoring functional
      homeostasis in the intestinal tract of patients with enteropathy.

TI  - Fasting and postprandial gastric sensorimotor activity in functional dyspepsia:
      postprandial distress vs. epigastric pain syndrome.
PG  - 1631-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.231 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little information is available on the mechanisms responsible for
      dyspeptic symptoms in postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), characterized by the 
      presence of prevalently meal-related early satiation and fullness, and the
      epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), characterized by the prominent symptom of
      epigastric pain, generally not meal related. In a group of PDS patients, the
      presence of hypersensitivity to gastric distension in both fasting and
      postprandial phases was described as the main pathophysiological mechanism; on
      the contrary, we have no information on the pathophysiology of EPS. METHODS:
      Sixty Helicobacter pylori (HP)-negative, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-negative,
      and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-negative patients with functional
      dyspepsia according to Rome III criteria underwent symptom, anxiety, depression, 
      and somatization evaluation, gastric barostat test, and gastric emptying time
      evaluation for solids. Fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) were
      also enrolled as a control group. RESULTS: In PDS patients, the prevalence of
      both fasting and postprandial hypersensitivity was higher than in EPS patients,
      and the extent of postprandial reduction of discomfort threshold was
      significantly correlated with symptom severity. In EPS patients, gastric volume
      at fasting discomfort threshold and fasting compliance were significantly lower
      than in PDS patients. Gastric emptying time and gastric accommodation were
      similar between the two dyspeptic groups. Dyspeptic patients showed a higher
      prevalence of psychiatric disorders than HVs, but the prevalence was similar
      between PDS and EPS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting and postprandial
      hypersensitivity characterize PDS patients and a reduction of gastric compliance 
      is present in EPS patients. However, the pathophysiology of EPS appears more
      complex than PDS and further studies are needed to analyze central processing and
      integration of afferent pathways in order to clarify the role of the central
      nervous system in this condition.

      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

LID - 10.3892/mmr.2014.2498 [doi]
AB  - The gut endocrine cells control and regulate several functions of the
      gastrointestinal tract. They have been reported to be abnormal in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), with alterations occurring in several functions regulated by
      these cells. Furthermore, it has been established that gut endocrine cells
      interact with the gut lumen contents, particularly the nutrients. The present
      study was undertaken to establish whether the positive outcome of dietary
      guidance observed in patients suffering from IBS is associated with a change in
      gastric endocrine cells. A total of 46 patients with IBS participated in the
      present study, of which 14 completed all aspects. These patients included nine
      females and five males with a mean age of 34 years (range, 2045 years). In the
      healthy control group, nine females and five males, with a mean age of 54 years
      (range 2670 years) were selected. The patients and controls underwent gastroscopy
      with biopsy samples taken from the corpus and antrum of the stomach. Each patient
      attended three sessions that lasted ~45 min each, and received individual
      guidance on their dietary management. The patients followed the diet prescribed
      for a minimum of three months, then further samples were taken using a method
      similar to that used for the initial biopsies. The biopsy samples were
      immunostained using the avidinbiotin complex method for chromogranin A (CgA) and 
      quantified by computerized image analysis. The patients with IBS presented a low 
      density of CgA compared with the controls. The density of CgA increased in these 
      patients following dietary guidance and changes in food intake. The present
      observations emphasized the interaction between food intake and gut endocrine
      cells. The current study also suggests that the positive effects of dietary
      guidance may be attributed to changes in gut endocrine cell density.

TI  - Effect of one year of a gluten-free diet on the clinical evolution of irritable
      bowel syndrome plus fibromyalgia in patients with associated lymphocytic
      enteritis: a case-control study.
PG  - 421
LID - 10.1186/s13075-014-0421-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lymphocytic enteritis (LE) and
      fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) are three common disorders. Since a gluten-free diet 
      (GFD) has been shown to be helpful in LE, we aimed to assess its effect in a
      series of LE patients also diagnosed with IBS and FMS. METHODS: The study sample 
      comprised 97 IBS plus FMS adult females, of whom 58 had LE (Marsh stage 1), and
      39 had a normal duodenal biopsy (Marsh stage 0). All patients fulfilled the Rome 
      III and American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria. All participants followed
      a GFD, the effectiveness of which was assessed by changes in the results of
      several tests, including those of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ),
      the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), tender points (TPs), the Short Form
      Health Survey (SF-36), and the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal 
      complaints, pain and fatigue. RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had a poor
      quality of life (QoL) and high VAS scores. After one year on a GFD, all outcome
      measures were somewhat better in the Marsh stage 1 group, with a mean decrease of
      26 to 29% in the TPs, FIQ, HAQ and VAS scales, accompanied by an increase of 27% 
      in the SF-36 physical and mental component scores. However, in the IBS plus
      FMS/Marsh stage 0 group, the GFD had almost no effect. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot
      study shows that a GFD in the LE-related IBS/FMS subgroup of patients can produce
      a slight but significant improvement in all symptoms. Our findings suggest that
      further studies of this subject are warranted.

TI  - Dietary requirement for serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins in the clinical
      management of patients with enteropathy.
PG  - 13-23
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3322-0 [doi]
AB  - A variety of human disease conditions are associated with chronic intestinal
      disorders or enteropathies that are characterized by intestinal inflammation,
      increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Such
      disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to
      symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and
      malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in
      understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between 
      the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying
      immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during
      enteropathy are still not available. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
      ability of oral immunoglobulins to improve weight gain, support gut barrier
      function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animals. More recently,
      studies in humans provide evidence that serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin/protein isolate is safe and improves nutritional status and GI
      symptoms in patients with enteropathy associated with irritable bowel syndrome or
      infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. This review summarizes studies
      showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially
      formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and
      nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein
      preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary
      management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have
      limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs
      or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements
      that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.

TI  - Serum regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha is a biomarker of mucosal enteropathies.
PG  - 974-81
LID - 10.1111/apt.12920 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of organic and functional intestinal
      disorders can overlap and clinicians often rely on invasive and time-consuming
      procedures to make a final diagnosis. Regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha
      (Reg3alpha) is detectable in the circulation of patients with intestinal
      graft-versus host disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      AIM: To determine whether serum Reg3alpha testing is useful for discriminating
      mucosal enteropathies from functional intestinal disorders. METHODS: We
      prospectively included 47 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), 13 patients
      with refractory coeliac disease (RCD), seven patients with common variable
      immunodeficiency (CVID), 72 patients with active Crohn's disease, 22 patients
      with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-related diarrhoea. Sera were also taken from 10 CD patients before and
      after 6-12 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from 14 patients with IBD
      before and after induction therapy with Infliximab (IFX). Sera of 119 healthy
      volunteers were used to determine the cut-off value. Reg3alpha levels were
      measured by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: Levels of Reg3alpha exceeded the
      cut-off value of the assay in 43/47(91%) ACD patients, 13/13(100%) RCD patients, 
      7/7(100%) CVID patients, 65/72(90%) Crohn's disease patients, 17/22(77%) UC
      patients and one patient with IBS(4%). Reg3alpha levels distinguished mucosal
      enteropathies from IBS with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%.
      Reg3alpha levels significantly decreased in CD patients following a GFD and in
      IBD patients after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Reg3alpha is a serum biomarker
      of intestinal damage that, combined with clinical data, identifies patients who
      should undergo invasive tests for diagnosing enteropathies.

TI  - Effect of dietary management on the gastric endocrine cells in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 519-24
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gastric endocrine cells in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) tend to normalize following dietary guidance. The aim of the
      present study was to identify the gastric endocrine cell types that are changed
      following such dietary guidance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fourteen IBS patients and 14
      healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of 
      individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the
      controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9
      months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were
      immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were
      quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin 
      cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were
      149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 
      +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the
      gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/-
      24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of
      serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4
      and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI
      18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the
      somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/-
      3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 
      22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell
      types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a 
      change in food intake.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: contemporary nutrition management strategies.
PG  - 781-99
LID - 10.1177/0148607114545329 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a complex disorder whose pathophysiology involves
      alterations in the enteric microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, gut
      immune/barrier function, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation,
      neurotransmitters, stress response, psychological factors, and more. The
      importance of diet in the management of irritable bowel syndrome has taken center
      stage in recent times as the literature validates the relationship of certain
      foods with the provocation of symptoms. Likewise, a number of elimination dietary
      programs have been successful in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
      Knowledge of the dietary management strategies for irritable bowel syndrome will 
      help guide nutritionists and healthcare practitioners to deliver optimal
      outcomes. This tutorial reviews the nutrition management strategies for irritable
      bowel syndrome.

TI  - Confocal endomicroscopy shows food-associated changes in the intestinal mucosa of
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated suspected food intolerances in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for
      real-time visualization of structural/functional changes in the intestinal mucosa
      after food challenge. Patients with functional changes after food challenge
      (CLE+) were placed on personalized exclusion diets and followed up for long-term 
      symptom relief. METHODS: Thirty-six IBS patients with suspected food intolerance 
      and 10 patients with Barrett's esophagus (controls) without IBS symptoms were
      examined by CLE at University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany).
      Diluted food antigens were administered directly to the duodenal mucosa through
      the working channel of the endoscope. Epithelial breaks, intervillous spaces, and
      the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were measured before and after
      the food challenge. CLE+ patients were placed on exclusion diets, given symptom
      score questionnaires, and followed up for 1 year; controls resumed their previous
      diet. RESULTS: CLE showed a real-time response to food antigens in 22 of 36
      patients; no responses were observed in 14 of 36 patients (CLE-) or any of the
      controls. Baseline IELs were significantly higher in CLE+ than CLE- subjects (P =
      .004); numbers increased significantly after food challenge (P = .0008). Within 5
      minutes of exposure of CLE+ patients to food antigens, IELs increased, epithelial
      leaks/gaps formed, and intervillous spaces widened. Epithelial leaks and
      intervillous spaces also increased significantly in CLE+ vs baseline (both P <
      .001). The concordance of IELs measured by CLE and conventional histology was
      70.6%; they did not correlate (P = .89; r(2) = 0.027). Symptom scores improved
      more than 50% in CLE+ patients after a 4-week exclusion diet and increased to 74%
      at 12 months; symptoms continued in CLE- patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CLE
      analysis of IBS patients with a suspected food intolerance, exposure to candidate
      food antigens caused immediate breaks, increased intervillous spaces, and
      increased IELs in the intestinal mucosa. These changes are associated with
      patient responses to exclusion diets. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov
      (registration number: NCT01692613).

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders in Western countries. Despite the high prevalence of this disorders,
      the therapeutic management of these patients is often unsatisfactory. A number of
      factors have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS, including 
      impaired motility and sensitivity, increased permeability, changes in the gut
      microbiome and alterations in the brain-gut axis. Also food seems to play a
      critical role: the most of IBS patients report the onset or the exacerbation of
      their symptoms after the meals. Recently, an increasing attention has been paid
      to the role of food in IBS. In this review we summarize the most recent evidences
      about the role of diet on IBS symptoms. A diet restricted in fermentable, poorly 
      absorbed carbohydrates and sugar alcohols has beneficial effects on IBS symptoms.
      More studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the relationship between
      food and IBS. However, in the foreseeable future, dietary strategies will
      represent one of the key tools in the therapeutic management of patients with
      IBS.

TI  - The effect of fiber supplementation on irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1367-74
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.195 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fiber has been used for many years to treat irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS). This approach had fallen out of favor until a recent resurgence, which was
      based on new randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that suggested it might be
      effective. We have previously conducted a systematic review of fiber in IBS, but 
      new RCT data for fiber therapy necessitate a new analysis; thus, we have
      conducted a systematic review of this intervention. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
      the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched up to December 2013. Trials
      recruiting adults with IBS, which compared fiber supplements with placebo,
      control therapy, or "usual management", were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data
      were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy
      as well as number needed to treat (NNT) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
      RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs involving 906 patients that had evaluated fiber in
      IBS. There was a significant benefit of fiber in IBS (RR=0.86; 95% CI 0.80-0.94
      with an NNT=10; 95% CI=6-33). There was no significant heterogeneity between
      results (I(2)=0%, Cochran Q=13.85 (d.f.=14), P=0.46). The benefit was only seen
      in RCTs on soluble fiber (RR=0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.94 with an NNT=7; 95% CI 4-25)
      with no effect seen with bran (RR=0.90; 95% CI 0.79-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Soluble
      fiber is effective in treating IBS. Bran did not appear to be of benefit,
      although we did not uncover any evidence of harm from this intervention, as
      others have speculated from uncontrolled data.

TI  - Diets that differ in their FODMAP content alter the colonic luminal
      microenvironment.
PG  - 93-100
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307264 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides,
      Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet reduces symptoms of IBS, but reduction of
      potential prebiotic and fermentative effects might adversely affect the colonic
      microenvironment. The effects of a low FODMAP diet with a typical Australian diet
      on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a single-blinded, randomised,
      cross-over trial. DESIGN: Twenty-seven IBS and six healthy subjects were randomly
      allocated one of two 21-day provided diets, differing only in FODMAP content
      (mean (95% CI) low 3.05 (1.86 to 4.25) g/day vs Australian 23.7 (16.9 to 30.6)
      g/day), and then crossed over to the other diet with >/=21-day washout period.
      Faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on their habitual diet and from day 17 to day
      21 of the interventional diets were pooled, and pH, short-chain fatty acid
      concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed. RESULTS:
      Faecal indices were similar in IBS and healthy subjects during habitual diets.
      The low FODMAP diet was associated with higher faecal pH (7.37 (7.23 to 7.51) vs.
      7.16 (7.02 to 7.30); p=0.001), similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations,
      greater microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance (9.63 (9.53 to 
      9.73) vs. 9.83 (9.72 to 9.93) log10 copies/g; p<0.001) compared with the
      Australian diet. To indicate direction of change, in comparison with the habitual
      diet the low FODMAP diet reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical
      Australian diet increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing Clostridium
      cluster XIVa (median ratio 6.62; p<0.001) and mucus-associated Akkermansia
      muciniphila (19.3; p<0.001), and reduced Ruminococcus torques. CONCLUSIONS: Diets
      differing in FODMAP content have marked effects on gut microbiota composition.
      The implications of long-term reduction of intake of FODMAPs require elucidation.

PG  - 1593-609
LID - 10.1517/14712598.2014.937419 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Saccharomyces boulardii is a well-known probiotic worldwide, and
      there are numerous studies including experimental and clinical trials in children
      and adults by the use of S. boulardii. AREAS COVERED: The objective of the
      present report is to provide an update on the evidence for the efficacy of S.
      boulardii CNCM I-745 in different clinical conditions. Saccharomyces boulardii is
      one of the best-studied probiotics in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and is shown to
      be safe and to reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization by about 1
      day. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the recommended probiotics for AGE in
      children by European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).
      Saccharomyces boulardii is also a recommended probiotic for the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and a recent study showed promising results
      for the treatment of AAD in children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend
      the long-term use of S. boulardii in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
      Although some clinical studies showed positive effects of S. boulardii on
      inflammation, there is no clinical evidence that S. boulardii is useful in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Saccharomyces boulardii could be used in patients
      needing Helicobacter pylori eradication because the S. boulardii improves
      compliance, decreases the side effects and moderately increases the eradication
      rate. There are new promising results (improving feeding tolerance, shorten the
      course of hyperbilirubinemia), but we do still not recommend the routine use of
      S. boulardii in newborns. EXPERT OPINION: Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a
      good example for the statement that each probiotic needs to be taxonomically
      characterized and its efficacy and safety should be documented individually in
      different clinical settings.

TI  - Patient perception of treatment burden is high in celiac disease compared with
      other common conditions.
PG  - 1304-11
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.29 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is life-long adherence to 
      a gluten-free diet (GFD). Noncompliance is associated with signs and symptoms of 
      CD, yet long-term adherence rates are poor. It is not known how the burden of the
      GFD compares with other medical treatments, and there are limited data on the
      socioeconomic factors influencing treatment adherence. In this study, we compared
      treatment burden and health state in CD compared with other chronic illnesses and
      evaluated the relationship between treatment burden and adherence. METHODS:
      Survey was mailed to participants with CD, gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension (HTN),
      diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD) on dialysis. Surveys included demographic information and visual analog
      scales measuring treatment burden, importance of treatment, disease-specific
      health status, and overall health status. RESULTS: We collected surveys from 341 
      celiac and 368 non-celiac participants. Celiac participants reported high
      treatment burden, greater than participants with GERD or HTN and comparable to
      ESRD. Conversely, patients with CD reported the highest health state of all
      groups. Factors associated with high treatment burden in CD included poor
      adherence, concern regarding food cost, eating outside the home, higher income,
      lack of college education, and time limitations in preparing food. Poor adherence
      in CD was associated with increased symptoms, income, and low perceived
      importance of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with CD have high treatment
      burden but also excellent overall health status in comparison with other chronic 
      medical conditions. The significant burden of dietary therapy for CD argues for
      the need for safe adjuvant treatment, as well as interventions designed to lower 
      the perceived burden of the GFD.

      excreted in the breath. These tests are used in the diagnosis of carbohydrate
      malabsorption, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and for measuring the
      orocecal transit time. Malabsorption of carbohydrates is a key trigger of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms such as diarrhea and/or
      constipation, bloating, excess flatulence, headaches and lack of energy.
      Abdominal bloating is a common nonspecific symptom which can negatively impact
      quality of life. It may reflect dietary imbalance, such as excess fiber intake,
      or may be a manifestation of IBS. However, bloating may also represent small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients with persistent symptoms of abdominal
      bloating and distension despite dietary interventions should be referred for H(2)
      breath testing to determine the presence or absence of bacterial overgrowth. If
      bacterial overgrowth is identified, patients are typically treated with
      antibiotics. Evaluation of IBS generally includes testing of other disorders that
      cause similar symptoms. Carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose, fructose, sorbitol) 
      can cause abdominal fullness, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and
      diarrhea, which are similar to the symptoms of IBS. However, it is unclear if
      these digestive disorders contribute to or cause the symptoms of IBS. Research
      studies show that a proper diagnosis and effective dietary intervention
      significantly reduces the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in 
      IBS. Thus, diagnosis of malabsorption of these carbohydrates in IBS using a
      breath test is very important to guide the clinician in the proper treatment of
      IBS patients.

AB  - Several endocrine cell abnormalities have been reported in different segments of 
      the gastrointestinal tract of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These
      cells have specialized microvilli that project into the lumen; they function as
      sensors for the gut contents and respond to luminal stimuli (mostly ingested
      nutrients) by releasing hormones into the lamina propria, where they exert their 
      effects via a paracrine/endocrine mode of action. Certain food items trigger the 
      symptoms experienced by IBS patients, including those rich in fermentable oligo-,
      di- and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In this review, we present the
      argument that the effects of both FODMAPs and the proportional intake of
      proteins, fats and carbohydrates on IBS symptoms may be caused by an interaction 
      with the gut endocrine cells. Since the gut hormones control and regulate
      gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this interaction may be responsible for 
      abnormal gastrointestinal motility and the visceral hypersensitivity observed in 
      these patients. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from
      food allergy. The role of gluten intolerance in the development of IBS symptoms
      in these patients remains a matter of controversy. Individual guidance on food
      management, which includes restrictions in the intake of FODMAP-rich foods and
      testing diets with different proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates has 
      been found to reduce the symptoms, improve the quality of life, and make the
      habitual diet of IBS patients more healthy.

PG  - 6680-4
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i21.6680 [doi]
AB  - In the present study we report on changes in irritable bowel syndrome-severity
      scoring system (IBS-SSS) and irritable bowel syndrome-quality of life (IBS-QoL)
      in 19 IBS patients, aged 18 to 74 years (F/M: 14/5), during 12 wk registering
      their symptoms on the web-application (www.ibs.constant-care.dk). During a
      control period of the first 6-wk patients were asked to register their IBS-SSS
      and IBS-QoL on the web-application weekly without receiving any intervention.
      Thereafter, low fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP)
      diet (LFD) was introduced for the next 6 wk while continuing the registration.
      Though a small sample size a significant improvement in disease activity
      (IBS-SSS) was observed during both the control period, median: 278 (range:
      122-377), P = 0.02, and subsequently during the LFD period, median: 151 (range:
      29-334), P < 0.01. The IBS-QoL solely changed significantly during the LFD
      period, median: 67 (37-120), P < 0.01. The significant reduction in disease
      activity during the control period shows a positive effect of the web-application
      on IBS symptoms when presented as a "traffic light". However adding the diet
      reduced IBS-SSS to < 150, inactive to mild symptoms. In the future results from
      larger scale trials are awaited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome
      with several unsettled issues despite the increasing awareness of its existence. 
      We carried out a prospective survey on NCGS in Italian centers for the diagnosis 
      of gluten-related disorders, with the aim of defining the clinical picture of
      this new syndrome and to establish roughly its prevalence compared with celiac
      disease. METHODS: From November 2012 to October 2013, 38 Italian centers (27
      adult gastroenterology, 5 internal medicine, 4 pediatrics, and 2 allergy)
      participated in this prospective survey. A questionnaire was used in order to
      allow uniform and accurate collection of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental 
      data. RESULTS: In total, 486 patients with suspected NCGS were identified in this
      1-year period. The female/male ratio was 5.4 to 1, and the mean age was 38 years 
      (range 3-81). The clinical picture was characterized by combined gastrointestinal
      (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain,
      gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and systemic manifestations
      (tiredness, headache, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      'foggy mind,' dermatitis or skin rash, depression, anxiety, and anemia). In the
      large majority of patients, the time lapse between gluten ingestion and the
      appearance of symptoms varied from a few hours to 1 day. The most frequent
      associated disorders were irritable bowel syndrome (47%), food intolerance (35%) 
      and IgE-mediated allergy (22%). An associated autoimmune disease was detected in 
      14% of cases. Regarding family history, 18% of our patients had a relative with
      celiac disease, but no correlation was found between NCGS and positivity for
      HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 25% of the patients
      tested. Only a proportion of patients underwent duodenal biopsy; for those that
      did, the biopsies showed normal intestinal mucosa (69%) or mild increase in
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (31%). The ratio between suspected NCGS and new CD
      diagnoses, assessed in 28 of the participating centers, was 1.15 to 1.
      CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey shows that NCGS has a strong correlation
      with female gender and adult age. Based on our results, the prevalence of NCGS
      seems to be only slightly higher than that of celiac disease.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a commonly recognized chronic disease in all
      healthcare settings. This integrative review investigated current knowledge about
      adults' illness-related experiences of this disease from the perspectives of
      everyday life, healthcare, and self-care management. The overarching findings
      related to everyday life with irritable bowel syndrome were life-limiting
      experiences of the body-self as unfamiliar and of the body and symptoms as
      shameful and unpredictable. The limitations manifested as lack of ability to move
      about freely, fulfill ambitions or commitments at work, maintain social
      activities, uphold or develop close and/or sexual relationships and parenting,
      and live a life with spontaneity. Physical condition, knowledge about
      disease/illness-related matters, and one's own perceived ability to find adequate
      strategies were significant for the ability of self-care management. Healthcare
      was experienced as being unsupportive and not providing information and guidance 
      for enabling self-care management. These results suggest a need for controlled
      intervention trials of healthcare models that take as their point of departure
      the individual's experience of illness, needs, and life situation, and that
      enable learning and sharing of illness experiences, combined with the provision
      of scientific knowledge and advice from healthcare professionals.

TI  - Treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1193-205
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0966-7 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a
      challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain
      specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results
      in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit
      their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line
      therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have
      been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable 
      carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to
      reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence
      for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy 
      of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different
      quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint
      oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS.
      Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although 
      the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis.
      In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion
      stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist
      that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the
      stool pattern.

      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 819-34
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2014.917956 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was previously left poorly treated despite its
      high prevalence and cost. Over the past decade, significant research has been
      conducted providing new dietary strategies for IBS management. The 'low
      fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet'
      has shown symptom improvement in 68-76% of patients. Randomized, controlled
      trials have now proven its efficacy. The diet, low in poorly absorbed and
      fermentable carbohydrates, uses dietary restriction and re-challenge to determine
      individual tolerance to various short-chain carbohydrates. However there may be
      potential detrimental effects of the diet in the long term, due to potential
      changes to the gastrointestinal microbiota. Appropriate dietary education and
      management of the diet is imperative. Future research should focus on the
      relevance of changes to the microbiota and ways to liberalize the dietary
      restrictions.

TI  - [The low FODMAP diet as a therapy for irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - A7407
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common, sometimes disabling disorder for
      which there is a lack of effective treatments. Many patients report that the
      make-up of the diet has an effect on their symptoms. The western diet consists of
      many different molecules. Some of them are small, fermentable and cannot be
      absorbed (FODMAPs). The low FODMAP diet was recently developed in Australia. In
      randomised controlled trials 37-45% of IBS patients experience symptom reduction 
      with this diet. The low FODMAP diet starts with a 6-week elimination phase. If
      symptoms decrease substantially, it is followed by a structured reintroduction
      phase of the various FODMAPs over several weeks, after which patients are left
      with a diet that is simpler to follow.

TI  - A role for the gut microbiota in IBS.
PG  - 497-505
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2014.40 [doi]
AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion of knowledge regarding the vast
      microbial community that resides within our intestine-the gut microbiota. The
      topic has generated great expectations in terms of gaining a better understanding
      of disorders ranging from IBD to metabolic disorders and obesity. IBS is a
      condition for which investigators have long been in search of plausible
      underlying pathogeneses and it is inevitable that altered composition or function
      of the gut microbiota will be considered as a potential aetiological factor in at
      least a subset of patients with IBS. This Review describes the evidence
      implicating the gut microbiota in not only the expression of the intestinal
      manifestations of IBS, but also the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 
      80% of patients with IBS. The evidence described herein ranges from
      proof-of-concept studies in animals to observational studies and clinical trials 
      in humans. The gut microbiota is subject to influences from a diverse range of
      factors including diet, antibiotic usage, infection and stress. These factors
      have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS and further prompt 
      consideration of a role for the gut microbiota in IBS.

TI  - Fibromyalgia and non-celiac gluten sensitivity: a description with remission of
      fibromyalgia.
PG  - 1607-12
LID - 10.1007/s00296-014-2990-6 [doi]
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a disabling clinical condition of unknown cause,
      and only symptomatic treatment with limited benefit is available. Gluten
      sensitivity that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease (CD)
      is increasingly recognized as a frequent and treatable condition with a wide
      spectrum of manifestations that overlap with the manifestations of FM, including 
      chronic musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of 
      this report was to describe 20 selected patients with FM without CD who improved 
      when placed on a gluten-free diet. An anti-transglutaminase assay, duodenal
      biopsy, and HLA typing were performed in all cases. CD was ruled out by negative 
      anti-transglutaminase assay results and absence of villous atrophy in the
      duodenal biopsy. All patients had intraepithelial lymphocytosis without villous
      atrophy. Clinical response was defined as achieving at least one of the following
      scenarios: remission of FM pain criteria, return to work, return to normal life, 
      or the discontinuation of opioids. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range
      5-31). This observation supports the hypothesis that non-celiac gluten
      sensitivity may be an underlying cause of FM syndrome.

PG  - e76-82
LID - 10.3928/00904481-20140325-08 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in children and adults. The
      pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IBS remains incompletely understood. The
      biopsychosocial model, which conceptualizes chronic pain as a dysregulation of
      the gut-brain-homeostasis with peripheral and central factors mutually
      influencing each other, is the most accepted framework to explain IBS. Twin and
      family aggregation studies suggest a genetic component that does not exclusively 
      explain the higher prevalence of IBS in certain families. Social learning
      (environmental factors) and maladaptive coping predispose children to develop IBS
      with greater disability and more frequent medical consultations. Early-life
      events constitute an additional risk factor for the development of IBS and other 
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Children with a history of cow's
      milk protein hypersensitivity or abdominal surgeries have a higher prevalence of 
      IBS and other FGIDs years later. IBS frequently follows an episode of acute
      gastrointestinal inflammation (infectious or non-infectious). This article
      discusses the importance, known pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical approach,
      and evidence-based therapeutic options for the management of IBS in children and 
      adolescents.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: gluten may cause depression in subjects with
      non-coeliac gluten sensitivity - an exploratory clinical study.
PG  - 1104-12
LID - 10.1111/apt.12730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported
      non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) retain gastrointestinal symptoms on a
      gluten-free diet (GFD) but continue to restrict gluten as they report 'feeling
      better'. AIM: To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those
      with NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal symptoms.
      METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (24-62 years, five male) with irritable bowel
      syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically controlled on 
      a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study. Participants randomly received 
      one of three dietary challenges for 3 days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout
      before crossing over to the next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was
      supplemented with gluten (16 g/day), whey (16 g/day) or not supplemented
      (placebo). End-points included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State 
      Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal
      symptoms. RESULTS: Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state
      depression scores compared to placebo [M = 2.03, 95% CI (0.55-3.51), P = 0.010]
      but not whey [M = 1.48, 95% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P = 0.07]. No differences were
      found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI trait measures. No difference 
      in cortisol secretion was identified between challenges. Gastrointestinal
      symptoms were induced similarly across all dietary challenges. CONCLUSIONS:
      Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of depression
      with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition. Gluten-specific
      induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not identified. Such findings might
      explain why patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity feel better on a
      gluten-free diet despite the continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by
      intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated 
      to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free
      diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains
      unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS
      have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a 
      response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been 
      postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This
      review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of
      different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper
      screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a vast neuroendocrine organ with extensive
      extrinsic and intrinsic neural circuits that interact to control its function.
      Circulating and paracrine hormones (amine and peptide) provide further control of
      secretory, absorptive, barrier, motor and sensory mechanisms that are essential
      to the digestion and assimilation of nutrients, and the transport and excretion
      of waste products. Specialized elements of the mucosa (including enteroendocrine 
      cells, enterocytes and immune cells) and the microbiome interact with other
      intraluminal contents derived from the diet, and with endogenous chemicals that
      alter the gut's functions. The totality of these control mechanisms is often
      summarized as the brain-gut axis. In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is the
      most common gastrointestinal disorder, there may be disturbances at one or more
      of these diverse control mechanisms. Patients present with abdominal pain in
      association with altered bowel function. This review documents advances in
      understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms in the brain-gut axis in patients
      with IBS. It is anticipated that identification of one or more disordered
      functions in clinical practice will usher in a renaissance in the management of
      IBS, leading to effective therapy tailored to the needs of the individual
      patient.

TI  - Gut microbiota influences low fermentable substrate diet efficacy in children
      with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 165-75

AB  - We sought to determine whether a low fermentable substrate diet (LFSD) decreases 
      abdominal pain frequency in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to
      identify potential microbial factors related to diet efficacy. Pain symptoms,
      stooling characteristics, breath hydrogen and methane, whole intestinal transit
      time, stool microbiome, and metabolite composition were collected and/or
      documented in eight children with IBS at baseline and during one week of an LFSD 
      intervention. Pain frequency (P<0.05), pain severity (P<0.05), and pain-related
      interference with activities (P<0.05) decreased in the subjects while on the
      LFSD. Responders vs. non-responders: four children (50%) were identified as
      responders (> 50% decrease in abdominal pain frequency while on the LFSD). There 
      were no differences between responders and non-responders with respect to
      hydrogen production, methane production, stooling characteristics, or gut transit
      time. Responders were characterized by increased pre-LFSD abundance of bacterial 
      taxa belonging to the genera Sporobacter (P<0.05) and Subdoligranulum (P<0.02)
      and decreased abundance of taxa belonging to Bacteroides (P<0.05) relative to
      non-responders. In parallel, stool metabolites differed between responders and
      non-responders and were associated with differences in microbiome composition.
      These pilot study results suggest that an LFSD may be effective in decreasing GI 
      symptoms in children with IBS. Microbial factors such as gut microbiome
      composition and stool metabolites while on the diet may relate to LFSD efficacy.

TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics and the gastrointestinal tract in health and disease.
PG  - 135-54
LID - 10.1007/s10787-014-0201-4 [doi]
AB  - The microbiome located in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) comprises the
      largest community (diverse and dense) of bacteria, and in conjunction with a
      conducive internal milieu, promotes the development of regulated pro- and
      anti-inflammatory signals within the GIT that promotes immunological and
      metabolic tolerance. In addition, host-microbial interactions govern GIT
      inflammation and provide cues for upholding metabolic regulation in both the host
      and microbes. Failure to regulate inflammatory responses can increase the risk of
      developing inflammatory conditions in the GIT. Here, we review clinical studies
      regarding the efficacy of probiotics/prebiotics and the role they may have in
      restoring host metabolic homeostasis by rescuing the inflammatory response. The
      clinical studies reviewed included functional constipation, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. We have demonstrated that there was an overall reduction in risk
      when probiotics were administered over placebo in the majority of GIT
      inflammatory conditions. The effect size of a cumulative reduction in relative
      risk for the GIT conditions/diseases investigated was 0.65 (0.61-0.70) (z =
      13.3); p < 0.0001 that is an average reduction in risk of 35 % in favour of
      probiotics. We also progress a hypothesis that the GIT comprises numerous
      micro-axes (e.g. mucus secretion, Th1/Th2 balance) that are in operational
      homeostasis; hence probiotics and prebiotics may have a significant
      pharmacobiotic regulatory role in maintaining host GIT homeostasis in disease
      states partially through reactive oxygen species signalling.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the society. Among the putative
      pathogeneses, gut dysmotility results in pain and disturbed defecation. The
      latter is probably caused by the effect of abnormal gut water secretion. The
      interaction between abnormal gas accumulation, abdominal pain and bloating
      remains controversial. Visceral hypersensitivity and its modification along with 
      the central transmission are the characteristics of IBS patients. The
      identification of biologic markers based on genetic polymorphisms is
      undetermined. Imbalanced gut microbiota may alter epithelial permeability to
      activate nociceptive sensory pathways which in turn lead to IBS. Certain food
      constituents may exacerbate bowel symptoms. The impact of adult and childhood
      abuses on IBS is underestimated. Using the concept of biopsychosocial dysfunction
      can integrate multidimensional pathogeneses. Antispasmodics plus stool
      consistency modifiers to treat the major symptoms and defecation are the
      first-line drug treatment. New drugs targeting receptors governing bowel
      motility, sensation and secretion can be considered, but clinicians must be aware
      of their potential serious side effects. Psychiatric drugs and modalities may be 
      the final options for treating intractable subjects. Probiotics of multi-species 
      preparations are safe and worth to be considered for the treatment. Antibiotics
      are promising but their long-term safety and effectiveness are unknown. Diet
      therapy including exclusion of certain food constituents is an economic measure. 
      Using relatively safe complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) may be
      optional to those patients who failed classical treatment. In conclusion, IBS is 
      a heterogeneous disorder with multidimensional pathogeneses. Personalized
      medicines with multidisciplinary approaches using different classes of drugs,
      psychiatric measures, probiotics and antibiotics, dietary therapy, and finally
      CAMs, can be considered.

PG  - 2456-69

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders, characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel
      habits. These symptoms cannot be explained by structural abnormalities and there 
      is no specific laboratory test or biomarker for IBS. Therefore, IBS is classified
      as a functional disorder with diagnosis dependent on the history taking about
      manifested symptoms and careful physical examination. Although a great deal of
      research has been carried out in this area, the pathophysiology of IBS is complex
      and not completely understood. Multiple factors are thought to contribute to the 
      symptoms in IBS patients; altered gastrointestinal motility, visceral
      hypersensitivity, and the brain-gut interaction are important classical concepts 
      in IBS pathophysiology. New areas of research in this arena include inflammation,
      postinfectious low-grade inflammation, genetic and immunologic factors, an
      altered microbiota, dietary factors, and enteroendocrine cells. These emerging
      studies have not shown consistent results, provoking controversy in the IBS
      field. However, certain lines of evidence suggest that these mechanisms are
      important at least a subset of IBS patients, confirming that IBS symptoms cannot 
      be explained by a single etiological mechanism. Therefore, it is important to
      keep in mind that IBS requires a more holistic approach to determining effective 
      treatment and understanding the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Care and feeding of the endocannabinoid system: a systematic review of potential 
      clinical interventions that upregulate the endocannabinoid system.
PG  - e89566
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0089566 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The "classic" endocannabinoid (eCB) system includes the cannabinoid
      receptors CB1 and CB2, the eCB ligands anandamide (AEA) and
      2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and their metabolic enzymes. An emerging
      literature documents the "eCB deficiency syndrome" as an etiology in migraine,
      fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, psychological disorders, and other
      conditions. We performed a systematic review of clinical interventions that
      enhance the eCB system--ways to upregulate cannabinoid receptors, increase ligand
      synthesis, or inhibit ligand degradation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
      searched PubMed for clinical trials, observational studies, and preclinical
      research. Data synthesis was qualitative. Exclusion criteria limited the results 
      to 184 in vitro studies, 102 in vivo animal studies, and 36 human studies.
      Evidence indicates that several classes of pharmaceuticals upregulate the eCB
      system, including analgesics (acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs, opioids, glucocorticoids), antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics,
      and anticonvulsants. Clinical interventions characterized as "complementary and
      alternative medicine" also upregulate the eCB system: massage and manipulation,
      acupuncture, dietary supplements, and herbal medicines. Lifestyle modification
      (diet, weight control, exercise, and the use of psychoactive substances--alcohol,
      tobacco, coffee, cannabis) also modulate the eCB system.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Few clinical trials have assessed interventions that
      upregulate the eCB system. Many preclinical studies point to other potential
      approaches; human trials are needed to explore these promising interventions.

AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional
      gastrointestinal disorder world wide that lasts for decades. The human gut
      harbors a diverse population of microbial organisms which is symbiotic and
      important for well being. However, studies on conventional, germ-free, and obese 
      animals have shown that alteration in normal commensal gut microbiota and an
      increase in pathogenic microbiota-termed "dysbiosis", impact gut function,
      homeostasis, and health. Diarrhea, constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, and
      abdominal pain arise in IBS from the gut-induced dysfunctional metabolic, immune,
      and neuro-immune communication. Dysbiosis in IBS is associated with gut
      inflammation. Gut-related inflammation is pivotal in promoting endotoxemia,
      systemic inflammation, and neuroinflammation. A significant proportion of IBS
      patients chronically consume alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and
      fatty diet; they may also suffer from co-morbid respiratory, neuromuscular,
      psychological, sleep, and neurological disorders. The above pathophysiological
      substrate is underpinned by dysbiosis, and dysfunctional bidirectional "Gut-Brain
      Axis" pathways. Pathogenic gut microbiota-related systemic inflammation (due to
      increased lipopolysaccharide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and barrier
      dysfunction), may trigger neuroinflammation enhancing dysfunctional brain regions
      including hippocampus and cerebellum. These as well as dysfunctional vago-vagal
      gut-brain axis may promote cognitive impairment. Indeed, inflammation is
      characteristic of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that manifest
      demntia. It is argued that an awareness of pathophysiological impact of IBS and
      implementation of appropriate therapeutic measures may prevent cognitive
      impairment and minimize vulnerability to dementia.

AB  - About two-thirds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients associate their
      symptoms with certain foods. We reviewed food-related factors putatively
      associated with manifestations of IBS. Soluble fiber may improve constipation but
      frequently increases bloating and abdominal pain. Carbohydrate malabsorption
      seems to be more frequent in IBS. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet significantly reduces IBS
      symptoms and has been suggested as a therapeutic option. Serological screening
      for celiac disease should be done in patients without constipation. Moreover,
      non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity, defined as gluten intolerance once celiac 
      disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out, should be considered in these
      patients. There is no specific diet for IBS patients but small and frequent
      meals, avoiding greasy foods, dairy products, many carbohydrates, caffeine and
      alcohol, is recommended.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder characterized by
      abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating. The pathophysiology of IBS is poorly
      understood, but the presence of psychosocial basis is now known. There is an
      increasing number of publications supporting the role of genetics in IBS. Most of
      the variations are found in genes associated with the brain-gut axis, revealing
      the strong correlation of brain-gut axis and IBS. miRNAs, which play critical
      roles in physiological processes, are not well studied in IBS. However, so far
      there is found an involvement of alterations in miRNA expression or sequence, in 
      IBS symptoms. IBS phenotype is affected by epigenetic alteration and environment.
      Changes in DNA and histone methylation are observed in patients who suffered
      childhood trauma or abuse, resulting in altered gene expression, such as the
      glucocorticoid receptor gene. Finally, diet is another factor associated with
      IBS, which may contribute to symptom onset. Certain foods may affect on bacterial
      metabolism and epigenetic modifications, predisposing to IBS.

TI  - Building additional complexity to in vitro-derived intestinal tissues.
PG  - S1

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders affect up to 25% of the US population. Common
      intestinal disorders include malabsorption, irritable bowel syndrome and fecal
      incontinence. Some GI disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease have a genetic
      basis and are associated with an absence or paucity of enteric nerves. Current
      treatment plans for GI disorders range from changes in diet to bowel resection,
      and there are very few drugs available that target the primary deficiencies in
      intestinal function such as controlled peristalsis. While animal models can
      recapitulate the broad range of intestinal pathologies of the GI tract, they are 
      intrinsically complicated and of low throughput. Several in vitro systems have
      been established, and these range from epithelial enteroids to more complex
      organoids, which contain most intestinal cell types. One of the more complex
      organoid systems was derived from adult mouse intestines and contains functional 
      enteric nerves and smooth muscle capable of peristalsis. Establishing an
      equivalent human intestinal system is challenging due to limited access and
      variable quality of human intestinal tissues. However, owing to recent advances, 
      it is possible to differentiate human induced and embryonic pluripotent stem
      cells, collectively called pluripotent stem cells, into human intestinal
      organoids (HIOs) in vitro. Although HIOs contain a significant degree of
      epithelial and mesenchymal complexity, they lack enteric nerves and thus are
      unable to model the peristaltic movements of the gut. The goal of this review is 
      to discuss approaches to generate complex in vitro systems that can be used to
      more comprehensively model common intestinal pathologies. New and more
      biologically complete human models of the intestine would allow for unprecedented
      studies of the cellular and molecular basis of normal and pathological gut
      function. Furthermore, fully functional HIOs could serve as a platform for
      preclinical drug studies to model absorption and efficacy.

      double-blinded randomised dietary intervention trial.
PG  - 1992-9
LID - 10.1017/S000711451400018X [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a replacement diet with
      organic, semi-whole-grain products derived from Triticum turgidum subsp.
      turanicum (ancient) wheat on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and
      inflammatory/biochemical parameters. A double-blinded randomised cross-over trial
      was performed using twenty participants (thirteen females and seven males, aged
      18-59 years) classified as having moderate IBS. Participants received products
      (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from ancient or modern wheat
      for 6 weeks in a random order. Symptoms due to IBS were evaluated using two
      questionnaires, which were compiled both at baseline and on a weekly basis during
      the intervention period. Blood analyses were carried out at the beginning and end
      of each respective intervention period. During the intervention period with
      ancient wheat products, patients experienced a significant decrease in the
      severity of IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P=
      0.004), satisfaction with stool consistency (P< 0.001) and tiredness (P< 0.0001).
      No significant difference was observed after the intervention period with modern 
      wheat products. Similarly, patients reported significant amelioration in the
      severity of gastrointestinal symptoms only after the ancient wheat intervention
      period, as measured by the intensity of pain (P= 0.001), the frequency of pain
      (P< 0.0001), bloating (P< 0.0001), abdominal distension (P< 0.001) and the
      quality of life (P< 0.0001). Interestingly, the inflammatory profile showed a
      significant reduction in the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
      including IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and
      vascular endothelial growth factor after the intervention period with ancient
      wheat products, but not after the control period. In conclusion, significant
      improvements in both IBS symptoms and the inflammatory profile were reported
      after the ingestion of ancient wheat products.

PG  - 321-34
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a highly prevalent condition responsible for almost
      one third of visits to the gastroenterologist and huge expenses for diagnosis,
      treatment and loss of working days. A unique pathophysiologic mechanism has not
      been elucidated yet and several possibilities have been proposed such as
      senso-perception and motor disturbances, the effect of stress and anxiety,
      serotonin receptor failures, activation of abnormal brain areas and pain
      modulation differences, among others. The absence of a biological marker has led 
      the investigators to consider this syndrome as an exclusion diagnostic condition,
      once the organic diseases have been discarded The changes in gut microbiota have 
      recently raised great interest among gastroenterologists. The study of the small 
      intestinal bowel overgrowth syndrome, the effect of antibiotics upon the flora,
      the recognition of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and the action of
      probiotics, together with the effect of malabsortion of diet carbohydrates have
      brought some new light in our knowledge. The present update will focus on the
      published evidence about the subject, bearing in mind that the mechanisms
      elicited here are only suitable for a subgroup of patients.

TI  - Smoking- and alcohol habits in relation to the clinical picture of women with
      microscopic colitis compared to controls.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1472-6874-14-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) induces gastrointestinal symptoms, which are
      partly overlapping with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), predominately in
      middle-aged and elderly women. The etiology is unknown, but association with
      smoking has been found. The aim of this study was to examine whether the
      increased risk for smokers to develop MC is a true association, or rather the
      result of confounding factors. Therefore, patients suffering from MC and
      population-based controls from the same geographic area were studied regarding
      smoking- and alcohol habits, and other simultaneous, lifestyle factors,
      concerning the clinical expression of the disease. METHODS: Women at the age of
      73 years or younger, who had been treated for biopsy-verified MC at any of the
      Departments of Gastroenterology in Skane, between 2002 and 2010, were invited to 
      the study (240 patients). Women (737) from the population-based prospective
      cohort study, Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), served as controls. A
      self-administered questionnaire about lifestyle factors, gastrointestinal
      symptoms, medical conditions and medication at the time for the study was sent by
      post. RESULTS: Altogether, 131 women with MC could be included after age-matching
      with controls (median age 56 years) and exclusion of secondary MC. Patients were 
      divided into persistent MC (MC1) and transient MC (MC2). Past smoking was
      associated with increased risk to develop MC2 (OR = 2.67, 95 CI = 1.15-6.23),
      whereas current smoking was associated with increased risk to develop MC1 (OR =
      3.18, 95 CI = 1.57-6.42). Concomitant symptoms of IBS were associated with
      smoking (OR = 4.24, 95 CI = 1.92-9.32). Alcohol drinking had no association with 
      MC or IBS. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that past smoking is associated with 
      transient MC, whereas current smoking is associated with persistent MC. Smoking
      is associated with MC patients with concomitant IBS-like symptoms.

TI  - Mechanisms and efficacy of dietary FODMAP restriction in IBS.
PG  - 256-66
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2013.259 [doi]
AB  - IBS is a debilitating condition that markedly affects quality of life. The
      chronic nature, high prevalence and associated comorbidities contribute to the
      considerable economic burden of IBS. The pathophysiology of IBS is not completely
      understood and evidence to guide management is variable. Interest in dietary
      intervention continues to grow rapidly. Ileostomy and MRI studies have
      demonstrated that some fermentable carbohydrates increase ileal luminal water
      content and breath hydrogen testing studies have demonstrated that some
      carbohydrates also increase colonic hydrogen production. The effects of
      fermentable carbohydrates on gastrointestinal symptoms have also been well
      described in blinded, controlled trials. Dietary restriction of fermentable
      carbohydrates (popularly termed the 'low FODMAP diet') has received considerable 
      attention. An emerging body of research now demonstrates the efficacy of
      fermentable carbohydrate restriction in IBS; however, limitations still exist
      with this approach owing to a limited number of randomized trials, in part due to
      the fundamental difficulty of placebo control in dietary trials. Evidence also
      indicates that the diet can influence the gut microbiota and nutrient intake.
      Fermentable carbohydrate restriction in people with IBS is promising, but the
      effects on gastrointestinal health require further investigation.

PG  - 74-86
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1361825 [doi]
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract inhabits a complex microbial ecosystem that
      plays a vital role in host health through its contributions to nutrient synthesis
      and digestion, protection from pathogens, and promoting maturation of host innate
      and adapt immune systems. The development of gut microbiota primarily occurs
      during infancy and is influenced by multiple factors, including prenatal
      exposure; gestational age; mode of delivery; feeding type; pre-, pro-, and
      antibiotic use; and host genetics. In genetically susceptible individuals,
      changes in the gut microbiota induced by environmental factors may contribute to 
      the development of immune-related disorders in childhood, including atopic
      diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Pre- and probiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment 
      of some immune-related diseases by modulating gut microbiota and regulating host 
      mucosal immune function. The review will discuss recent findings on the
      environmental factors that influence development of gut microbiota during infancy
      and its potential impact on some immune-related diseases in childhood. The use of
      pre- and probiotics for prevention and intervention of several important diseases
      in early life will also be reviewed.

TI  - A case-control study of current psychological well-being and weight-teasing
      history in young adults with and without bowel conditions.
PG  - 28-36
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being
      and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac
      disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from 
      those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years)
      completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed
      psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem,
      and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and
      weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition
      participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls =
      504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional
      logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics.
      RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall
      psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05)
      more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression,
      anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were
      also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P =
      0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing
      insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also
      more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 
      1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of
      their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study
      suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of 
      young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to
      develop skills and strategies for coping.

PG  - 13-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an algorithm for evaluation of the immune status in IBS
      patients with food intolerance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 42 patients with IBS were 
      observed. The diagnosis is based Rome III criteria. Determination of the
      concentration of serum allergen-IgG-antibodies to food allergens, IgG, IgA, IgM, 
      IgE and immunoregulatory substances IL-5, TGF beta1, IL-10, IL-4 IL-2, IL-13 were
      determined by enzyme immunoassay. All the patients received rotational diet
      therapy based on immunoassay data in addition to medical treatment of the basis
      disease. The control group comprised 15 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Food
      intolerances basically to foods proteinaceous was diagnosed in 25 patients with
      IBS (59.5% of cases). The effectiveness of diet therapy was 68% (17 patients).
      Analysis of clinical and laboratory data revealed that the implementation of food
      intolerance in patients with IBS reducing the levels of IL-10 and TGFbeta1. An
      effective rotational diet of food intolerance in IBS patients had significantly
      (p < 0.05) increase IgA levels. CONCLUSION: Food intolerance in IBS patients
      characterized an increased synthesis of allergen-specific IgG antibodies,
      insufficient production of anti-inflammatory immunoregulatory substances IL-10
      and TGFbeta1, and intact cytokines IL-2, - 4, - 5, - 13, IgG and IgM in serum.
      Efficiency rotary diet in patients with IBS is accompanied by positive clinical
      dynamics, increase levels of anti-inflammatory substances and serum IgA.

AB  - Celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the small intestine
      caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins in genetically
      predisposed individuals. Over the past several years, the concept of non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained significant interest from the scientific
      community and mass media and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free
      diet is rapidly growing. This condition is characterized by gastrointestinal or
      extraintestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence for
      underlying celiac disease or wheat allergy. Symptoms display significant overlap 
      with the irritable bowel syndrome. Many important factors regarding this
      relatively novel condition remain to be elucidated; no discriminative markers to 
      support a diagnosis of gluten sensitivity have been identified yet and its
      pathogenesis remains obscure. Here we review the current knowledge on NCGS, and
      outline potential pathogenic pathways of different gluten related disorders in
      order to gain clues about the pathophysiology of this novel condition.

TI  - Factors influencing the type, timing and severity of symptomatic responses to
      dietary gluten in patients with biopsy-proven coeliac disease.
PG  - 391-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: There is a paucity of data reflecting the symptomatic responses
      to dietary gluten (SRDG) in patients with Coeliac Disease (CD). We aimed to
      determine the type, timing and severity of SRDG with reference to a range of
      disease-related factors. METHODS: Postal survey of 224 biopsy-proven patients
      including gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence, symptom checklist, ROME II criteria
      and The Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale. Case-note review was also conducted.
      RESULTS: 26% of respondents were male. Full GFD adherence: n=159 (70%). Irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS): n=50 (22%). Anxiety: n=30 (13%); Depression: n=33 (14%);
      Anxiety & Depression: n=72 (32%). Pruritus, fatigue and bloating were a more
      common SRDG in the partial/none GFD adherent group (p=ns). Co-existing IBS was
      associated with a greater prevalence of nausea and fatigue in response to gluten 
      (p=<0.05). Fully GFD adherent patients are more likely to have SRDG <1hr than
      partial/none adherent (OR 4.8; p=0.004), as are a third of patients with
      co-existing IBS (OR 1.5; p=0.027) and those patients at risk of both anxiety and 
      depression (OR 1.9; p=0.04). Inadvertent exposure to dietary gluten in the fully 
      GFD adherent group is more likely to result in a severe SRDG in comparison to
      symptoms arising prior to consistent GFD adherence (OR 2.3; p=0.01). IBS
      sufferers are also more likely to rate their SRDG as severe in nature (OR 1.4;
      p=0.038). CONCLUSION: Patients with consistent GFD adherence experience a SRDG
      faster and more severe in comparison to prior gluten exposure possibly
      demonstrating an adept immunological response. Anxiety and depression also
      enhance the speed of symptom onset and co-existing visceral hypersensitivity is a
      risk factor for severe reactions to dietary gluten.

AB  - It is unknown whether children with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      identify specific foods that exacerbate their GI symptoms. The objectives of this
      study were to determine the perceived role of food on GI symptoms and to
      determine the impact of food-induced symptoms on quality of life (QOL) in
      children with functional GI disorders. Between August and November 2010, 25
      children ages 11 to 17 years old with functional GI disorders and a parent
      completed a food symptom association questionnaire and validated questionnaires
      assessing FGID symptoms and QOL. In addition, children completed a 24-hour food
      recall, participated in focus groups to identify problematic foods and any coping
      strategies, and discussed how their QOL was affected. Statistical analyses were
      conducted using chi2, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank, and
      Spearman's rho. Children identified a median of 11 (range=2 to 25) foods as
      exacerbating a GI symptom, with the most commonly identified foods being spicy
      foods, cow's milk, and pizza. Several coping strategies were identified,
      including consuming smaller portions, modifying foods, and avoiding a median of 8
      (range=1 to 20) foods. Children reported that food-induced symptoms interfered
      with school performance, sports, and social activities. Although the parent's
      assessment of their child's QOL negatively correlated with the number of
      perceived symptom-inducing foods in their child, this relationship was not found 
      in the children. Findings suggest that specific foods are perceived to exacerbate
      GI symptoms in children with functional GI disorders. In addition, despite use of
      several coping strategies, food-induced symptoms can adversely impact children's 
      QOL in several important areas.

TI  - Dietary fructose intolerance, fructan intolerance and FODMAPs.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1007/s11894-013-0370-0 [doi]
AB  - Dietary intolerances to fructose, fructans and FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) are common, yet
      poorly recognized and managed. Over the last decade, they have come to the
      forefront because of new knowledge on the mechanisms and treatment of these
      conditions. Patients with these problems often present with unexplained bloating,
      belching, distension, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Here, we have examined
      the most up-to-date research on these food-related intolerances, discussed
      controversies, and have provided some guidelines for the dietary management of
      these conditions. Breath testing for carbohydrate intolerance appears to be
      standardized and essential for the diagnosis and management of these conditions, 
      especially in the Western population. While current research shows that the
      FODMAP diet may be effective in treating some patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome, additional research is needed to identify more foods items that are
      high in FODMAPs, and to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dietary
      interventions.

LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0835 [doi]
LID - arztebl.2013.0835 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an inflammatory disease of, the small intestine
      with a prevalence of roughly 0.5%-1%. Its symptoms arise in response to gluten
      consumption by genetically predisposed persons (HLA-DQ2/8). The autoantigen
      tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
      celiac disease. METHOD: Selective review of pertinent literature, including
      guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Celiac disease can present at any
      age with gastrointestinal or extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., malabsorption 
      or Duhring's dermatitis herpetiformis); it can also be found in association with 
      other (auto-)immune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Most cases are
      oligosymptomatic. The wide differential diagnosis includes food intolerances,
      intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other conditions. The 
      definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of celiac disease-specific
      autoantibody to TG2 (endomysium), which is over 90% sensitive and far over 90%
      specific, and the characteristic histologic lesions of the small-bowel mucosa and
      remission on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: An understanding of celiac disease
      ought to inform everyday clinical practice in all medical disciplines, because
      this is a common condition with diverse manifestations that can be effectively
      diagnosed and easily treated for the prevention of both acute and long-term
      complications. Patients should follow a strictly gluten-free diet for life.

TI  - [Multidisciplinary guideline irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - A4584
AB  - The multidisciplinary guideline 'Diagnostics and treatment of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS)' provides the basis for a properly coordinated collaboration
      between the patient suffering from IBS and all healthcare providers involved in
      his or her treatment, such as the general practitioner, gastroenterologist,
      internist, occupational-health physician, dietitian and psychologist. The
      diagnosis 'IBS' is often made in accordance with diagnostic criteria, such as the
      Rome III criteria, but a somatic condition needs to be excluded first. If there
      are no indications for this, additional diagnostic tests are not necessary.
      Management of the condition consists primarily of advice on life-style plus
      non-pharmacological interventions, in addition to explaining the condition and
      providing information. Drug treatment is rarely indicated. If the IBS symptoms
      have a significant impact on quality of life and patients do not respond to the
      measures taken in accordance with this general policy, there are three options
      for psychotherapeutic treatment. When the symptoms result in absenteeism or other
      work-related problems, the doctor can advise the patient to contact the
      occupational-health physician and to search for specific solutions in
      consultation with the employer. When individual advice is required or if the
      patient's diet is not well-balanced, a referral to the dietitian will follow.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse food reactions (AFR) have has recently attracted increased
      attention from the media and are now more commonly reported by patients. Its
      classification, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment are complex and present a
      considerable challenge in clinical practice. Non-immune-mediated types of food
      intolerance have a cumulative prevalence of 30% to 40%, while true
      (immune-mediated) food allergies affect only 2% to 5% of the German population.
      METHOD: We selectively searched the literature for pertinent publications on
      carbohydrate malabsorption, with special attention to published guidelines and
      position papers. RESULTS: Carbohydrate intolerance can be the result of a rare,
      systemic metabolic defect (e.g., fructose intolerance, with a prevalence of 1 in 
      25,000 persons) or of gastrointestinal carbohydrate malabsorption. The
      malabsorption of simple carbohydrates is the most common type of
      non-immune-mediated food intolerance, affecting 20% to 30% of the European
      population. This condition is caused either by deficient digestion of lactose or 
      by malabsorption of fructose and/or sorbitol. Half of all cases of
      gastrointestinal carbohydrate intolerance have nonspecific manifestations, with a
      differential diagnosis including irritable bowel syndrome, intolerance reactions,
      chronic infections, bacterial overgrowth, drug side effects, and other diseases. 
      The diagnostic evaluation includes a nutritional history, an H2 breath test,
      ultrasonography, endoscopy, and stool culture. CONCLUSION: The goals of treatment
      for carbohydrate malabsorption are to eliminate the intake of the responsible
      carbohydrate substance or reduce it to a tolerable amount and to assure the
      physiological nutritional composition of the patient's diet. In parallel with
      these goals, the patient should receive extensive information about the
      condition, and any underlying disease should be adequately treated.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to update the reader on current developments
      in our understanding of how the gut microbiota impact on inflammatory bowel
      disease and the irritable bowel syndrome. It will also consider current efforts
      to modulate the microbiota for therapeutic effect. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene
      polymorphisms associated with inflammatory bowel disease increasingly suggest
      that interaction with the microbiota drives pathogenesis. This may be through
      modulation of the immune response, mucosal permeability or the products of
      microbial metabolism. Similar findings in irritable bowel syndrome have
      reinforced the role of gut-specific factors in this 'functional' disorder.
      Metagenomic analysis has identified alterations in pathways and interactions with
      the ecosystem of the microbiome that may not be recognized by taxonomic
      description alone, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism. Treatments targeted
      at the microbial stimulus with antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics have all
      progressed in the past year. Studies on the long-term effects of treatment on the
      microbiome suggest that dietary intervention may be needed for prolonged
      efficacy. SUMMARY: The microbiome represents 'the other genome', and to
      appreciate its role in health and disease will be as challenging as with our own 
      genome. Intestinal diseases occur at the front line of our interaction with the
      microbiome and their future treatment will be shaped as we unravel our
      relationship with it.

TI  - Remarkable prevalence of coeliac disease in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome plus fibromyalgia in comparison with those with isolated irritable bowel
      syndrome: a case-finding study.
PG  - R201
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) are 
      two common central sensitization disorders frequently associated in the same
      patient, and some of these patients with IBS plus FMS (IBS/FMS) could actually be
      undiagnosed of coeliac disease (CD). The present study was an active case finding
      for CD in two IBS cohorts, one constituted by IBS/FMS subjects and the other by
      people with isolated IBS. METHODS: A total of 104 patients (89.4% females)
      fulfilling the 1990 ACR criteria for FMS and the Rome III criteria for IBS
      classification and 125 unrelated age- and sex-matched IBS patients without FMS
      underwent the following studies: haematological, coagulation and biochemistry
      tests, serological and genetic markers for CD (i.e., tissue transglutaminase 2
      (tTG-2) and major histocompatibility complex HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8), multiple gastric
      and duodenal biopsies, FMS tender points (TPs), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
      (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
      (SF-36) and Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) for tiredness and gastrointestinal
      complaints. RESULTS: As a whole, IBS/FMS patients scored much worse in quality of
      life and VAS scores than those with isolated IBS (P < 0.001). Seven subjects
      (6.7%) from the IBS/FMS group displayed HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positivity, high tTG-2
      serum levels and duodenal villous atrophy, concordant with CD. Interestingly
      enough, these seven patients were started on a gluten-free diet (GFD), showing a 
      remarkable improvement in their digestive and systemic symptoms on follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this screening indicate that a non-negligible
      percentage of IBS/FMS patients are CD patients, whose symptoms can improve and in
      whom long-term CD-related complications might possibly be prevented with a strict
      lifelong GFD.

AB  - UNLABELLED: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate
      the quantity and quality of the current evidence regarding the effect of
      different probiotic strains in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGID) in children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are more
      effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related
      FGID, especially with respect to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. To date,
      however, probiotics have not proved effective for children with functional
      constipation.

TI  - The human microbiome and probiotics: implications for pediatrics.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1159/000354899 [doi]
AB  - Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human
      microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely
      contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial
      microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important
      considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future.
      Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing
      rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of
      the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear
      capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics
      may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome
      function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human
      health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the
      context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states
      include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis,
      acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it
      is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the 
      impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced
      understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate
      selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.

AB  - Various disease states are associated with an imbalance of protective and
      pathogenic bacteria in the gut, termed dysbiosis. Current evidence reveals that
      dietary factors affect the microbial ecosystem in the gut. Changes to community
      structure of the intestinal microbiota are not without consequence considering
      the wide effects that the microbes have on both local and systemic immunity. The 
      goal of this review is to give insight into the importance of gut microbiota in
      disease development and the possible therapeutic interventions in clinical
      settings. We introduce the complex tripartite relationship between diet, microbes
      and the gut epithelium. This is followed by a summary of clinical evidence of
      diet-induced dysbiosis as a contributing factor in the development of
      gastrointestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like obesity,
      diabetes, atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, the
      current dietary and microbial interventions to promote a healthy microbial
      profile will be reviewed.

TI  - Homeopathy for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - CD009710
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009710.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that
      leads to decreased health-related quality of life and work productivity.
      Evidence-based treatment guidelines have not been able to give guidance on the
      effects of homeopathic treatment for IBS because no systematic reviews have been 
      carried out to assess the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two
      types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review. In
      clinical homeopathy a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition.
      This differs from individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic
      remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed
      consultation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic
      treatment for treating IBS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing
      and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine
      Database (AMED), Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Register, Cochrane
      Complementary Medicine Field Specialised Register and the database of the
      Homeopathic Library (Hom-inform) from inception to February 2013. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies
      that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or
      usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.
      The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS. The overall quality of the
      evidence supporting this outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We
      calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
      continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. 
      MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs (213 participants) were included. No cohort or
      case-control studies were identified. Two studies published in 1976 and 1979
      compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy) to placebo for
      constipation-predominant IBS. One study published in 1990 compared individualised
      homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care (defined as high
      doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets asking 
      the patient to take a high fibre diet) for the treatment of IBS in female
      patients. Due to the low quality of reporting in the included studies the risk of
      bias in all three studies was unclear on most criteria and high for some
      criteria. A meta-analysis of two small studies (129 participants with
      constipation-predominant IBS) found a statistically significant difference in
      global improvement between the homeopathic remedy asafoetida and placebo at a
      short-term follow-up of two weeks. Seventy-three per cent of patients in the
      homeopathy group improved compared to 45% of placebo patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI
      1.18 to 2.18). There was no statistically significant difference in global
      improvement between the homeopathic remedies asafoetida plus nux vomica and
      placebo. Sixty-eight per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved
      compared to 52% of placebo patients (1 study, N = 42, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to
      2.15). GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcome
      global improvement as very low due to high or unknown risk of bias, short-term
      follow-up and sparse data. There was no statistically significant difference
      found between individualised homeopathic treatment and usual care (1 RCT, N = 20)
      for the outcome "feeling unwell", where the participant scored how "unwell" they 
      felt before, and after treatment (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22). None of the
      included studies reported on adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A pooled
      analysis of two small studies suggests a possible benefit for clinical
      homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with
      constipation-predominant IBS. These results should be interpreted with caution
      due to the low quality of reporting in these trials, high or unknown risk of
      bias, short-term follow-up, and sparse data. One small study found no
      statistically difference between individualised homeopathy and usual care
      (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and
      diet sheets advising a high fibre diet). No conclusions can be drawn from this
      study due to the low number of participants and the high risk of bias in this
      trial. In addition, it is likely that usual care has changed since this trial was
      conducted. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess
      the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to
      placebo or usual care.

PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1097/01.meg.0000435546.87251.f7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that gluten sensitivity (GS) exists in the absence of
      coeliac disease (CD). This clinical entity has been termed noncoeliac gluten
      sensitivity (NCGS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the population prevalence of
      self-reported GS and referral characteristics to secondary care. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A UK population-based questionnaire screened for GS and related
      symptoms. Diagnostic outcomes were also analyzed in patients referred to
      secondary care with GS. CD diagnosis entailed a positive coeliac serology
      (endomysial and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies) plus Marsh 1-3 on duodenal
      biopsies. NCGS diagnosis was based on exclusion of CD. Clinical comparisons were 
      made between NCGS and CD. RESULTS: A total of 1002 adults in the population
      (female 55%, mean age 39 years). The self-reported prevalence for GS was 13%
      (female 79%, mean age 39.5 years, P<0.0001), with 3.7% consuming a gluten-free
      diet and 0.8% known to have a doctor diagnosis of CD. Individuals with GS had an 
      increased prevalence of fulfilling the Rome III criteria for irritable bowel
      syndrome, in comparison with those without GS (20 vs. 3.89%, odds ratio 6.23,
      P<0.0001).In secondary care 200 GS patients (female 84%, mean age 39.6 years)
      were investigated, in whom 7% were found to have CD and 93% to have NCGS. All CD 
      patients were human leucocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 positive compared with 53% of
      NCGS cases (P=0.0003). Nutritional deficiencies (P</=0.003), autoimmune disorders
      (23.1 vs. 9.7%, P=0.0001) and a lower mean BMI (23.7 vs. 25.8, P=0.001) were
      significantly associated with CD compared with NCGS. CONCLUSION: GS is commonly
      self-reported with symptoms suggesting an association with irritable bowel
      syndrome. The majority of patients have NCGS, an entity which demonstrates
      clinical and immunologic difference to CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by the
      presence of gastrointestinal and multisystem symptoms, which occasionally mimic
      those of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). To
      assess the effectiveness of a Gluten-Free Diet (GFD) in seven adult female
      screening-detected CD subjects, categorized as severe IBS and FMS patients.
      METHODS: All subjects showed villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies, were
      HLA-DQ2/DQ8-positive, and fulfilled the Rome III and ACR 1990 criteria
      respectively for IBS and FMS classification. GFD effectiveness was assessed at
      baseline and after 1 year, examining the score changes in the Tender Points (TPs)
      test, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire
      (HAQ), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for
      gastrointestinal complaints, pain and tiredness, drug prescriptions and
      tissue-Trans-Glutaminase (tTG) serum levels. RESULTS: At baseline, all patients
      had poor Quality of Life and VAS scores, a high number of TPs and drug
      prescriptions, and increased tTG levels. After 1 year of GFD, all outcome
      measures significantly improved, with a decrease of 51-60% in TPs, FIQ, HAQ, and 
      VAS scales, and in the number of prescribed drugs, accompanied by an increase of 
      48-60% in SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, and a decrease of
      tTG to normal values. CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot study show that the
      adherence to a GFD by CD-related IBS/FMS patients can simultaneously improve CD
      and IBS/FMS symptoms, and indicate the merit of further research on a larger
      cohort.

AB  - This article discusses the most interesting studies on functional and motility
      gastrointestinal disorders presented in Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) in 2013.
      New data were reported on the clinical importance of functional gastrointestinal 
      disorders (FGID) and on how they can produce numerous disturbances such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. These disturbances are associated with somatic
      functional disease and particularly with fatigue. In addition, new data have
      emerged on the physiopathology of these disorders, with some studies reporting
      that environmental factors and events in early infancy can favor their
      development. Data were also presented on how bile acids can increase
      susceptibility to diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and on
      how the type of food intake can favor the development of symptoms. More data are 
      available on the presence of underlying celiac disease in patients with IBS,
      which should prompt us to investigate this disease in our patients. Likewise,
      indiscriminate application of a gluten-free diet in patients with IBS has been
      shown not to produce a clear improvement. Regarding the physiopathology of
      functional dyspepsia (FD), results have been presented on how psychological
      factors can modify gastric accommodation and how this is in turn related to
      visceral hypersensitivity and gastric emptying. Regarding therapy, mirtazapine
      can improve symptoms and lead to weight gain in patients with severe FD and
      substantial weight loss. Results were presented on new drugs for IBS such as
      ibodutant and on old drugs with new applications such as mesalazine and ebastine.
      The antinociceptive effect of linaclotide is now better understood and a
      meta-analysis has shown its effectiveness in IBS with constipation as the main
      symptom. In patients with constipation, pelvic floor dysynergy can be diagnosed
      by a simple clinical interview and rectal touch. More data are available on the
      efficacy of prucalopride (which has been shown to accelerate colon transit time) 
      and data were provided on plecanatide, a potential new drug that could be useful 
      in constipation. Finally, results were presented on the use of botulinum toxin
      injection in patients with spastic motility disorders of the esophagus. Also
      worthy of mention is a study confirming a higher frequency of esophageal cancer
      patients with achalasia who receive treatment.

TI  - Non-celiac wheat sensitivity as an allergic condition: personal experience and
      narrative review.
PG  - 1845-52; quiz 1853
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.353 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a newly described clinical
      entity characterized by symptoms, which can involve the gastrointestinal tract,
      the nervous system, the skin, and other organs. There is little data on the
      pathogenesis of NCWS and it is probable that different pathogenic mechanisms are 
      involved in the different clinical manifestations of the disease. The only common
      denominator of NCWS "syndrome" is wheat consumption: the symptoms disappear on
      exclusion of wheat from the diet, and reappear on wheat consumption. The
      objective of this study was to review our prior data regarding NCWS and to review
      relevant medical literature regarding NCWS, with particular attention to the
      hypothesis that NCWS patients could suffer from non-immunoglobulin E
      (IgE)-mediated wheat allergy. METHODS: We reviewed our data on 276 patients
      diagnosed with NCWS by means of double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat
      challenge. The data indicating a possible wheat allergy diagnosis were examined
      and other data in the literature were reviewed; we review the role of serum
      immunoglobulin G antibodies and the basophil activation assay in food allergy,
      and the histology findings in the food allergy diagnosis. RESULTS: The comparison
      between patients suffering from NCWS and presenting with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) and controls with IBS not due to NCWS showed that NCWS was characterized
      by: a personal history of food allergy in the pediatric age (0.01), coexistent
      atopic diseases (0.0001), positive serum anti-gliadin (0.0001) and
      anti-betalactoglobulin (0.001) antibodies, positive cytofluorimetric assay
      revealing in vitro basophil activation by food antigens (0.0001), and a presence 
      of eosinophils in the intestinal mucosa biopsies (0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients 
      with NCWS and multiple food sensitivity show several clinical, laboratory, and
      histological characteristics that suggest they might be suffering from
      non-IgE-mediated food allergy. However, other pathogenic mechanisms need to be
      considered.

TI  - Impact of eating restriction on gastrointestinal motility in adolescents with
      IBS.
PG  - 491-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000228 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal disturbances as a result of changes in eating
      patterns have been described in eating disorders. Many patients who experience
      irritable bowel syndrome report changes in eating patterns as a way to cope with 
      their symptoms. Little is known about the consequences of these practices. The
      aim of this study was to explore whether repeated eating restriction (defined as 
      not eating >/= 4 hours while hungry) is associated with motility disturbances.
      METHODS: Of 17 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, subjects were divided into
      those who habitually restrict their eating (n = 8) and those without eating
      restriction (n = 9) (age range 15-21, mean 19.2; 64.7% girls). Whole-gut transit 
      time was measured by radiopaque markers, gastric sensitivity was measured by
      water load test (drinking max of 800 mL of water in 5 minutes or until full), and
      gastric dysrhythmias by an electrogastrogram. RESULTS: Restrictors drank less
      water (mean 464.4 mL) than nonrestrictors (mean 613 mL; P = 0.02). No difference 
      was found in gastric dysrhythmias (62.5% vs 77.8%; P = 0.5). Whole-gut transit
      tended to be slower in the restrictors (mean 51.0 hours) than in nonrestrictors
      (mean 37.5 hours), but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Eating restriction 
      appears to be associated with increased gastric sensation. More data are needed
      from larger studies to determine whether eating behaviors are associated with
      other motility disturbances.

TI  - Adipokine profile in celiac patients: differences in comparison with patients
      suffering from diarrhea-predominant IBS and healthy subjects.
PG  - 1377-85
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.845907 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The role of adipokines such as resistin, leptin, and adiponectin could
      be pivotal in the molecular crosstalk between the inflamed intestine and the
      surrounding mesenteric adipose tissue. Our aims were to a) evaluate their
      circulating concentrations in patients with active celiac disease (ACD) and
      compare them to those in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS-d) and healthy subjects; b) establish the impact of genetic
      variability in resistin; and c) evaluate whether a 1-year gluten-free diet (GFD) 
      modifies circulating concentrations of resistin, leptin, and adiponectin in
      celiac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The study included 34 ACD patients, 29
      IBS-d patients, and 27 healthy controls. Circulating concentrations of resistin, 
      leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and IL-8 were evaluated at the time of enrollment.
      Resistin +299 G/A polymorphism was also analysed. In CD patients, biochemical
      measurements were repeated after a 1-year GFD. RESULTS. Along with higher IL-6
      and IL-8 plasma levels, higher resistin and adiponectin concentrations were found
      in ACD and IBS-d patients compared with controls (p: 0.0351 and p: 0.0020,
      respectively). Resistin values proved to be predictable from a linear combination
      of IL-8 and +299 polymorphism. GFD affected resistin (p: 0.0009), but not leptin 
      and adiponectin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that these
      adipokines are involved in modulating inflammatory processes in both CD and IBS-d
      patients. Alterations in the adipokine profile as well as the higher prevalence
      of the resistin +299 G/A SNP A allele compared to controls support the hypothesis
      that, at least in well-defined cases of IBS, a genetic component may also be
      supposed.

TI  - Consumption of spicy foods and the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 6465-71
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i38.6465 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the association between consumption of spicy foods and prevalence
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, data from 4763 Iranian adult participants were used.
      Consumption of spicy foods was estimated using a dietary habits questionnaire
      that included a question on spicy foods consumption: "how frequently do you use
      spicy foods (pepper, curry, ginger, cinnamon and turmeric) during a week?"
      Participants could respond to the question by choosing one of these choices:
      never, 1-3 times, 4-6 times, 7-9 times, or more than 10 times per week. A
      modified Persian version of the Rome III questionnaire was used to determine the 
      prevalence of IBS. RESULTS: IBS was prevalent in 21.7% (18.6% of men and 24.1% of
      women) of the study population. After controlling for potential confounders
      including dietary behaviors, those consuming spicy foods >/= 10 times per week
      were 92% more likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy
      foods (OR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.23-3.01, P trend < 0.01). The association remained
      significant even after taking lactose intolerance into account (OR = 1.85; 95%CI:
      1.18-2.90, P trend < 0.01). Stratified analysis by gender revealed that the
      association between consumption of spicy foods and IBS was not significant in
      men; however, a significant association was found among women after taking
      potential cofounders, including meal regularity and lactose intolerance, into
      account. Women who consumed spicy foods >/= 10 times per week were two times more
      likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy foods (OR = 2.03;
      95%CI: 1.09-3.77, P trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Consumption of spicy foods is
      directly associated with IBS, particularly in women. Further, prospective studies
      are warranted to (1) examine this association in other populations; and (2)
      evaluate whether dietary interventions, for example a reduction in spice
      consumption, would improve IBS symptoms.

TI  - Low-carbohydrate and high-fat intake can manage obesity and associated
      conditions: occasional survey.
PG  - 826-30
LID - 10.7196/samj.7302 [doi]
AB  - This study analyses 127 communications from individuals self-reporting their
      weight change following adoption of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) eating
      plan. Total combined self-reported weight loss was 1 900 kg (range 5 kg gain to
      84 kg loss). The mean +/- standard deviation weight loss of 15 (+/-12) kg is
      among the largest yet described. Sixteen subjects reported the LCHF 'cured' (i.e.
      medications no longer required) one or more of their medical conditions, most
      commonly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n=14), hypertension (n=8) and
      hypercholesterolaemia (n=7). Another 9 subjects with either type 1 diabetes
      mellitus or T2DM reduced medications as did 7 patients with hypertension; 8 no
      longer suffered from irritable bowel syndrome. These data show that significant
      and rapid weight loss is possible on an unsupervised eating plan that severely
      restricts daily carbohydrate intake to approximately &lt;75 g/day. Better weight 
      loss on a carbohydrate-restricted LCHF eating plan than on an iso-caloric
      high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet is well described in the literature,
      probably due to a paradoxical reduction of hunger by carbohydrate restriction. A 
      randomised controlled clinical trial is urgently required to disprove the
      hypothesis that the LCHF eating plan can reverse cases of T2DM, metabolic
      syndrome and hypertension without pharmacotherapy.

      abnormalities in IBS.
PG  - 1441-9

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rectal sensory and motor interactions in patients with IBS
      have not been studied in detail. The aim of this study was to evaluate fasting
      and postprandial rectal sensorimotor characteristics and their interactions in
      IBS compared with healthy controls. DESIGN: We included 274 patients with IBS and
      34 controls. All subjects underwent a rectal barostat study before and 60 min
      after a standardised liquid meal (800 kcal; 60% fat). Sensory thresholds,
      intensity of sensations, viscerosomatic referral and compliance were measured.
      During 15 min before the first distension sequence and until 50 min after meal
      intake, rectal balloon volumes were registered in 5 min intervals at operating
      pressure to quantify rectal tone. Mixed models were used to analyse the rectal
      tone response over time. RESULTS: Rectal sensory thresholds and compliance were
      decreased and viscerosomatic referral areas increased in patients with IBS
      compared with controls. Meal intake increased rectal sensitivity, compliance and 
      referral areas in patients and controls and the same proportions of patients were
      hypersensitive to distension before and after meal intake. There was a higher
      basal rectal tone in IBS and a significantly different rectal tone response after
      meal intake in patients with IBS compared with controls and, interestingly, also 
      in IBS with rectal hypersensitivity (defined in the preprandial state), compared 
      with normosensitive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Meal intake affects rectal
      sensorimotor function in IBS and health. Importantly, the rectal tone responses
      to a high-caloric meal are different between patients with IBS and controls, as
      well as between hypersensitive and normosensitive patients with IBS.

TI  - Functional bowel symptoms and diet.
PG  - 1067-74
LID - 10.1111/imj.12266 [doi]
AB  - It is well recognised that ingestion of food is a trigger for functional bowel
      symptoms, particularly those associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Patients often use manipulation of diet as a means of controlling symptoms.
      Despite description of multiple dietary methods, few have scientific backing or
      quality evidence of efficacy. One approach is to define how specific food
      components influence the pathophysiology of IBS and then rationally design
      dietary approaches. For example, short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP)) cause luminal
      distension, which is a major stimulus for the development of symptoms in patients
      with visceral hypersensitivity. By determining food content of FODMAP, a diet in 
      which foods low in FODMAP are favoured over those high in FODMAP can be designed.
      Observational, comparative and randomised controlled treatment and rechallenge
      studies have shown that such an approach is efficacious in the majority of
      patients with IBS. The low FODMAP diet is now the primary dietary therapy for
      such patients. Similar approaches can be applied to other food components,
      including proteins (such as gluten), fats and natural bioactive food chemicals.
      Such approaches have suggestions of efficacy, but the evidence base remains
      underdeveloped. An additional and important consideration for any dietary therapy
      is its nutritional adequacy and potential adverse health effects. Dietary
      manipulation is now a key management strategy in patients with functional bowel
      symptoms. Future well-designed interventional studies will lead to refinement of 
      dietary approaches taken and to a better understanding of their long-term safety.

TI  - Taste receptors of the gut: emerging roles in health and disease.
PG  - 179-90
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305112 [doi]
AB  - Recent progress in unravelling the nutrient-sensing mechanisms in the taste buds 
      of the tongue has triggered studies on the existence and role of chemosensory
      cells in the gut. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the key interface between
      food and the human body and can sense basic tastes in much the same way as the
      tongue, through the use of similar G-protein-coupled taste receptors. These
      receptors 'taste' the luminal content and transmit signals that regulate nutrient
      transporter expression and nutrient uptake, and also the release of gut hormones 
      and neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of energy and glucose
      homeostasis. Hence, they play a prominent role in the communication between the
      lumen, epithelium, smooth muscle cells, afferent nerve fibres and the brain to
      trigger adaptive responses that affect gastrointestinal function, food intake and
      glucose metabolism. This review summarises how sensing of nutrients by taste
      receptors along the gut plays a key role in the process of digestion, and how
      disturbances or adaptations of these chemosensory signalling pathways may
      contribute to the induction or resolution of a number of pathological conditions 
      related to diabetes, obesity, or diet-induced symptom generation in irritable
      bowel syndrome. Targeting these receptors may represent a promising novel route
      for the treatment of a number of these diseases.

TI  - Fasting and postprandial volumes of the undisturbed colon: normal values and
      changes in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome measured using serial
      MRI.
PG  - 124-30
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12243 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous assessments of colon morphology have relied on tests which
      were either invasive or used ionizing radiation. We aimed to measure regional
      volumes of the undisturbed colon in healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). METHODS: 3D regional
      (ascending, transverse, and descending) colon volumes were measured in fasting
      abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) images of 75 HVs and 25 IBS-D patients.
      Thirty-five of the HV and all 25 IBS-D subjects were fed a standard meal and
      postprandial MRI data obtained over 225 min. KEY RESULTS: Colonic regions were
      identified and 3D maps from cecum to sigmoid flexure were defined. Fasted
      regional volumes showed wide variation in both HVs being (mean +/- SD) ascending 
      colon (AC) 203 +/- 75 mL, transverse (TC) 198 +/- 79 mL, and descending (DC) 160 
      +/- 86 mL with no difference from IBS-D subjects (AC 205 +/- 69 mL, TC 232 +/-
      100 mL, and DC 151 +/- 71 mL, respectively). The AC volume expanded by 10% after 
      feeding (p = 0.007) in the 35 HV possibly due to increased ileo-colonic inflow. A
      later rise in AC volume occurred from t = 90 to t = 240 min as the meal residue
      entered the cecum. In contrast, IBS-D subjects showed a much reduced postprandial
      response of the AC (p < 0.0001) and a greater increase in TC volume after 90 min 
      (p = 0.0244) compared to HV. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: We have defined a normal
      range of the regional volumes of the undisturbed colon in fasted and fed states. 
      The AC in IBS-D appeared less able to accommodate postprandial inflow which may
      account for faster colonic transit.

TI  - Common gastrointestinal symptoms: irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 16-23
AB  - The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be considered when
      patients have had abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and change in bowel habits
      for 6 months. Patients may experience variation between periods of constipation
      and diarrhea. When evaluating patients with IBS, physicians should be alert for
      red flag symptoms, such as rectal bleeding, anemia, nighttime pain, and weight
      loss. Physicians also should consider other medical conditions that manifest
      similarly to IBS. Clinicians who are confident in diagnosing IBS based on
      symptoms typically do not obtain many tests unless the patient has red flag
      symptoms. Various etiologic mechanisms have been proposed for IBS, including
      abnormal bowel motility, inflammation, altered mucosal permeability, genetic
      predisposition, and visceral hypersensitivity. Lack of certainty about the
      etiology makes it difficult to develop effective management approaches; thus,
      management is directed toward symptom relief. Dietary changes, such as avoiding
      fermentable carbohydrates, may benefit some patients, especially those with
      bloating. Constipation-dominant IBS can be managed with antispasmodics,
      lubiprostone, or linaclotide, whereas diarrhea-dominant IBS can be managed with
      loperamide or alosetron, though the latter drug can cause ischemic colitis. For
      long-term therapy, tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors have good efficacy. Peppermint oil and probiotics also may provide
      benefit.

TI  - Non-Celiac Gluten sensitivity: the new frontier of gluten related disorders.
PG  - 3839-53
LID - 10.3390/nu5103839 [doi]
AB  - Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and
      recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and
      extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in 
      subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy
      (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been
      generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical
      studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human
      disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been 
      detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies
      suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders,
      particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children
      have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical
      studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related
      disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat
      amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain
      carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS)
      experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and
      current trends on NCGS.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) often is used to manage functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet
      there is limited evidence of its efficacy, compared with a normal Western diet.
      We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian 
      diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients
      with IBS. METHODS: In a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals
      (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from
      subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups 
      that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian
      diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to
      the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual
      analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet
      periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the
      low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for
      frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating. RESULTS:
      Subjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95%
      confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with 
      the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and
      the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were
      reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and
      unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater
      satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but
      diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and
      King's Stool Chart scores. CONCLUSIONS: In a controlled, cross-over study of
      patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a
      first-line therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: ACTRN12612001185853.

AB  - At best, currently available therapies provide symptomatic relief from functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). No existing therapy, however, can influence the
      natural course of any of these disorders, prompting interest in new and safe
      treatment options. This paper summarizes the clinical evidence from randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses of the effectiveness of
      probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary fiber in the treatment of FGD in the
      pediatric population. While it is too soon to recommend the routine use of any
      probiotics for treating FGD, some of these therapeutic options can provide a
      health benefit to patients, and therefore can be discussed with patients and/or
      caregivers. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has consistently improved symptoms of
      infantile colic. The use of Lactobacillus GG moderately increased treatment
      success in children with abdominal pain-related FGD, particularly among children 
      with irritable bowel syndrome. Also, data from one trial suggest that VSL#3 seems
      to be effective in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life of
      children affected by irritable bowel syndrome. L. reuteri DSM 17938 may help
      infants with constipation. Limited evidence suggests that administration of a
      fiber supplement is more effective than placebo for the treatment of childhood
      constipation.

AB  - For many years irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and celiac disease (CD) have been
      considered 2 completely separate entities, with CD being clearly related to a
      permanent gluten intolerance and IBS having no relation with gluten ingestion.
      However IBS and CD symptoms may be indistinguishable, especially when diarrhea,
      bloating or abdominal pain predominate. In the last decade several studies have
      shown that the separation between CD and IBS is not so clear. Thus, some patients
      who have been diagnosed of IBS suffer in fact from CD. In addition, it seems that
      there is a group of patients who, without having CD, suffer gluten intolerance
      that cause them digestive symptoms similar to those of IBS. Gluten sensitivity is
      defined as the spectrum of morphological, immunological and functional
      abnormalities that respond to a gluten-free diet. This concept includes
      histological, immunological and clinical manifestations in the absence of evident
      morphological abnormalities. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish in a
      scientific way in which patients a gluten-free diet will be beneficial as well as
      when this is not justified.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the entity of Non-Celiac Gluten
      Sensitivity (NCGS) in recent years; however, it still remains a controversial
      topic and its pathogenesis is not well understood. Celiac Disease, in contrast,
      is a well-studied condition that has become increasingly recognized as a
      prevalent condition arising from a heightened immunological response to gluten.
      Wheat allergy is an IgE-mediated condition capable of causing a variety of
      gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the number of patients who have neither
      celiac disease nor wheat allergy, but appear to derive benefit from a gluten-free
      diet, is also increasing substantially. The use of the term NCGS as a way of
      describing this condition has become increasingly prevalent in recent years.
      PURPOSE: In this review, we will focus on gastrointestinal manifestations of NCGS
      and discuss the evidence for the condition and its putative pathogenesis. We will
      discuss areas of controversy and areas for potential future research.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, diet and health.
PG  - 387-402
LID - 10.1017/S0007114513002560 [doi]
AB  - The human intestine is colonised by 10(1)(3) to 10(1)(4) micro-organisms, the
      vast majority of which belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Although
      highly stable over time, the composition and activities of the microbiota may be 
      influenced by a number of factors including age, diet and antibiotic treatment.
      Although perturbations in the composition or functions of the microbiota are
      linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome and obesity), it is unclear at this point whether these 
      changes are a symptom of the disease or a contributing factor. A better knowledge
      of the mechanisms through which changes in microbiota composition (dysbiosis)
      promote disease states is needed to improve our understanding of the causal
      relationship between the gut microbiota and disease. While evidence of the
      preventive and therapeutic effects of probiotic strains on diarrhoeal illness and
      other intestinal conditions is promising, the exact mechanisms of the beneficial 
      effects are not fully understood. Recent studies have raised the question of
      whether non-viable probiotic strains can confer health benefits on the host by
      influencing the immune system. As the potential health effect of these non-viable
      bacteria depends on whether the mechanism of this effect is dependent on
      viability, future research needs to consider each probiotic strain on a
      case-by-case basis. The present review provides a comprehensive, updated overview
      of the human gut microbiota, the factors influencing its composition and the role
      of probiotics as a therapeutic modality in the treatment and prevention of
      diseases and/or restoration of human health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorbitol and mannitol are naturally-occurring polyol isomers.
      Although poor absorption and induction of gastrointestinal symptoms by sorbitol
      are known, the properties of mannitol are poorly described. We aimed to expand
      data on food composition of these polyols, and to compare their absorptive
      capacities and symptom induction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
      and healthy individuals. METHODS: Food samples were analysed for sorbitol and
      mannitol content. The degree of absorption measured by breath hydrogen production
      and gastrointestinal symptoms (visual analogue scales) was evaluated in a
      randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 21 healthy and 20 IBS
      subjects after challenges with 10 g of sorbitol, mannitol or glucose. RESULTS:
      Certain fruits and sugar-free gum contained sorbitol, whereas mannitol content
      was higher in certain vegetables. Similar proportions of patients with IBS (40%) 
      and healthy subjects (33%) completely absorbed sorbitol, although more so with
      IBS absorbed mannitol (80% versus 43%; P = 0.02). Breath hydrogen production was 
      similar in both groups after lactulose but was reduced in patients with IBS after
      both polyols. No difference in mean (SEM) hydrogen production was found in
      healthy controls after sorbitol [area-under-the-curve: 2766 (591) ppm 4 h(-1) ]
      or mannitol [2062 (468) ppm 4 h(-1) ] but, in patients with IBS, this was greater
      after sorbitol [1136 (204) ppm 4 h(-1) ] than mannitol [404 (154) ppm 4 h(-1) ; P
      = 0.002]. Overall gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly after both
      polyols in patients with IBS only, although they were independent of
      malabsorption of either of the polyols. CONCLUSIONS: Increased and discordant
      absorption of mannitol and sorbitol occurs in patients with IBS compared to that 
      in healthy controls. Polyols induced gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with
      IBS independently of their absorptive patterns, suggesting that the dietary
      restriction of polyols may be efficacious.

LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e31829ed911 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this literature review is to develop a thorough understanding of
      the research on food intolerance and its relationship to irritable bowel
      syndrome. Knowledge of the connection between the two conditions will assist
      allied healthcare professionals in working with patients to better manage their
      symptoms. Reduced healthcare costs may also result if patients are able to
      identify problematic foods and experience symptom improvement with diet changes. 
      The review consists of an overview of food intolerance including prevalence,
      specific foods implicated including an in-depth review of research on bulk
      sweeteners, as well as methods of diagnosis. In addition, prevalence, specific
      foods associated with food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome patients such 
      as carbohydrates and lipids, nutritional consequences of food intolerance, and
      possible food-related methods of treatment including increased fiber intake are
      discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research and possible directions
      allied healthcare professionals can start with in assisting patients are
      provided.

LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.812139 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To perform a validation of dairy registrations for use as diagnostic 
      tool in IBS and fructose malabsorption (FM). To investigate the precision of the 
      fructose breath test (FBT) as compared with symptom score reduction on
      fructose-reduced diet (FRD) in a cohort of patients with Rome II defined
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). DESIGN: IBS patients diagnosed according to the
      Rome II criteria and with no organic gastrointestinal disease were enrolled. The 
      patients were randomized in an open study design with a 2 week run-in on IBS
      diet, followed by 4 weeks w/wo additional FRD. FBT was performed in all patients.
      Dairy registrations of stool frequency and consistency as well as abdominal
      pain/discomfort and bloating on a visual analog scale (VAS) were performed during
      the whole study. RESULTS: A total of 182 subjects performed the study according
      to protocol (88 FRD, 94 controls). The VAS symptom registration performed well in
      validation procedures, whereas stool data showed less impressive characteristics.
      FRD improved symptom scores (abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating)
      significantly whereas no changes were observed in the control group. The effect
      of FRD on the stool frequency was modest but no effect was observed on the stool 
      consistency. The FBT did not discriminate between patients with and without
      effect of FRD, and even in the group with a negative FBT significant improvement 
      of symptom scores was observed. CONCLUSION: VAS measures yield reliable symptom
      evaluation in dairy registrations of IBS. FRD improves symptom scores in IBS
      patients independent of results from the FBT.

AB  - Diet is important in triggering the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      This study investigated the impact of dietary guidance on the symptoms, quality
      of life and habitual diet of patients with IBS. Forty-six patients who fulfilled 
      the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS were included. Of these patients, 
      17 completed the entire study. Each patient attended three sessions (~45 min in
      duration) and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The
      patients were asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to receiving
      the dietary guidance, and at least 3 months subsequently: The Birmingham IBS
      symptom score questionnaire, the IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire, the
      Short-Form Nepean and Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI) and the MoBa Food Frequency
      Questionnaire (MoBa FFQ). The time at which patients completed the questionnaires
      following dietary guidance ranged from 3-9 months (median, 4 months). The total
      IBS symptom scores were reduced once the patients had received dietary guidance
      (P=0.001). The total score for the quality of life, as assessed by the IBSQOL and
      the SF-NDI, increased significantly following the dietary guidance sessions
      (P=0.003 and P=0.002, respectively). There were no statistical differences in the
      intake of calories, carbohydrate, fiber, protein, fat or alcohol in the patients 
      with IBS following dietary guidance. There were increases in the consumption of
      dairy products, beta-carotene, retinol equivalents, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and
      calcium, although only the increase in vitamin B12 consumption was statistically 
      significant. There was a significant reduction in the consumption of certain
      fruits and vegetables that were rich in highly fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, as well as insoluble
      fibers. In conclusion, three 45-min dietary guidance sessions, administered by a 
      nurse, reduced the symptoms and improved the quality of life of patients with
      IBS, and resulted in an adequate intake of vitamins and minerals. Individual
      dietary guidance is a cost-effective option for the management of IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract. This highly prevalent condition is best diagnosed by
      assessing the constellation of symptoms with which patients present to their
      physicians. Because some critics have previously questioned whether irritable
      bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders truly exist
      because they do not have defining structural features, the Rome Foundation
      fostered the use of symptom-based criteria for universal use. In most cases
      treatment is reduced to symptomatic therapy because a lot of unknown in
      pathogenesis by irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome leads to
      decrease of quality of life of the patients and could be one of the reasons of
      patients' disability. Food is believed by patients promotes symptoms and the diet
      or avoiding specific food can reduce symptoms. Possible role of different food
      and microbiota in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome, as well as the
      data from randomized, controlled clinical trials dedicated to the effects of diet
      in irritable bowel syndrome are summarized and discussed in this review. The
      efficacy of the diet, enriched by fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, peppermint oil, 
      curcumin and vitamin B6 in irritable bowel syndrome patients was shown in
      numerous studies. In some studies restriction in consumption of fermented
      carbohydrates, coffee and alcohol, as well as diet with elimination IgG-sensed
      food was also shown to be effective in irritable bowel syndrome. Food
      intolerances, defined as non-toxic non-immune adverse reactions to food, include 
      reactions to bioactive chemicals in foods and metabolic reactions to poorly
      absorbed dietary carbohydrates. New dietary approaches like polyunsaturated fatty
      acids intake correction and the low tryptophan intake are discussed.

TI  - Mental, physical, dietary, and nutritional effects on irritable bowel syndrome in
      young Japanese women.
PG  - 1295-301
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal
      disorder. The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III criteria in young Japanese
      women and to assess the effects of mental, physical, dietary and nutritional
      factors on IBS. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data obtained from
      self-administered questionnaires, including age, height, weight, lifestyle, food 
      habits, anxiety and depressive states and IBS-related symptoms, were analyzed in 
      245 participants. An established semiquantitative questionnaire available for
      clinical investigation (FFQg) was used to obtain a detailed assessment of food
      intake and the physical activity levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was
      12.0%. Of the IBS participants, constipation-predominant IBS (25.0%) was more
      prevalent than the diarrhea-predominant subtype (17.9%). The IBS participants had
      lower body mass indices, consumed less eggs and milk and were more physically
      active than the non-IBS participants. In addition, an anxiety state was more
      common in the IBS participants. Those who hesitated with evacuation of stool and 
      who thought that there is an association between abdominal symptoms, such as
      constipation and diarrhea, and menstruation were more predominant among the IBS
      participants. The percentage of individuals who reported often rushing to the
      toilet within the past year and experiencing borborygmus (rumbling stomach) was
      greater among the IBS participants. A logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      milk intake was an independent predictor of IBS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of
      IBS observed in this study was similar to that reported in previous studies
      conducted in Japan and other countries. Mental, physical, dietary and nutritional
      factors have an impact on IBS.

      beverage-a review.
PG  - 954-67

AB  - Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterraenea (L.) verdc) (BGN) is a legume; its origin
      have been traced back to Africa, and it is the third important legume; however,
      it is one of the neglected crops. It is highly nutritious, and has been termed a 
      complete food. Its seed consist of 49%-63.5% carbohydrate, 15%-25% protein,
      4.5%-7.4% fat, 5.2%-6.4% fiber, 3.2%-4.4% ash and 2% mineral compared to whole
      fresh cow milk 88% moisture, 4.8% carbohydrate, 3.2% proteins, 3.4% fat, 0.7%
      ash, and 0.01% cholesterol. Its chemical composition is comparable to that of soy
      bean. Furthermore, BGN has been reported to be a potential crop, owing to its
      nutritional composition, functional properties, antioxidant potential, and a
      drought resistant crop. Bambara groundnut milk (BGNM) had been rated higher in
      acceptability than milk from other legumes like soybean and cowpea. Probiotics
      have been defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate
      amount confer a health benefit on the host. These benefits have been reported to 
      be therapeutic, suppressing the growth and activity in conditions like infectious
      diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. The
      nutritional profile of BGNM is high enough to sustain the growth of probiotics.
      BGNs are normally boiled and salted, eaten as a relish or roasted, and eaten as a
      snack. Hence, BGNM can also be fermented with lactic acid bacteria to make a
      probiotic beverage that not only increase the economic value of the nutritious
      legume but also help in addressing malnutrition.

AB  - OVERVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), characterized by abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with a change in bowel patterns, is one of the most common 
      functional gastrointestinal disorders. Because no single drug effectively
      relieves all IBS symptoms, management relies on dietary and lifestyle
      modifications, as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. The
      authors review current approaches to treatment and discuss nursing implications.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption syndrome.
PG  - 473-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328361c556 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fructose malabsorption is associated with gastrointestinal
      symptoms. This review examines new findings on the physiology, assessment and
      therapy of fructose malabsorption in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Additional GLUT transport mechanisms that regulate fructose
      absorption might be involved in symptom adaptation to high-fructose diets.
      Although glucose is known to facilitate fructose absorption, erythritol promotes 
      malabsorption. The methodologies of fructose breath testing and its clinical
      utility have been questioned by findings of unrealistic testing dose and poor
      reproducibility. Although fructose restriction appears to benefit children with
      functional abdominal pain, fructose restriction itself may not be the key player.
      In irritable bowel syndrome, fructose restriction within a diet low in other
      fermentable carbohydrates fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide
      monosaccharide and polyols produced good symptom control compared with habitual
      diet, but such therapy resulted in significantly reduced bifidobacteria. Fructose
      absorption and subsequently, abdominal pain and nausea are improved by a novel
      enzyme therapy that converts fructose to glucose for absorption. SUMMARY: New
      insights into factors affecting fructose absorption may have therapeutic
      applications. Doubts surrounding clinical utility of fructose breath testing are 
      emerging. Although restriction of fructose and other fermentable,
      oligosaccharide, disaccharide monosaccharide and polyols have efficacy for
      functional gastrointestinal symptoms, potentially negative effects on microbiota 
      deserve attention.

TI  - Pediatric and adult celiac disease: similarities and differences.
PG  - 283-8
LID - 10.1007/s12664-013-0339-9 [doi]
AB  - Differences between children and adults in celiac disease (CD) presentation and
      epidemiology are reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, histological changes,
      serology, and response to gluten-free diet are similar. Differences exist in
      epidemiology, type of clinical presentations, coexisting diseases, complications,
      and association with obesity. CD is two to five times more common in children
      than in adults. Classical CD with gastrointestinal symptoms is more common in
      children whereas nonclassical CD dominates in adults. A gene dose phenomenon
      (double-dose HLA-DQB1 02 allele) is postulated to be responsible for this
      difference. Coexisting autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1,
      Sjogren's syndrome, and dermatitis herpetiformis are more common in adults than
      in children (42 % vs. 5 %). The association of overweight/obesity and CD is
      stronger in adults than in children (22.5 % vs. 14 %). Besides poor compliance,
      pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, irritable
      bowel syndrome, lymphocytic colitis, and microscopic colitis are considered
      responsible for nonresponsive CD in adults but not in children. Complications
      like refractory sprue and small intestinal neoplasms are seen exclusively in
      adults. Existing diagnostic criteria (modified ESPGHAN) are not suitable for
      diagnosing CD in adults as the majority of cases are either nonclassical or
      subclinical CD.

TI  - [Serum screening of celiac disease in Chinese adults with diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome in Hubei, China].
PG  - 38-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the prevalence of celiac disease with serologic markers in
      the central Chinese population, specifically in patients with chronic
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). METHODS: A total of 282
      adult patients with D-IBS were selected based on ROME III criteria with 296 age
      and sex matched consecutive healthy individuals as controls. A gluten-free diet
      (GFD) was advised in subjects positive for IgA/IgG anti-htTG/DGP antibodies and
      the serologic antibodies were retested after the GFD. RESULTS: Among the 578
      study subjects, five D-IBS patients (5/282, 1.77%) and two healthy controls
      (2/296, 0.68%) were positive for anti-htTG/DGP antibodies. Among the seven
      positive cases, one was lost to follow-up and only four were evaluated during GFD
      therapy for an average of 5.2 months with clinical and/or serological
      manifestations improved. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease may not be
      uncommon in China. Compared with the healthy population, patients with D-IBS tend
      to be affected more. Thus, it is significantly important to conduct routine
      screening for celiac disease in patients with D-IBS.

TI  - In functional dyspepsia, hypersensitivity to postprandial distention correlates
      with meal-related symptom severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hypersensitivity to gastric distention, an important feature
      of functional dyspepsia, is assessed by stepwise balloon distention of the
      proximal stomach in fasting patients. However, symptoms of functional dyspepsia
      are often worse after a meal, so studies of postprandial balloon distentions
      might be more relevant. We compared the effects of fasting and postprandial
      stomach distention in patients with functional dyspepsia. METHODS: Twenty healthy
      controls and 62 patients with functional dyspepsia participated in a gastric
      barostat study at Leuven University Hospital with graded isobaric distentions
      before and after a liquid meal. On a separate day, all patients underwent a
      gastric emptying breath test with assessment of postprandial severity of 6
      different dyspeptic symptoms scored at 15-minute intervals for 4 hours. For each 
      symptom, a meal-related severity score was obtained by adding all scores; the
      cumulative symptom score (CSS) was obtained by adding individual symptom severity
      scores. RESULTS: In patients, but not in controls, postprandial sensitivity to
      balloon distention was significantly greater than fasting sensitivity. The CSS
      and individual symptom scores did not differ between patients with normal or
      hypersensitivity to fasting distention, but patients who were hypersensitive to
      postprandial distention had a significantly higher CSS, along with scores for
      postprandial fullness, bloating, and nausea (all P < .05). On multivariate
      analysis, hypersensitivity to postprandial distention was associated with
      hypersensitivity to fasting distention and with impaired accommodation to a meal.
      CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial, but not fasting, distention thresholds are related to 
      the severity of meal-related symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia.

TI  - Lactose malabsorption diagnosed by 50-g dose is inferior to assess clinical
      intolerance and to predict response to milk withdrawal than 25-g dose in an
      endemic area.
PG  - 1462-8
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12273 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), diagnosed currently using lactose
      hydrogen breath and tolerance tests (LHBT, LTT) with a high, nonphysiological
      dose (50-g), may mimic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In LM-endemic areas,
      clinically significant malabsorption (lactose intolerance) may be better
      diagnosed using a lesser dose, and positive results so obtained may predict
      response to milk withdrawal more effectively. METHODS: Fifty patients each with
      IBS (Rome III) were evaluated using LHBT and LTT with 50-g, 25-g, and 12-g
      lactose. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT and LTT with different dosages (gold
      standard: lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism) and symptom development were
      evaluated. Effect of milk withdrawal was studied. RESULT: Of 150 patients, 37/50 
      (74%) and 28/50 (56%) had LM by LHBT and LTT using 50-g lactose; 41/50 (82%) and 
      31/50 (62%) had LM using 25-g lactose, and 14/50 (28%) and 29/50 (58%) using 12-g
      lactose, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT using 50-g, 25-g, and 
      12-g lactose were 92.6%, 52.0%, and 94%, 60%, and 36.4%, 88.2%, and those of LTT,
      92%, 80.0%, and 84.8%, 82.4%, and 66.7%, 58.8%, respectively. Breath hydrogen
      correlated with lactose dose. Though patients developing symptoms with 50-g
      lactose exhaled more hydrogen than those remaining asymptomatic, hydrogen levels 
      did not differ following 25-g and 12-g dosages in relation to symptom
      development. Patients' milk intake was 335 +/- 92 mL/d ( approximately 16.7 +/-
      9.6-g lactose). Positive LHBT using 25-g dose better predicted symptom resolution
      than by 50-g and 12-g lactose. CONCLUSION: Twenty-five gram is the ideal dose of 
      lactose for LHBT and LTT in LM-endemic areas.

TI  - The low FODMAP diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome: a prospective study.
PG  - 895-903
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Current treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is
      suboptimal. Fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may
      trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients. Our aim was to determine
      whether a low FODMAP diet improves symptoms in IBS patients. METHODS: Irritable
      bowel syndrome patients, who had performed hydrogen/methane breath testing for
      fructose and lactose malabsorption and had received dietary advice regarding the 
      low FODMAP diet, were included. The effect of low FODMAP diet was prospectively
      evaluated using a symptom questionnaire. Furthermore, questions about adherence
      and satisfaction with symptom improvement, dietary advice and diet were assessed.
      RESULTS: Ninety patients with a mean follow up of 15.7 months were studied. Most 
      symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea
      significantly improved (p < 0.001 for all). 75.6%, 37.8% and 13.3% of patients
      had fructose, lactose malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      respectively. Fructose malabsorption was significantly associated with symptom
      improvement (abdominal pain odds ratio (OR) 7.09 [95% confidence interval (CI)
      2.01-25.0], bloating OR 8.71 (95% CI 2.76-27.5), flatulence OR 7.64 (95% CI
      2.53-23.0) and diarrhoea OR 3.39 (95% CI 1.17-9.78), p < 0.029 for all). Most
      patients (75.6%) were adherent to the diet, which was associated with symptom
      improvement (abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea all significantly
      associated with adherence, r > 0.27, p < 0.011). Most patients (72.1%) were
      satisfied with their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The low FODMAP diet shows efficacy
      for IBS patients. The current strategy of breath testing and dietary advice
      provides a good basis to understand and adhere to the diet.

TI  - [Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity: hype, or new epidemic?].
PG  - A6168
AB  - Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated inflammation of the small intestine caused 
      by sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins in genetically sensitive
      individuals. Recently, a novel gluten-related disorder has gained significant
      interest from the scientific community and mass media. This condition, known as
      non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, is characterised by gastrointestinal or
      extra-intestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence of
      underlying coeliac disease. Its symptoms overlap considerably with those of
      irritable bowel syndrome and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free
      diet is rapidly growing. No discriminative markers to support a diagnosis of
      gluten sensitivity have been identified; the perceived response to a gluten-free 
      diet after exclusion of coeliac disease is currently the best diagnostic and
      therapeutic marker. Its pathogenesis remains obscure but may be related to
      non-gliadin molecules in grains that stimulate the innate immune system of the
      intestine. Here, we summarise the current knowledge on this novel condition.

TI  - Chronic illness and disordered eating: a discussion of the literature.
PG  - 277-86
LID - 10.3945/an.112.003608 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating
      behaviors, the reasons why these practices are endorsed, and the potential
      consequences in youths and young adults with selected diet-related chronic health
      conditions (DRCHCs) and provides recommendations for eating disorder prevention
      interventions and research efforts. Although it remains unclear whether the
      prevalence of eating disorders is higher in those with DRCHCs compared with the
      general population, overall findings suggest that young people with DRCHCs may be
      at risk of endorsing disordered eating behaviors that may lead to diagnosis of an
      eating disorder and other health problems over the course of their treatment.
      Thus, health care providers should be aware that young people with DRCHCs may be 
      at risk of eating disorders and carefully monitor psychological changes and the
      use of unhealthy weight control methods. It is also important to develop and
      evaluate theory-based interventions and disease-specific eating disorder risk
      screening tools that are effective in halting the progression of eating disorders
      and negative health outcomes in young people with chronic health conditions.

AB  - Colonic diverticula are common in developed countries and complications of
      colonic diverticulosis are responsible for a significant burden of disease.
      Several recent publications have called into question long-held beliefs about
      diverticular disease. Contrary to conventional wisdom, studies have not shown
      that a high-fiber diet protects against asymptomatic diverticulosis. The risk of 
      developing diverticulitis among individuals with diverticulosis is lower than the
      10% to 25% proportion that commonly is quoted, and may be as low as 1% over 11
      years. Nuts and seeds do not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular 
      bleeding. It is unclear whether diverticulosis, absent diverticulitis, or overt
      colitis is responsible for chronic gastrointestinal symptoms or worse quality of 
      life. The role of antibiotics in acute diverticulitis has been challenged by a
      large randomized trial that showed no benefit in selected patients. The decision 
      to perform elective surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis and not
      routinely after a second episode of diverticulitis, when there has been a
      complication, or in young people. A colonoscopy should be performed to exclude
      colon cancer after an attack of acute diverticulitis but may not alter outcomes
      among individuals who have had a colonoscopy before the attack. Given these
      surprising findings, it is time to reconsider conventional wisdom about
      diverticular disease.

TI  - A dietary survey of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food is one of the most commonly reported triggers of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms. However, the role of diet in the aetiology and
      management of IBS has not been clearly established. The present study aimed to
      examine the dietary practices of Irish patients with IBS and to determine whether
      these practices increased their vulnerability to nutritional inadequacies.
      METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 135 IBS patients on their perceptions
      of the role of diet in their symptoms and whether they restrict their diet
      according to the symptoms experienced. A similar questionnaire was used to
      investigate the perceptions of 111 healthy subjects to the gastrointestinal
      symptoms experienced on the consumption of food. RESULTS: Food was considered to 
      cause or worsen their gastrointestinal symptoms in 89.6% of IBS patients compared
      to 55% of healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Cereal-based foods, predominantly bread
      or its components, were the most frequently cited (53.3%), and spicy foods
      (39.3%), vegetables and fatty foods (35.6% for both) also featured prominently. A
      significantly greater number of patients with IBS reported changing their diet to
      minimise symptoms compared to healthy controls (91.9% versus 45.5%, P < 0.001).
      In relation to whole food groups, milk products (9.6%), fruit (7.4%) and
      vegetables (5.2%) were those most commonly restricted, with only a small number
      of IBS patients seeking professional healthcare advice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority
      of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to food, and change their
      diet by limiting the foods that they perceive as problematic, with some
      restricting whole food groups. Few patients sought professional healthcare advice
      when implementing dietary change, possibly exposing a considerable number to an
      increased risk of nutritional deficiency.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) do not have
      celiac disease but their symptoms improve when they are placed on gluten-free
      diets. We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of 
      fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-,
      di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS.
      METHODS: We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 
      y, 6 men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria),
      but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a
      2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g
      gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g
      whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2
      weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and 
      immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed
      over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey (16 g/d), or control (no additional
      protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales.
      RESULTS: In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and
      significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened
      to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein.
      Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8% of participants. There were no
      diet-specific changes in any biomarker. During the 3-day rechallenge,
      participants' symptoms increased by similar levels among groups. Gluten-specific 
      gastrointestinal effects were not reproduced. An order effect was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled, cross-over rechallenge study, we found no
      evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of gluten in patients with NCGS
      placed diets low in FODMAPs.

TI  - Self-reported food-related gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS are common and
      associated with more severe symptoms and reduced quality of life.
PG  - 634-41

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that food and diet are central issues, that concern 
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the current understanding about the
      association between the intake of certain foods/food groups and the
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptom pattern, psychological symptoms, and quality of
      life is poor. The aim of this study was to determine which food groups and
      specific food items IBS patients report causing GI symptoms, and to investigate
      the association with GI and psychological symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: 
      We included 197 IBS patients (mean age 35 (18-72) years; 142 female subjects) who
      completed a food questionnaire in which they specified symptoms from 56 different
      food items or food groups relevant to food intolerance/allergy. The patients also
      completed questionnaires to assess depression and general anxiety (Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression), GI-specific anxiety (Visceral Sensitivity Index), IBS
      symptoms (IBS-Severity Scoring System), somatic symptoms (Patient Health
      Questionnaire-15), and quality of life (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire). RESULTS: In all, 84% of the studied population reported symptoms 
      related to at least one of the food items surveyed. Symptoms related to intake of
      food items with incompletely absorbed carbohydrates were noted in 138 (70%)
      patients; the most common were dairy products (49%), beans/lentils (36%), apple
      (28%), flour (24%), and plum (23%). Of these, 58% experienced GI symptoms from
      foods rich in biogenic amines, such as wine/beer (31%), salami (22%), and cheese 
      (20%). Histamine-releasing foods, such as milk (43%), wine/beer (31%), and pork
      (21%), were also considered causes of symptoms in IBS patients. GI symptoms were 
      also frequently reported after intake of fried and fatty foods (52%). With
      increasing IBS symptom severity, patients reported more food items responsible
      for their GI symptoms (P=0.004), and this was also found in patients with more
      severe somatic symptoms (P<0.0001). Women tended to report more food items
      causing symptoms than men (P=0.06). A high number of food items causing GI
      symptoms was also associated with reduced quality of life and this was
      significant for the following domains: sleep (r=-0.25; P=0.001), energy (r=-0.21;
      P=0.005), food (r=-0.29; P<0.001), social functioning (r=-0.23; P=0.001), and
      physical status (r=-0.16; P<0.05). However, the number of food items reported to 
      provoke GI symptoms was unrelated to body mass index, age, IBS subtype, anxiety, 
      depression, or GI-specific anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IBS patients
      believe that certain food items are important triggers of their GI symptoms. This
      is especially true for foods containing carbohydrates and fat, and also may be
      relevant for histamine-releasing food items and foods rich in biogenic amines.
      Self-reported food intolerance is associated with high symptom burden and reduced
      quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonceliac gluten-sensitive (NCGS) patients report intestinal
      and extra-intestinal symptoms shortly after ingesting gluten; these symptoms
      disappear on gluten-free diets, although these patients have no serologic markers
      of celiac disease or intestinal damage. In fact, there is no evidence for mucosal
      or serologic modifications in those individuals. We investigated immunologic
      responses of duodenal mucosa samples and peripheral blood basophils, isolated
      from NCGS patients, after exposure to gliadin. METHODS: Participants underwent a 
      complete clinical evaluation to exclude celiac disease while on a
      gluten-containing diet, a skin prick test to exclude wheat allergy, and upper
      endoscopy (n = 119) at 2 tertiary medical centers in Italy. Patients were
      considered to have NCGS based on their symptoms and the current definition of the
      disorder. Subjects were assigned to the following groups: patients with celiac
      disease on gluten-free diets (n = 34), untreated patients with celiac disease (n 
      = 35), patients with NCGS (n = 16), or controls (n = 34). Duodenal biopsy samples
      collected during endoscopy were incubated with gliadin peptides, and levels of
      inflammatory markers were assessed. Peripheral blood basophils were extracted and
      incubated with gliadin peptides or a mix of wheat proteins; activation was
      assessed based on levels of CD203c, CD63, and CD45. RESULTS: Duodenal mucosa
      samples collected from 69 patients with celiac disease showed markers of
      inflammation after incubation with gliadin. Some, but not all, markers of
      inflammation were detected weakly in biopsy samples from 3 controls and 3 NCGS
      patients (P = .00 for all markers). There were no significant increases in the
      levels of CD63 and CD203c in NCGS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the duodenal
      mucosa from patients with celiac disease, upon incubation with gliadin, mucosa
      from patients with NCGS does not express markers of inflammation, and their
      basophils are not activated by gliadin. The in vitro gliadin challenge therefore 
      should not be used to diagnose NCGS.

TI  - Extending our knowledge of fermentable, short-chain carbohydrates for managing
      gastrointestinal symptoms.
PG  - 300-6
LID - 10.1177/0884533613485790 [doi]
AB  - The Monash University low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols) diet is now accepted as an effective strategy for
      managing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Australia, with interest
      expanding across the world. These poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates have
      been shown to induce IBS symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and
      flatus due to their poor absorption, osmotic activity, and rapid fermentation.
      Four clinical trials have been published to date, all with significant
      symptomatic response to the low FODMAP diet. Up to 86% of patients with IBS have 
      achieved relief of overall gastrointestinal symptoms and, more specifically,
      bloating, flatus, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habit from the approach. This
      review provides an overview of the low FODMAP diet and summarizes the research to
      date, emerging concepts, and limitations. FODMAPs are known to be beneficial to
      bowel health; the importance of this and how this should be considered in the
      clinical management of IBS is also discussed. A clinical management flowchart is 
      provided to assist nutrition professionals in the use of this approach.

TI  - Short-chain carbohydrates and functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 707-17
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.96 [doi]
AB  - Carbohydrates occur across a range of foods regularly consumed including grains
      such as wheat and rye, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Short-chain carbohydrates
      with chains of up to 10 sugars vary in their digestibility and subsequent
      absorption. Those that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the
      intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by
      bacteria with consequent gas production. These two effects alone may underlie
      most of the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms after they are ingested in
      moderate amounts via luminal distension in patients with visceral
      hypersensitivity. This has been the basis of the use of lactose-free diets in
      those with lactose malabsorption and of fructose-reduced diets for fructose
      malabsorption. However, application of such dietary approaches in patients with
      functional bowel disorders has been restricted to observational studies with
      uncertain efficacy. As all dietary poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates have
      similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has been developed to
      regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a dietary approach that restricts
      them all. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, there is now an accumulating
      body of evidence, based on observational and comparative studies, and on
      randomized-controlled trials that supports the notion that FODMAPs trigger
      gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders, and that a
      diet low in FODMAPs offers considerable symptom relief in the majority of
      patients who use it.

PG  - 323
LID - 10.1007/s11894-013-0323-7 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota alterations are increasingly being recognized as an important
      factor in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      The onset of IBS symptoms after a bout of gastroenteritis comprises one of the
      strongest indications for the importance of gut microbiota for IBS. Moreover,
      recent studies have identified several susceptibility genes for IBS involved in
      the innate immunity and recognition of bacteria but also maintaining the
      integrity of the intestinal barrier. During recent years, it has also been
      demonstrated that IBS patients, or subgroups thereof, may have an altered
      microbiota composition relative to healthy individuals, mainly based on the
      analysis of fecal microbiota. Moreover, a positive effect of treatment with
      non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics in IBS provides further indirect
      support for the relevance of gut microbiota alterations in IBS.

TI  - Fructose and lactose intolerance and malabsorption testing: the relationship with
      symptoms in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 1074-83
LID - 10.1111/apt.12306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of fructose and lactose intolerance and malabsorption
      with the symptoms of different functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID)
      remains unclear. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of fructose and lactose
      intolerance (symptom induction) and malabsorption and their association with
      clinical gastrointestinal (GI) as well as non-GI symptoms in FGID and the outcome
      of dietary intervention. METHODS: Fructose and lactose intolerance (defined by
      positive symptom index) and malabsorption (defined by increased hydrogen/methane)
      were determined in 1372 FGID patients in a single centre using breath testing.
      Results were correlated with clinical symptoms in different FGID Rome III
      subgroups. The effectiveness of a targeted saccharide-reduced diet was assessed
      after 6-8 weeks. RESULTS: Intolerance prevalence across all FGIDs was 60% to
      fructose, 51% to lactose and 33% to both. Malabsorption occurred in 45%, 32% and 
      16% respectively. There were no differences in intolerance or malabsorption
      prevalence between FGID subgroups. FGID symptoms correlated with symptoms evoked 
      during testing (r = 0.35-0.61. P < 0.0001), but not with malabsorption. Non-GI
      symptoms occurred more commonly in patients with intolerances. Methane breath
      levels were not associated with constipation using several cut-off thresholds.
      Adequate symptom relief was achieved in >80% of intolerant patients, irrespective
      of malabsorption. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose and lactose intolerances are common in
      FGID and associated with increased non-GI symptoms, but not with specific FGID
      subtypes. Symptoms experienced during breath testing, but not malabsorption,
      correlate with FGID symptoms. Effective symptom relief with dietary adaptation is
      not associated with malabsorption. Mechanisms relating to the generation of GI
      and non-GI symptoms due to lactose and fructose in FGID need to be explored
      further.

TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to
      date meta-analysis.
PG  - 19-36
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some
      probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing
      probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous
      data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in 
      cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS:
      meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for
      inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium
      breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48;
      95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; 
      -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve
      (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus
      casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All
      probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI,
      -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07;
      -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus
      salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a 
      clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: 
      some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the
      effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must
      focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the
      immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  - The role of food in the functional gastrointestinal disorders: introduction to a 
      manuscript series.
PG  - 694-7
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.62 [doi]
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by the presence
      of chronic or recurrent symptoms that are felt to originate from the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which cannot be attributed to an identifiable
      structural or biochemical cause. Food is associated with symptom onset or
      exacerbation in a significant proportion of FGID patients. Despite this, the role
      of food in the pathogenesis of the FGIDs has remained poorly understood. For this
      reason, diet has largely played an adjunctive rather than a primary role in the
      management of FGID patients. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion in
      our understanding of the role of food in GI function and sensation and how food
      relates to GI symptoms in FGID patients. In a series of evidence-based
      manuscripts produced by the Rome Foundation Working Group on the role of food in 
      FGIDs, comprehensive reviews of the physiological changes associated with
      nutrient intake, and the respective roles of carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and
      fats are provided. The series concludes with a manuscript that provides guidance 
      on proper clinical trial design when considering the role of food in FGIDs.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.63 [doi]
AB  - Despite years of advising patients to alter their dietary and supplementary fiber
      intake, the evidence surrounding the use of fiber for functional bowel disease is
      limited. This paper outlines the organization of fiber types and highlights the
      importance of assessing the fermentation characteristics of each fiber type when 
      choosing a suitable strategy for patients. Fiber undergoes partial or total
      fermentation in the distal small bowel and colon leading to the production of
      short-chain fatty acids and gas, thereby affecting gastrointestinal function and 
      sensation. When fiber is recommended for functional bowel disease, use of a
      soluble supplement such as ispaghula/psyllium is best supported by the available 
      evidence. Even when used judiciously, fiber can exacerbate abdominal distension,

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of a probiotic 'functional food' in the management 
      of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-13-45 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterised by
      pain, distension and altered bowel habit. Evidence suggests functional foods
      containing probiotics improve gastrointestinal transit, however, data are limited
      by short follow-up periods and evaluation in selected populations. METHODS: A
      multi-centre, randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the effect
      of a probiotic vs non-probiotic dairy product on symptoms in IBS with a
      constipation element (IBS-Constipation or IBS-Mixed profile). Set in 13 general
      practices within central England. Individuals meeting the ROME III criteria for
      IBS, aged 18-65 completed a pre-study diary. Eligible individuals were randomized
      to consume dairy 'yoghurt' products which either did or did not contain active
      probiotics twice daily and to complete a daily diary. Primary outcome was
      subjective global assessment of symptom relief at week 4. Other outcomes
      comprised, IBS symptom scores, pain, bloating and flatulence levels, stool
      frequency, stool consistency, ease of bowel movement and quality of life.
      RESULTS: 179 were randomized (91 active, 88 placebo). 76 (43 active, 33 placebo) 
      completed the study. No significant between group differences existed at 4 weeks 
      (57% active vs 53% placebo, reported adequate relief (p = 0.71)). By week 8, 46% 
      active vs 68% placebo reported adequate relief (p = 0.03). This was sustained at 
      week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements were reported for most outcomes in
      all trial participants but improvement did not differ by group. This trial does
      not provide evidence for effectiveness of a probiotic in IBS, in variance with a 
      body of published literature and review conclusions. Differential drop out may
      however cloud interpretation of data. UK TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN78863629.

LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

TI  - Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin: role of the aglycone in
      NF-kappaB inactivation in macrophages co-cultured with intestinal epithelial
      cells.
PG  - 522-33
LID - 10.1002/biof.1091 [doi]
AB  - The flavonoid luteolin is reported to exert anti-inflammatory properties. In this
      study, we investigated whether luteolin inhibits gut inflammation, using in vivo 
      and in vitro inflammation models. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
      colitis mouse model, luteolin (20 and 50 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated
      shortening of colon length and histological score. Immunohistochemical analysis
      showed that luteolin also significantly inhibited infiltration of macrophages and
      interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells into the colonic mucosa.
      Treatment with luteolin also improved IFN-gamma mRNA expression in the colon. At 
      the cellular level, a co-culture consisting of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 and
      macrophage RAW264.7 cells, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, the addition of
      luteolin (100 muM) suppressed interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells 
      without epithelial monolayer disruption. Expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha protein and proinflammatory cytokines mRNA (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and
      IL-1beta) in RAW264.7 cells were also suppressed. HPLC analysis and subsequent
      cellular assay revealed that aglycone of luteolin was present in the basolateral 
      supernatant of this system at a sufficient concentration to suppress TNF-alpha
      production and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation of RAW264.7 cells. These
      results suggest that the luteolin aglycones released from the Caco-2 epithelium
      inhibits NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells, followed by reduction
      of TNF-alpha mRNA expression, which results in downregulation of IL-8 mRNA
      expression in Caco-2 cells. The mechanism by which aglycone inhibits inflammation
      is important for understanding the roles of luteolin in diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS-D) could benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We performed a
      randomized controlled 4-week trial of a gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD in 45
      patients with IBS-D; genotype analysis was performed for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8.
      Twenty-two patients were placed on the GCD (11 HLA-DQ2/8 negative and 11
      HLA-DQ2/8 positive) and 23 patients were placed on the GFD (12 HLA-DQ2/8 negative
      and 11 HLA-DQ2/8 positive). We measured bowel function daily, small-bowel (SB)
      and colonic transit, mucosal permeability (by lactulose and mannitol excretion), 
      and cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells after exposure to
      gluten and rice. We collected rectosigmoid biopsy specimens from 28 patients,
      analyzed levels of messenger RNAs encoding tight junction proteins, and performed
      H&E staining and immunohistochemical analyses. Analysis of covariance models was 
      used to compare data from the GCD and GFD groups. RESULTS: Subjects on the GCD
      had more bowel movements per day (P = .04); the GCD had a greater effect on bowel
      movements per day of HLA-DQ2/8-positive than HLA-DQ2/8-negative patients (P =
      .019). The GCD was associated with higher SB permeability (based on 0-2 h levels 
      of mannitol and the lactulose:mannitol ratio); SB permeability was greater in
      HLA-DQ2/8-positive than HLA-DQ2/8-negative patients (P = .018). No significant
      differences in colonic permeability were observed. Patients on the GCD had a
      small decrease in expression of zonula occludens 1 in SB mucosa and significant
      decreases in expression of zonula occludens 1, claudin-1, and occludin in
      rectosigmoid mucosa; the effects of the GCD on expression were significantly
      greater in HLA-DQ2/8-positive patients. The GCD vs the GFD had no significant
      effects on transit or histology. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced
      higher levels of interleukin-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and
      transforming growth factor-alpha in response to gluten than rice (unrelated to
      HLA genotype). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten alters bowel barrier functions in patients
      with IBS-D, particularly in HLA-DQ2/8-positive patients. These findings reveal a 
      reversible mechanism for the disorder. Clinical trials.govNCT01094041.

AB  - AIM: To assess the effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) diet
      supplement in pediatric chronic abdominal pain (CAP) and irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in sixty
      children (8-16 years) with functional bowel disorders, such as CAP or IBS,
      diagnosed according to Rome III criteria. All patients underwent ultrasound,
      blood and stool examinations to rule out any organic disease. Patients were
      allocated to receive PHGG at dosage of 5 g/d (n = 30) or placebo (fruit-juice n =
      30) for 4 wk. The evaluation of the efficacy of fiber supplement included IBS
      symptom severity score (Birmingham IBS Questionnaire), severity of abdominal pain
      (Wong-Baker Face Pain Rating Score) and bowel habit (Bristol Stool Scale).
      Symptom scores were completed at 2, 4, and 8 wk. The change from baseline in the 
      symptom severity scale at the end of treatment and at 4 wk follow-up after
      treatment was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate
      compliance to supplementation with the PHGG in the pediatric population.
      Differences within groups during the treatment period and follow-up were
      evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The results of the study
      were assessed considering some variables, such as frequency and intensity of
      symptoms with modifications of the bowel habit. Both groups were balanced for
      baseline characteristics and all patients completed the study. Group A (PHGG
      group) presented a higher level of efficacy compared to group B (control group), 
      (43% vs 5%, P = 0.025) in reducing clinical symptoms with modification of
      Birmingham IBS score (median 0 +/- 1 vs 4 +/- 1, P = 0.025), in intensity of CAP 
      assessed with the Wong-Baker Face Pain Rating Score and in normalization of bowel
      habit evaluated with the Bristol Stool Scale (40% vs 13.3%, P = 0.025). In IBS
      subgroups, statistical analysis shown a tendency toward normalization of bowel
      movements, but there was no difference in the prevalence of improvement in two
      bowel habit subsets. PHGG was therefore better tolerated without any adverse
      effects. CONCLUSION: Although the cause of pediatric functional gastrointestinal 
      disorders is not known, the results show that complementary therapy with PHGG may
      have beneficial effects on symptom control.

      potential role for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

      disease.
PG  - 184-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835d7bba [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of lactase deficiency on digestive symptoms and
      diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not been well defined. 
      We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in 
      healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS).
      METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital,
      Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect
      malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in
      random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the
      dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose
      intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of
      controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS 
      were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 
      1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; 
      P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients
      with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 
      95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However,
      self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests.
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and
      intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported 
      LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with
      avoidance of dairy products.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease (CD) often report symptoms
      compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the prevalence of these 
      symptoms in patients with CD and their relation to adherence to a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) have not been assessed systematically. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012) to identify cross-sectional
      surveys or case-control studies reporting prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in
      adult patients (>/= 16 years old) with established CD. The number of individuals 
      with symptoms meeting criteria for IBS was extracted for each study, according to
      case or control status and adherence to a GFD. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios 
      (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. We analyzed data
      from 7 studies with 3383 participants. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of IBS-type
      symptoms in all patients with CD was 38.0% (95% CI, 27.0%-50.0%). The pooled OR
      for IBS-type symptoms was higher in patients with CD than in controls (5.60; 95% 
      CI, 3.23-9.70). In patients who were nonadherent with a GFD, the pooled OR for
      IBS-type symptoms, compared with those who were strictly adherent, was 2.69 (95% 
      CI, 0.75-9.56). There was also a trend toward a higher OR for IBS-type symptoms
      among patients who did not adhere to the GFD, compared with controls (12.42; 95% 
      CI, 6.84-11.75), compared with that observed for adherent CD patients vs controls
      (4.28; 95% CI, 1.56-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-type symptoms occur frequently in
      patients with CD and are more common than among controls. Adherence to a GFD
      might be associated with a reduction in symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapeutic potential of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based
      elimination diet among migraine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      BACKGROUND: Food elimination has been suggested as an effective and inexpensive
      therapeutic strategy in patients with migraine and concomitant IBS in the past
      studies. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 38.0
      [11.2] years; 85.7% females) diagnosed with migraine and IBS were included in
      this double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial composed of 
      baseline (usual diet), first diet (elimination or provocation diets), and second 
      diet (interchange of elimination or provocations diets) phases and 4 visits.
      RESULTS: IgG antibody tests against 270 food allergens revealed mean (standard
      deviation) reaction count to be 23.1 (14.1). Compared with baseline levels,
      elimination diet per se was associated with significant reductions in attack
      count (4.8 [2.1] vs 2.7 [2.0]; P < .001), maximum attack duration (2.6 [0.6] vs. 
      1.4 [1.1] days; P < .001), mean attack duration (1.8 [0.5] vs. 1.1 [0.8] days; P 
      < .01), maximum attack severity (visual analog scale 8.5 [1.4] vs. visual analog 
      scale 6.6 [3.3]; P < .001), and number of attacks with acute medication (4.0
      [1.5] vs. 1.9 [1.8]; P < .001). There was a significant reduction in
      pain-bloating severity (1.8 [1.3] vs. 3.2 [0.8]; P < .05), pain-bloating within
      the last 10 days (3.2 [2.8] vs. 5.5 [3.1]; P < .05), and improvement obtained in 
      quality of life (3.6 [1.4] vs. 2.9 [1.0]; P < .05) by the elimination diet as
      compared with provocation diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that food
      elimination based on IgG antibodies in migraine patients who suffer from
      concomitant IBS may effectively reduce symptoms from both disorders with possible
      positive impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as potential
      savings to the health-care system.

TI  - Functions of intestinal microflora in children.
PG  - 31-8
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835a3500 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the structural composition of intestinal
      microbiota, the functional relationship between the latter and the host, and the 
      role of abnormal microflora in chronic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: A more complete
      view of the gut microbiota is being developed following the Human Microbiome
      Project. The microflora in children is plastic, susceptible to changes in
      response to diet modifications, antibiotic treatment and other events, providing 
      the opportunity to study its functional role. Increasing evidence highlights the 
      role of nutrition in the age-related development of microflora. Eubiosis, that
      is, a normal microflora structure, provides protection against infections,
      educates the immune system, ensures tolerance to foods, and contributes to
      nutrient digestion and energy harvest. Changes in microflora, consisting in the
      overpresence of harmful species or underpresence of commensal species, or
      dysbiosis produce dysfunctions, such as intestinal inflammation or dysmotility.
      Moreover abnormal pattern of microflora have been consistently detected in
      specific diseases. SUMMARY: A relationship exists between eubiosis and functions 
      and conversely between dysbiosis and dysfunctions or even diseases. Abnormalities
      in microflora composition may trigger or contribute to specific diseases. This
      raises the hypothesis to target microflora in order to restore eubiosis through
      the use of antibiotics, probiotics or nutrients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of food hypersensitivity (FH) in adult patients with
      gastrointestinal symptoms, beyond the immediate IgE-mediated clinical
      manifestations, is very often difficult. The aims of our study were to: 1)
      evaluate the frequency of FH in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      clinical presentation; and 2) compare the diagnostic accuracy of two different
      methods of in vitro basophil activation tests. METHODS: Three hundred and five
      patients (235 females, age range 18-66 years) were included and underwent a
      diagnostic elimination diet and successive double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC)
      challenges. Two different methods of in vitro basophil activation tests (BAT)
      (CD63 expression after in vitro wheat or cow's milk proteins stimulation) were
      evaluated: one was performed on separated leukocytes, and the other on whole
      blood. RESULTS: Ninety patients of the 305 studied (29.5%) were positive to the
      challenges and were diagnosed as suffering from FH. BAT on separate leukocytes
      showed a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 91% in FH diagnosis. BAT on
      whole blood showed a sensitivity of 15%-20% and a specificity of 73% in FH
      diagnosis (p<0.0001 compared to the other method). CONCLUSIONS: About one third
      of the IBS patients included in the study were suffering from FH and were cured
      on the elimination diet. The BAT based on CD63 detection on whole blood samples
      did not work in FH diagnosis and showed a significantly lower sensitivity,
      specificity and diagnostic accuracy than the assay based on separated leukocytes.

TI  - The colonic microbiota in health and disease.
PG  - 49-54
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835a3493 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diverse research interests have converged on the gut
      microbiota because of its contribution to immune development, mucosal homeostasis
      and to the pathogenesis of a diversity of intestinal and extraintestinal
      disorders. Recent landmark findings are addressed here. RECENT FINDINGS: The
      impact of lifestyle, including dietary changes and antibiotics, on the microbiota
      has been mechanistically linked with disease risk. Microbial, immune and
      metabolic signalling are mutually interactive, with each of these being regulated
      by diet. Although changes in the microbiota have been found in several disorders 
      and may have important therapeutic implications, some components of the commensal
      microbiota may behave like pathogens (pathobionts) depending on the context and
      host susceptibility. SUMMARY: Advances in understanding host-microbe interactions
      in the gut continue apace, they are relevant to a diversity of infectious,
      inflammatory, neoplastic and metabolic disorders and are poised for clinical
      translation.

TI  - Nutrient intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with the
      general population.
PG  - 23-30.e1
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS.
      Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to
      the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups
      based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate 
      if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187
      IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food
      registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control 
      group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic
      Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was 
      similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations.
      Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from
      macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended
      to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher
      daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well
      as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no
      association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food
      items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large
      extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency
      toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy
      products in IBS patients.

TI  - A randomised clinical trial (RCT) of a symbiotic mixture in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): effects on symptoms, colonic transit and quality 
      of life.
PG  - 349-58
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1552-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised
      placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain
      symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is
      only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS.
      METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The
      primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and
      bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of
      treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in
      abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale,
      stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale
      and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time
      (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS
      patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were
      studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of
      treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of
      responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the
      treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in
      most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This
      symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of
      flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect
      profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory
      relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders: a Rome foundation report.
PG  - 159-76
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302167 [doi]
AB  - It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important
      elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The
      most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a
      bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in
      the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the
      evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The
      introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major
      advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from
      16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and 
      qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS.
      Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS.
      The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal
      innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate
      nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we
      await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic
      target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics,
      probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although
      most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the
      authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the
      pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of
      microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on 
      modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.
