AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-containing diet alters bowel barrier function in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), particularly those 
      who are positive for HLA allele DQ2/8. We studied the effects of a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) in patients with IBS-D who have not previously considered the effects 
      of gluten in their diet and were unaware of their HLA-DQ2/8 genotype. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective study of 41 patients with IBS-D (20 HLA-DQ2/8-positive
      and 21 HLA-DQ2/8-negative) at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, United
      Kingdom, from September 2012 through July 2015. All subjects were placed on a
      6-week GFD following evaluation by a dietician. Subjects completed validated
      questionnaires at baseline and Week 6 of the GFD. The primary endpoint was mean
      change in IBS Symptom Severity Score; a 50-point reduction was considered to
      indicate a clinical response. Secondary endpoints were changes in hospital
      anxiety and depression score, fatigue impact score, and Short Form-36 results.
      Clinical responders who chose to continue a GFD after the study period were
      evaluated on average 18 months later to assess diet durability, symptom scores,
      and anthropometric and biochemical status. RESULTS: A 6-week GFD reduced IBS
      Symptom Severity Score by >/=50 points in 29 patients overall (71%). The mean
      total IBS Symptom Severity Score decreased from 286 before the diet to 131 points
      after 6 weeks on the diet (P < .001); the reduction was similar in each HLA-DQ
      group. However, HLA-DQ2/8-negative subjects had a greater reduction in abdominal 
      distention (P = .04). Both groups had marked mean improvements in hospital
      anxiety and depression scores, fatigue impact score, and Short Form-36 results,
      although HLA-DQ2/8-positive subjects had a greater reduction in depression score 
      and increase in vitality score than HLA-DQ2/8-negative subjects (P = .02 and P = 
      .03, respectively). Twenty-one of the 29 subjects with a clinical response (72%) 
      planned to continue the GFD long term; 18 months after the study they were still 
      on a GFD, with maintained symptom reductions, and demonstrated similar
      anthropometric and biochemical features compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: A
      dietitian-led GFD provided sustained benefit to patients with IBS-D. The symptoms
      that improved differed in magnitude according to HLA-DQ status. Clinical
      trials.gov no: NCT02528929.

TI  - The Overlap between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A
      Clinical Dilemma.
PG  - 10417-26
LID - 10.3390/nu7125541 [doi]
AB  - The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes
      celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of 
      symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or
      abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they 
      can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are 
      diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain
      asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for
      the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of 
      symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a
      dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from
      the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a
      gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both
      can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common
      pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well
      understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors
      such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function 
      and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal
      role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported
      to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the
      source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.

TI  - Prevalence and Predictive Factors of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in a
      Community-dwelling Population in Japan.
PG  - 3105-12
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.5378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal
      disorder characterized by chronic, relapsing abdominal pain or discomfort and is 
      associated with disturbed defecation. The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III
      criteria and to assess the effects of mental and lifestyle factors on IBS in a
      community-dwelling population in Japan. METHODS: The diagnosis of irritable bowel
      syndrome was based on the Japanese version of the Rome III Questionnaire. The
      questionnaire was administered to 993 volunteers who participated in the Iwaki
      Health Promotion Project 2013. Diet was assessed with a validated brief-type
      self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns based on 52
      predefined food groups [energy-adjusted food (g/d)] were extracted using a
      principal component analysis. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
      Scale with a cut-off point of 16 was used to assess the prevalence of depression.
      RESULTS: A total of 61 subjects (6.1%) were classified as having IBS. Three
      dietary patterns were identified: "Healthy", "Western" and "Alcohol and
      accompanying" dietary patterns. After adjusting for potential confounders, the
      "Alcohol and accompanying" dietary pattern and depression were related to the
      risk of IBS. CONCLUSION: We found that an "Alcohol and accompanying" dietary
      pattern and depression were related to the risk of IBS in a Japanese community
      population. However, we could not rule out the possibility of some selection
      bias. Further studies with longitudinal observations are therefore warranted.

      bowel syndrome?
PG  - 536-40
LID - 10.7861/clinmedicine.15-6-536 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluates the efficacy of low-fat dietary interventions in the
      management of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms due to bile acid malabsorption. In
      total, 40 patients with GI symptoms and a 7-day (75)selenium homocholic acid
      taurine (SeHCAT) scan result of <20%, were prospectively recruited and then
      advised regarding a low-fat dietary intervention. Before and after dietary
      intervention, patients rated their GI symptoms using a 10-point numerical scale, 
      and recorded their intake in 7-day dietary diaries. After dietary intervention,
      the median scores for all GI symptoms decreased, with a significant reduction for
      urgency, bloating, lack of control, bowel frequency (p >/=: 0.01). Mean dietary
      fat intake reduced to 42 g fat after intervention (p >/=: 0.01). Low-fat dietary 
      interventions in patients with a SeHCAT scan result of <20% leads to clinically
      important improvement in GI symptoms and should be widely used.

TI  - EHealth: self-management in inflammatory bowel disease and in irritable bowel
      syndrome using novel constant-care web applications. EHealth by constant-care in 
      IBD and IBS.
PG  - B5168
LID - B5168 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      are chronic gastrointestinal disorders of unknown aetiology of increasing
      incidence and changing disease activity or severity. Approximately 60-80% of IBD 
      patients suffer from IBS. Monitoring and treatment goals of IBD are to optimise
      the disease course by prolonging remission periods and preventing or shortening
      periods of active disease. Constant-care web-monitoring and treatment approaches 
      with active patient involvement have been proven effective in UC, increasing
      patients' adherence and improving the disease outcomes. AIM: To assess the
      feasibility and efficacy of the novel constant-care eHealth applications in: i)
      CD patients treated with infliximab (IFX), ii) UC patients with active disease on
      mesalazine, iii) IBS patients and iv) IBD patients with IBS on a low FODMAP diet 
      (LFD). METHODS: New constant-care web applications www.cd.constant-care.dk,
      www.meza.constant-care.dk and www.ibs.constant-care.dk in IBD patients were
      developed and assessed in this thesis. An integrated inflammatory burden measure 
      of disease activity, consisting of a subjective (clinical indices) and of an
      objective (faecal calprotectin) part and a treatment guide to drug doses and
      intervals, was incorporated into the web applications and used by patients.
      RESULTS: Web-guided IFX treatment in CD demonstrated patients' inter- and
      intra-individual variability in infusion intervals and provided patients with
      individualised treatment according to their needs. Web-guided treatment with
      multimatrix mesalazine was efficacious in a majority of UC patients with
      mild-to-moderate disease activity. Web-guided IBS-monitoring in IBD and in IBS
      patients on LFD was shown to be a feasible method that actively involved patients
      in their disease management and had a positive short-term impact on the disease. 
      Moreover, the new constant-care concepts were demonstrated to be safe and to have
      a positive impact on quality of life and adherence to treatment and helped to
      reduce the costs. CONCLUSIONS: The novel constant-care web applications have
      proven feasible in improving the disease outcomes in CD patients on IFX, in UC
      patients on mesalazine, and in monitoring IBS. These applications are expected to
      be implemented in the clinical practice of gastroenterology in Denmark in the
      coming years. Future studies will help to assess whether the natural disease
      course can be improved in the long-term.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal
      and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food
      in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy
      (WA). The prevalence of NCGS is not clearly defined yet. Indirect evidence
      suggests that NCGS is slightly more common than CD, the latter affecting around
      1% of the general population. NCGS has been mostly described in adults,
      particularly in females in the age group of 30-50 years; however, pediatric case 
      series have also been reported. Since NCGS may be transient, gluten tolerance
      needs to be reassessed over time in patients with NCGS. NCGS is characterized by 
      symptoms that usually occur soon after gluten ingestion, disappear with gluten
      withdrawal, and relapse following gluten challenge within hours/days. The
      'classical' presentation of NCGS is a combination of irritable bowel
      syndrome-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit
      abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), and systemic manifestations such
      as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, and anemia. In recent years,
      several studies explored the relationship between the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food and the appearance of neurological and psychiatric
      disorders/symptoms like ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia, autism,
      depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (so-called gluten psychosis). The
      diagnosis of NCGS should be considered in patients with persistent intestinal
      and/or extraintestinal complaints showing a normal result of the CD and WA
      serological markers on a gluten-containing diet, usually reporting worsening of
      symptoms after eating gluten-rich food. NCGS should not be an exclusion diagnosis
      only. Unfortunately, no biomarker is sensitive and specific enough for diagnostic
      purposes; therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS is currently based on establishing a
      clear-cut cause-effect relationship between the ingestion of gluten and the
      appearance of symptoms by a standardized double-blind, placebo-controlled gluten 
      challenge.

      with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 175-81
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the large intestinal endocrine cell types
      affected following dietary guidance in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study included 13 IBS patients and 13 control
      subjects. The patients received three sessions of individualized dietary
      guidance. Both the control subjects and the patients were scheduled for
      colonoscopies at baseline and again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary 
      guidance. Biopsy samples were taken from the colon and rectum and were
      immunostained for all types of large intestinal endocrine cells. The endocrine
      cells were quantified using computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The daily total
      consumption (mean+/-s.e.m. values) of fruits and vegetables rich in FODMAPs
      (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols)
      decreased significantly from 16.2+/-5.3 g before receiving dietary guidance to
      9.2+/-3.2 g after receiving dietary guidance (P=0.02). In the total colon, the
      densities of serotonin cells were 46.8+/-8.9, 10.5+/-2.1 and 22.6+/-3.2
      cells/mm(2) in control subjects and in IBS patients before and after receiving
      dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.007); the corresponding densities of peptide 
      YY cells were 11.6+/-1.8, 10.8+/-1.7 and 16.8+/-2.1 cells/mm(2), respectively
      (P=0.06). The cell densities for both serotonin and peptide YY did not change
      significantly in the rectum. The densities of somatostatin cells in the rectum
      were 13.5+/-3.0, 13.2+/-3.0, and 22.3+/-3.2 cells/mm(2) for control subjects and 
      for IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively
      (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The densities of the large intestinal endocrine cells tend
      to normalize following dietary guidance that may have contributed to the
      improvement of the patients with IBS symptoms.

AB  - The human gut microbiota encompasses a densely populated ecosystem that provides 
      essential functions for host development, immune maturation, and metabolism.
      Alterations to the gut microbiota have been observed in numerous diseases,
      including human metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and
      irritable bowel syndrome, and some animal experiments have suggested causality.
      However, few studies have validated causality in humans and the underlying
      mechanisms remain largely to be elucidated. We discuss how systems biology
      approaches combined with new experimental technologies may disentangle some of
      the mechanistic details in the complex interactions of diet, microbiota, and host
      metabolism and may provide testable hypotheses for advancing our current
      understanding of human-microbiota interaction.

TI  - [Lactose intolerance: past and present. Part 1].
PG  - 1532-9
LID - 10.1556/650.2015.30261 [doi]
AB  - Lactose intolerance is the most prevalent intestinal malabsorption disorder.
      After presentation of its history, the author describes the emergence of lactose 
      intolerance during the evolution of species, and the biochemistry of lactose as
      well as features of human and bacterial lactase enzymes are then described. The
      unequal distribution of lactose intolerance in different continents and
      population is discussed, followed by presentation of past and present prevalence 
      data in Hungary. Adult-type hypolactasia is caused by a polymorphism of the MCM6 
      gene located upstream from the lactase gene on the long arm of the chromosome 2. 
      It can be determined with the polymerase chain reaction. The intestinal symptoms 
      of lactose intolerance are well known, but its extra-intestinal manifestations
      are less recognised. Invasive diagnostic methods (determination of lactase
      activity from small intestinal biopsies, lactose tolerance test), are accurate,
      but have been replaced by the non-invasive methods; their gold standard is the H2
      breath test. Genetic testing is being used more and more frequently in Hungary
      too, and, presumably, the methane breath test will be also available in the near 
      future. Lactose intolerance can be accompanied by inflammatory bowel diseases,
      coeliac disease and irritable bowel syndrome; it could be established whether
      this association is causal or not in order to start a correct diet and therapy.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10-15% of the western population. Drug
      therapy for this entity has shown limited efficacy. The low Fermentable Oligo-,
      Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) diet has recently emerged as an
      effective intervention for reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS. Currently, 
      several mechanistic studies have proven the rational basis of carbohydrate
      restriction. In addition, high-quality evidence (prospective studies and
      randomized controlled trials) from a variety of countries supports the high
      effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet for IBS symptoms (70%), especially abdominal
      bloating, pain, and diarrhea. Importantly, this diet seems to be superior to a
      gluten-free diet for patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The most
      controversial features of the low FODMAP diet are its short- and long-term
      limitations (a high level of restriction, the need for monitoring by an expert
      dietitian, potential nutritional deficiencies, significant gut microbiota
      reduction, lack of predictors of response), as well as the potential lack of
      advantage over alternative dietary, pharmacological and psychological
      interventions for IBS. Although liberalization of carbohydrate intake is
      recommended in the long-term, the reintroduction process remains to be clarified 
      as, theoretically, global carbohydrate restriction is deemed to be necessary to
      avoid additive effects.

AB  - This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium,
      held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects 
      of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and
      inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology.
      Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on
      probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on
      probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases,
      the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects
      of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on 
      probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as
      well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet.
      Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including
      immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory
      properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between
      periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing,
      and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on 
      a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on
      the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic
      categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.

TI  - Alterations in serotonin metabolism in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 272-82
LID - 10.1111/apt.13459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonin (5-HT) metabolism have been postulated to
      play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However,
      previous reports regarding 5-HT metabolism in IBS are contradicting. AIM: To
      compare platelet poor plasma (PPP) 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) 
      levels and their ratio in a large cohort of IBS patients and healthy controls
      (HC), including IBS-subgroup analysis. METHODS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients
      and HC were evaluated for fasting PPP 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. Furthermore,
      GI-symptom diary, GSRS, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores were
      assessed in the 2 weeks before blood sampling. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty
      four IBS patients and 137 HC were included. No differences were detected in
      plasma 5-HT between groups. The 5-HIAA concentrations and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were 
      significantly lower in IBS compared to HC: 24.6 +/- 21.9 vs. 39.0 +/- 29.5 mug/L 
      (P < 0.001) and 8.4 +/- 12.2 vs. 13.5 +/- 16.6 (P < 0.01), respectively. Subtype 
      analysis for 5-HIAA showed all IBS subtypes to be significantly different from
      HC. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was significantly lower in the IBS-M subtype vs. HC.
      Linear regression analysis points to an influence of gender but not of
      GI-symptoms, psychological scores or medication use. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated
      that fasting 5-HT plasma levels are not significantly different in IBS patients
      compared to controls. However, decreased 5-HIAA levels and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in
      IBS patients may reflect altered serotonin metabolism in IBS. Gender affects
      5-HIAA levels in IBS patients, but no effects of drugs, such as SSRIs, or higher 
      GI-symptom or psychological scores were found.

PG  - 1683-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-106311 [doi]
AB  - Non-celiac non-wheat allergy wheat sensitivity is regarded as discrete
      glutensensitivity diagnosed after the exclusion of celiac disease and wheat
      allergy. Due to the absence of reliable biomarkers no exact prevalence rates are 
      known and estimations range between 0,5-6 %. Soon after ingestion of wheat,
      patients complain of intestinal symptoms mainly bloating, abdominal pain,
      diarrhea or nausea which improve fast under glutenfree diet. Often
      extraintestinal manifestation as tiredness, muscle or joint pain, headache and
      depression are reported. Actually, there are no serological markers and no
      intestinal mucosal damage was found in patients. The underlying mechanism of the 
      disease is completely unknown and beside of gluten other wheat proteins as well
      as amylase-trypsin-inhibitor or short chain sugars are discussed as triggers. In 
      addition, the involvement of the intestinal microbiome in pathology of
      glutensensitivity must be considered.

TI  - Low-FODMAP formula improves diarrhea and nutritional status in hospitalized
      patients receiving enteral nutrition: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind
      clinical trial.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0106-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) are poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates that play an
      important role in inducing functional gut symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet improves
      abdominal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable
      bowel syndrome. However, there were no study for the effect of FODMAP content on 
      gastrointestinal intolerance and nutritional status in patients receiving enteral
      nutrition (EN). METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 14-day
      clinical trial, eligible hospitalized patients receiving EN (n = 100) were
      randomly assigned to three groups; 84 patients completed the trial (low-FODMAP
      EN, n = 30; moderate-FODMAP EN, n = 28; high-FODMAP EN, n = 26). Anthropometric
      and biochemical parameters were measured; stool assessment was performed using
      the King's Stool Chart and clinical definition. RESULTS: Baseline values were not
      significantly different among the three groups. After the 14-day intervention,
      diarrhea significantly improved in the low-FODMAP group than in the moderate- and
      high-FODMAP groups (P < 0.05). King's Stool scores in diarrhea subjects were
      significantly and steadily reduced in the low-FODMAP group compared with the
      other two groups (P for time and EN type interaction <0.05). BMI increased
      significantly in the low- and high-FODMAP groups during the intervention (P <
      0.05 for both), and showed a trend toward increasing in the moderate-FODMAP group
      (P < 0.10). Serum prealbumin increased significantly in all groups by 14-day; by 
      3-day, it had increased to the levels at 14-day in the low-FODMAP group. At
      14-day, serum transferrin had increased significantly in the moderate-FODMAP
      group. In addition, subjects were classified by final condition (unimproved,
      normal maintenance, diarrhea only improved, constipation only improved, and
      recurrent diarrhea/constipation improved). Seventy-five percent of the diarrhea
      improved group consumed the low-FODMAP EN formula. 38.5 and 46.2% of recurrent
      diarrhea/constipation improved group consumed the low- and moderate-FODMAP EN
      respectively. BMI significantly increased in all groups except the unimproved.
      Prealbumin levels significantly increased in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent 
      diarrhea/constipation groups at 3-day and continued by 14-day, and in the
      constipation-improved group at 14-day. Transferrin levels significantly increased
      in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent diarrhea/constipation groups at 14-day.
      CONCLUSION: Low-FODMAP EN may improve diarrhea, leading to improved nutritional
      status and facilitating prompt recovery from illness.

TI  - Review article: insights into colonic protein fermentation, its modulation and
      potential health implications.
PG  - 181-96
LID - 10.1111/apt.13456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal
      health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful
      metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. 
      AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of
      colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for
      dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and
      pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation',
      'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate
      fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate
      diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and
      pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production 
      and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These
      metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal 
      inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and
      intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein
      intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and
      nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically,
      aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical
      importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein
      fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative
      colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake
      have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further
      clinical studies.

AB  - This article discusses the most interesting studies on functional and motor
      gastrointestinal disorders presented at Digestive Diseases Week (DDW), 2015.
      Researchers are still seeking biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome and have
      presented new data. One study confirmed that the use of low-dose antidepressants 
      has an antinociceptive effect without altering the psychological features of
      patients with functional dyspepsia. A contribution that could have immediate
      application is the use of transcutaneous electroacupuncture, which has
      demonstrated effectiveness in controlling nausea in patients with gastroparesis. 
      New data have come to light on the importance of diet in irritable bowel
      syndrome, although the effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet seems to be losing
      momentum with time. Multiple data were presented on the long-term efficacy of
      rifaximin therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhoea. In
      addition, among other contributions, and more as a curiosity, a study evaluated
      the effect of histamine in the diet of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is common in Caucasians, but thought to be rare in Asians.
      Our aim was to determine the prevalence of CD in Chinese patients with chronic
      diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).From July 2010 to August
      2012, 395 adult patients with IBS-D and 363 age and sex-matched healthy controls 
      were recruited in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Xiaogan Central
      Hospital in Hubei province, central China. Patients with IBS-D were diagnosed
      according to the Rome III criteria. Serum Immunoglobulin (IgA/IgG) anti-human
      tissue transglutaminase (anti-htTG)-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies
      were measured in a single ELISA (QUANTA Lite h-tTG/DGP Screen). Upper endoscopy
      with duodenal biopsies and HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genotyping were performed in
      seropositive subjects and a gluten-free diet was prescribed.Seven IBS-D patients 
      (7/395, 1.77%) and 2 healthy controls (2/363, 0.55%), were positive for
      anti-htTG/DGP antibodies. Of these 9 cases, 1 was lost to follow-up, 3 were
      suspected to have CD and 5 were eventually diagnosed as CD with intestinal
      histological lesions classified as Marsh Type II in 2 and Type III in 3. Of these
      5 diagnosed CD patients, 4 (4/395, 1.01%) were from the IBS-D group and 1 (1/363,
      0.28%) from the healthy control had asymptomatic CD. Two Type III CD patients
      with relatively high titers in the serologic assay were homozygous and
      heterozygous for haplotype HLA-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03 (HLA-DQ9.3), respectively.In
      the present study, CD was present in 1.01% of patients with IBS-D and in 0.28% of
      the control group. We like to suggest that the haplotype HLA-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03
      (HLA-DQ9.3), which is common in Chinese, is a new susceptibility factor for CD in
      China. Larger screening and genetic studies are needed in the Chinese population 
      of different regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to analyse the impact of education
      of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on their quality of life.
      METHODS: The study was carried out at the Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of
      the Independent Public Clinical Hospital No. 4 in Lublin and Gastroenterology
      Outpatient Clinic of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Regional Specialist Hospital
      in Lublin in the years 2010-2011. The quality of life was analysed using the
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (QOL-Q R. Schalock, K. Keith). The group of 83
      patients with the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, who gave their consent
      for inclusion in the study, was provided with information about the essence of
      the disease, disease-related diet and lifestyle, course of the disease,
      medications, and check-ups. RESULTS: Our patients educated by the physician,
      nurse and those provided with written information had substantially higher scores
      in multi-dimensional aspects of the quality of life after education. Six months
      after education patients with IBS showed a significantly higher quality of life
      in all aspects, i.e. Satisfaction, Competence/productivity,
      Empowerment/independence and Social inclusion/community integration. The
      understanding of the essence of their disease contributed to a decrease in
      anxiety associated with the neoplastic disease and worrying symptoms, which
      significantly reduced the incidence of complaints. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Quality of
      life of patients with irritable bowel syndrome is substantially reduced in all
      the examined spheres. 2. Education of patients with IBS resulted in enhanced
      quality of life and reduced disease-related complaints. 3. Education of patients 
      with IBS plays a significant role in the entire therapeutic process.

TI  - Relationship Between Microbiota of the Colonic Mucosa vs Feces and Symptoms,
      Colonic Transit, and Methane Production in Female Patients With Chronic
      Constipation.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.10.005 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(15)01436-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In fecal samples from patients with chronic constipation, the 
      microbiota differs from that of healthy subjects. However, the profiles of fecal 
      microbiota only partially replicate those of the mucosal microbiota. It is not
      clear whether these differences are caused by variations in diet or colonic
      transit, or are associated with methane production (measured by breath tests). We
      compared the colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota in patients with chronic
      constipation and in healthy subjects to investigate the relationships between
      microbiota and other parameters. METHODS: Sigmoid colonic mucosal and fecal
      microbiota samples were collected from 25 healthy women (controls) and 25 women
      with chronic constipation and evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing
      (average, 49,186 reads/sample). We assessed associations between microbiota
      (overall composition and operational taxonomic units) and demographic variables, 
      diet, constipation status, colonic transit, and methane production (measured in
      breath samples after oral lactulose intake). RESULTS: Fourteen patients with
      chronic constipation had slow colonic transit. The profile of the colonic mucosal
      microbiota differed between constipated patients and controls (P < .05). The
      overall composition of the colonic mucosal microbiota was associated with
      constipation, independent of colonic transit (P < .05), and discriminated between
      patients with constipation and controls with 94% accuracy. Genera from
      Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the colonic mucosal microbiota of patients
      with constipation. The profile of the fecal microbiota was associated with
      colonic transit before adjusting for constipation, age, body mass index, and
      diet; genera from Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Lactococcus, and Roseburia)
      correlated with faster colonic transit. Methane production was associated with
      the composition of the fecal microbiota, but not with constipation or colonic
      transit. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for diet and colonic transit, the profile
      of the microbiota in the colonic mucosa could discriminate patients with
      constipation from healthy individuals. The profile of the fecal microbiota was
      associated with colonic transit and methane production (measured in breath), but 
      not constipation.

TI  - Managing irritable bowel syndrome in primary care.
PG  - 21-4, 2-3
AB  - The classic symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are abdominal pain,
      bloating and some form of bowel dysfunction. The pain is typically colicky in
      nature and can occur at any site although most commonly it is on the left side.
      The abdomen feels flat in the morning and then gradually becomes more bloated as 
      the day progresses reaching a peak by late afternoon or evening. It then subsides
      again over night. Traditionally IBS is divided into diarrhoea, constipation or
      alternating subtypes. IBS patients frequently complain of one or more non-colonic
      symptoms, these include constant lethargy, low backache, nausea, bladder symptoms
      suggestive of an irritable bladder, chest pain and dyspareunia in women. The
      traditional view that IBS is a largely psychological condition is no longer
      tenable. Rectal bleeding, a family history of malignancy and a short history in
      IBS should always be treated with suspicion. Both pain and bowel dysfunction are 
      often made worse by eating. It is recommended that a coeliac screening test is
      undertaken to rule out this condition. Other routine tests should include
      inflammatory markers such as CRP or ESR. Calprotectin is a marker for leukocytes 
      in the stools and detects gastrointestinal inflammation. A negative test almost
      certainly rules out inflammatory bowel disease, especially in conjunction with a 
      normal CRP. Fermentable carbohydrates can have a detrimental effect on IBS and
      this has led to the introduction of the low FODMAP diet.

TI  - A Comprehensive Self-Management Irritable Bowel Syndrome Program Produces
      Sustainable Changes in Behavior After 1 Year.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed a comprehensive self-management (CSM) program
      that combines cognitive behavioral therapy with relaxation and dietary
      strategies; 9 sessions (1 hour each) over 13 weeks were shown to reduce
      gastrointestinal symptoms and increase quality of life in a randomized trial of
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), compared with usual care. The aims 
      of this study were to describe strategies patients with IBS selected and
      continued to use, 12 months after the CSM program began. METHODS: We performed a 
      cohort study to continue to follow 81 adults with IBS (87% female; mean age, 45
      +/- 15 years old) who received the CSM program in the previous clinical trial.
      During the last CSM session, participants selected strategies they intended to
      continue using to manage their IBS. CSM strategies were categorized into
      subthemes of diet (composition, trigger foods, meal size or timing, and eating
      behaviors), relaxation (specific relaxation strategies and lifestyle behaviors), 
      and alternative thoughts (identifying thought distortions, challenging underlying
      beliefs, and other strategies). Twelve months later, participants were asked how 
      often they used each strategy (not at all or rarely, occasionally, often, very
      often, or almost always). RESULTS: At the last CSM session, 95% of the patients
      selected the subthemes of specific relaxation strategies, 90% selected diet
      composition, and 90% identified thought distortions for continued use. At 12
      months, 94% of the participants (76 of 81) were still using at least 6
      strategies, and adherence was greater than 79% for all subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: We
      developed a CSM program to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life in
      patients with IBS that produced sustainable behavioral changes in almost all
      patients (94%) after 1 year of follow-up.

TI  - The Gluten-Free Frenzy: Fad or Fitting?
PG  - 213-7
AB  - Although the gluten-free diet has been recognized as therapeutic for individuals 
      suffering from celiac disease, it has been promoted recently for other
      indications, such as autism, chronic fatigue syn- drome, and irritable bowel
      syndrome, or simply as a healthy dietary choice for anyone. The basics of the
      gluten-free diet are explored, with evidence-based indications and nursing
      implications when patients choose gluten-free.

TI  - Lactose Intolerance in Adults: Biological Mechanism and Dietary Management.
PG  - 8020-35
LID - 10.3390/nu7095380 [doi]
AB  - Lactose intolerance related to primary or secondary lactase deficiency is
      characterized by abdominal pain and distension, borborygmi, flatus, and diarrhea 
      induced by lactose in dairy products. The biological mechanism and lactose
      malabsorption is established and several investigations are available, including 
      genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. Lactose intolerance depends not only
      on the expression of lactase but also on the dose of lactose, intestinal flora,
      gastrointestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and sensitivity 
      of the gastrointestinal tract to the generation of gas and other fermentation
      products of lactose digestion. Treatment of lactose intolerance can include
      lactose-reduced diet and enzyme replacement. This is effective if symptoms are
      only related to dairy products; however, lactose intolerance can be part of a
      wider intolerance to variably absorbed, fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides 
      and polyols (FODMAPs). This is present in at least half of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and this group requires not only restriction of
      lactose intake but also a low FODMAP diet to improve gastrointestinal complaints.
      The long-term effects of a dairy-free, low FODMAPs diet on nutritional health and
      the fecal microbiome are not well defined. This review summarizes recent advances
      in our understanding of the genetic basis, biological mechanism, diagnosis and
      dietary management of lactose intolerance.

TI  - Emerging role of fecal microbiota therapy in the treatment of gastrointestinal
      and extra-gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 483-91
AB  - In the recent decade our understanding of the role of the human gut microbiome
      has been revolutionized by advances in development of molecular methods.
      Approximately, up to 100 trillion (10(14)) microorganisms per human body colonize
      the intestinal tract making an additional acquired organ that provides many vital
      functions to the host. A healthy gut microbiome can be defined by the presence of
      the various classes of microbes that enhance metabolism, resistance to infection 
      and inflammation, prevention against cancer and autoimmunity and that positively 
      influence so called braingut axis. Diet represents one of the most important
      driving forces that besides environmental and genetic factors, can define and
      influence the microbial composition of the gut. Aging process due to different
      changes in gut physiology (i.e. gastric hypochlorhydria, motility disorders, use 
      of drugs, degenerative changes in enteric nervous system) has a profound effect
      on the composition, diversity and functional features of gut microbiota. A
      perturbed aged gut microbiome has been associated with the increasing number of
      gastrointestinal (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection - CDI) and
      non-gastrointestinal diseases (metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, fatty liver
      disease, atherosclerosis etc.). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a
      highly effective method in the treatment of refractory CDI. FMT is the term used 
      when stool is taken from a healthy individual and instilled during endoscopy
      (colonoscopy or enteroscopy) into a gut of the sick person to cure certain
      disease. FMT represents an effective therapy in patient with recurrent CDI and
      the effectiveness of FMT in the prevention of CDI recurrence had reached approx. 
      90%. There is also an increasing evidence that the manipulation of gut microbiota
      by FMT represents a promising therapeutic method in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. There is also an increased interest
      in the role of FMT for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and obesity which
      collectively present the greatest health challenge in the developed world
      nowadays. Targeting of gut microbiota by FMT represents an exciting new frontier 
      in the prevention and management of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal
      diseases that awaits further studies in preclinical and clinical settings.

AB  - Wheat products make a substantial contribution to the dietary intake of many
      people worldwide. Despite the many beneficial aspects of consuming wheat
      products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac disease
      (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can
      result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be
      excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from
      IBS symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation
      caused by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not
      clear that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence
      that carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS
      patients are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to
      a GFD.

TI  - The management of lactose intolerance among primary care physicians and its
      correlation with management by gastroenterologists: the SEPD-SEMG national
      survey.
PG  - 554-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The understanding of lactose intolerance (LI) is limited
      in some professional settings. Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva (SEPD)
      and Sociedad Espanola de Medicina General (SEMG) have developed a survey in order
      to: a) Analyze primary care physicians (PCPs) knowledge and clinical management; 
      and b) to compare results with those of a previous survey of Spanish
      gastroenterologists (GEs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent
      to SEMG members with 27 items on various issues: Demographics, occupational
      characteristics, outlook on LI, diagnostic tests, treatment, and follow-up.
      Results were compared to those from a survey of GEs. RESULTS: A total of 456 PCPs
      responded, versus 477 GEs. PCPs had an older mean age and longer professional
      experience. Level of understanding of LI was similar, albeit a higher proportion 
      of PCPs lacked epidemiological awareness (p < 0.01). GEs tended to consider LI a 
      "minor" condition (71.3 vs. 40.1%; p > 0.001), and LI symptoms as overlapping
      those of irritable bowel syndrome (93.5 vs. 88.2%; p = 0.005), although symptoms 
      perceived as suspicious of LI were similar in both groups. Dietary
      recommendations were recognized as the primary therapeutic approach. CONCLUSION: 
      This study reveals the outlook of PCPs on LI, and allows comparison with that of 
      GEs, as a basis for the development of strategies aimed at improving LI
      understanding, approach and management in our setting.

TI  - Clinical response in Mexican patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated with 
      a low diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAP).

LID - 10.1016/j.rgmx.2015.06.008 [doi]
LID - S0375-0906(15)00074-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The low FODMAP diet eliminates carbohydrates and fermentable alcohols
      because they are not absorbed by the intestine, but are fermented by the
      microbiota, causing bloating and flatulence. AIMS: To evaluate the clinical
      response to the low FODMAP diet in patients with the different clinical subtypes 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients attended to at
      the Gastroenterology Department in 2014 that were diagnosed with IBS based on the
      Rome III criteria were included in the study. They were managed with a low FODMAP
      diet for 21 days and their response to the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, 
      flatulence, and stool form pre and post-diet were evaluated through the visual
      analogue scale, Bristol scale, and patient overall satisfaction. The results were
      analyzed by means, 95% CI, and the Student's t test. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients 
      included in the study, 87% were women and the mean age was 46.48 years.
      Distribution was: IBS-C 64.5%, IBS-D 22.6%, and IBS-M 12.9%. The score for pain
      was 6.0 (95% CI 5.04-6.96) and the post-diet score was 2.77 (95% CI 1.60-3.95)
      (P<.001). The score for bloating was 7.10 (95% CI 6.13-8.06) and the post-diet
      score was 4.19 (95% CI 2.95-5.44) (P<.001). The score for flatulence was 5.94
      (95% CI 4.79-7.08) and the post-diet score was 3.06 (IC95% 1.99-4.14) (P<.001).
      The pre-diet Bristol Scale result was 3.68 (95% CI 3.14-4.22) and the post-diet
      result was 4.10 (95% CI 3.66-4.54) (P=.1). The satisfaction percentage was 70.9%.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this first study on a Mexican population with IBS, there was
      significant improvement of the main symptoms, including pain, bloating, and
      flatulence after treatment with a low FODMAP diet.

TI  - PancreApp: An Innovative Approach to Computational Individualization of
      Nutritional Therapy in Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - Medical nutrition therapy has a pivotal role in the management of chronic
      gastrointestinal disorders, like chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel
      diseases (Lesniowski-Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or irritable bowel
      syndrome. The aim of this study is to develop, deploy and evaluate an interactive
      application for Windows and Android operating systems, which could serve as a
      digital diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for the patient 
      and the doctor. The software is gathering details about patients' diet and
      associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals,
      specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the
      process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using 
      a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early
      results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest
      that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric
      interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in
      leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).

TI  - Diet low in FODMAPs reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome as well as
      traditional dietary advice: a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet with reduced content of fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs])
      has been reported to be effective in the treatment of patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no evidence of its superiority to
      traditional dietary advice for these patients. We compared the effects of a diet 
      low in FODMAPs with traditional dietary advice in a randomized controlled trial
      of patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, parallel,
      single-blind study of 75 patients who met Rome III criteria for IBS and were
      enrolled at gastroenterology outpatient clinics in Sweden. Subjects were randomly
      assigned to groups that ate specific diets for 4 weeks-a diet low in FODMAPs (n =
      38) or a diet frequently recommended for patients with IBS (ie, a regular meal
      pattern; avoidance of large meals; and reduced intake of fat, insoluble fibers,
      caffeine, and gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, and onions), with
      greater emphasis on how and when to eat rather than on what foods to ingest (n = 
      37). Symptom severity was assessed using the IBS Symptom Severity Scale, and
      patients completed a 4-day food diary before and at the end of the intervention. 
      RESULTS: A total of 67 patients completed the dietary intervention (33 completed 
      the diet low in FODMAPs, 34 completed the traditional IBS diet). The severity of 
      IBS symptoms was reduced in both groups during the intervention (P < .0001 in
      both groups before vs at the end of the 4-week diet), without a significant
      difference between the groups (P = .62). At the end of the 4-week diet period, 19
      patients (50%) in the low-FODMAP group had reductions in IBS severity scores
      >/=50 compared with baseline vs 17 patients (46%) in the traditional IBS diet
      group (P = .72). Food diaries demonstrated good adherence to the dietary advice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet low in FODMAPs reduces IBS symptoms as well as traditional
      IBS dietary advice. Combining elements from these 2 strategies might further
      reduce symptoms of IBS. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02107625.

LID - 10.1136/dtb.2015.8.0346 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that can have a significant 
      impact on a person's quality of life. The cause of IBS is unknown but several
      mechanisms have been proposed including visceral hypersensitivity, central
      sensitisation, abnormal gut motility and altered gut microbiota. IBS is
      challenging to manage and many patients report insufficient symptomatic relief
      from treatment. Approximately 60% of patients identify food as a trigger for
      their symptoms, and there has been interest in exclusion diets for managing IBS. 
      Dietary adaptation is a common self-management strategy for patients with IBS,
      with many self-diagnosing intolerance to specific foods. This may lead to
      patients adopting over-restrictive or inappropriate diets. In recent years, a
      diet low in poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates, known collectively as
      FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and
      polyols), has been advocated for the treatment of IBS. Here, we discuss the
      background to the FODMAP diet and review the evidence supporting its use for
      people with IBS.

      individual dietary intake needs: Focus on genetic and genomic technologies.
PG  - 119-33
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201500243 [doi]
AB  - With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because 
      of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary
      sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing
      susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal
      cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel
      syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such
      diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake
      overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have
      revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature 
      of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating
      vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data,
      including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a
      position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
      proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency
      has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for
      considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary
      supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might
      beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for
      optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: dietary interventions.
LID - 0410 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) varies depending
      on the criteria used to diagnose it, but it ranges from about 5% to 20%. IBS is
      associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor function and enhanced visceral
      perception, as well as psychosocial and genetic factors. People with IBS often
      have other bodily and psychiatric symptoms, and have an increased likelihood of
      having unnecessary surgery compared with people without IBS. METHODS AND
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following
      clinical question: What are the effects of dietary modification (gluten-free
      diet, a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides,
      and polyols [FODMAPs]) in people with irritable bowel syndrome? We searched
      Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June
      2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our
      website for the most up-to-date version of this review). RESULTS: At this update,
      searching of electronic databases retrieved 33 studies. After deduplication and
      removal of conference abstracts, 19 records were screened for inclusion in the
      overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 14 studies
      and the further review of five full publications. Of the five full articles
      evaluated, three RCTs were included. Based upon their own search, the
      contributor(s) added two additional RCTs that did not meet Clinical Evidence
      inclusion criteria; these have been added to the Comment section. We performed a 
      GRADE evaluation of the quality for two PICO combinations. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two interventions based on
      information relating to the effectiveness and safety of dietary modification
      (gluten-free diet or a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]).

AB  - Remission of gastrointestinal and general symptoms after gluten withdrawal has
      been described in some non-celiac individuals for nearly 30 years. Only recently,
      efforts have been made to define this entity, now referred to as "non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity". It includes patients that clinically respond to gluten free 
      diet without exhibiting allergic or autoimmune features to explain such response.
      Wheat allergy, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and symptoms induced by
      high FODMAPs (Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols) consumption
      are the main differential diagnoses. The relationship with neuropsychiatric
      disorders such as schizophrenia and autism has not been demonstrated, but
      currently it gives ground to great hope in families with affected children.
      Epidemiology of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not clear. It is described as
      more common among women and less common in children. Genetic and immune factors, 
      changes in intestinal microbiota and non-gluten components present in wheat
      grains are main factors postulated in the pathogenesis of this condition. To
      date, there are no specific biomarkers for non-celiac gluten sensitivity and
      diagnosis is reached by excluding other causes of disease. A trial with
      gluten-free diet and subsequent gluten challenge is the methodology most
      frequently used to confirm diagnosis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) belongs to functional gastrointestinal
      disorders and is characterized by abdominal pain and change in stool consistency 
      and/or bowel habits. Etiological factors include gastrointestinal peristalsis
      disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, chronic inflammation of the mucous
      membrane, dysbacteremia, intestinal infections, psychosomatic and nutritional
      factors. Gastrointestinal motility disturbances in case of IBS are manifested by 
      the inhibition of the intestinal passage, which favors the development of
      constipation or occurrence of diarrhea. The aim of the study was to evaluate IBS 
      symptoms and demonstrate the relationship between physical activity and place of 
      residence amongst Warsaw University students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was
      conducted in march, 2014 using a specific questionnaire, amongst Warsaw
      University students. The study group comprised 120 female patients, aged between 
      19 and 27 years (M=23.43; SD=1.29). The chi-square test was used for analysis,
      p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The BMI of
      investigated patients ranged between 16.30-31.22 kg/m2 (M=21.27; SD=2.71). The
      majority of respondents (76.6%) weighed within the normal limits. Abdominal pain 
      or discomfort occurred more frequently in the group of students who considered
      their physical activity as low. In case of respondents with a low physical
      activity bowel movement disorders and stool continence changes occurred more
      often, as compared to those with moderate physical activity. The most common
      symptom was rectal tenesmus, the least common-presence of mucous in the stool.
      Analysis showed that students with low physical activity were more frequently
      absent from school/work, due to abdominal symptoms. The respondents with moderate
      activity more often considered their abdominal symptoms, being associated with
      stress. CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms are common amongst Warsaw University students. 
      In case of respondents with low physical activity, abdominal pain or discomfort
      occurred more often. It has been demonstrated that diet and stress might
      contribute to the occurrence of abdominal symptoms, being evidence of IBS.

PG  - 7621-36
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i25.7621 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, the
      pathophysiology of which is not completely known, although it has been shown that
      genetic/social learning factors, diet, intestinal microbiota, intestinal
      low-grade inflammation, and abnormal gastrointestinal endocrine cells play a
      major role. Studies of familial aggregation and on twins have confirmed the
      heritability of IBS. However, the proposed IBS risk genes are thus far
      nonvalidated hits rather than true predisposing factors. There is no convincing
      evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, with the effect 
      exerted by diet seemingly caused by intake of poorly absorbed carbohydrates and
      fiber. Obesity is a possible comorbidity of IBS. Differences in the microbiota
      between IBS patients and healthy controls have been reported, but the association
      between IBS symptoms and specific bacterial species is uncertain. Low-grade
      inflammation appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of a major subset of
      IBS, namely postinfectious IBS. The density of intestinal endocrine cells is
      reduced in patients with IBS, possibly as a result of genetic factors, diet,
      intestinal microbiota, and low-grade inflammation interfering with the regulatory
      signals controlling the intestinal stem-cell clonogenic and differentiation
      activities. Furthermore, there is speculation that this decreased number of
      endocrine cells is responsible for the visceral hypersensitivity, disturbed
      gastrointestinal motility, and abnormal gut secretion seen in IBS patients.

TI  - The role of fiber supplementation in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000425 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder associated with a
      wide variety of clinical symptoms. The use of fiber in treatment of IBS is well
      established, but recent reviews have shown conflicting evidence. The aim of our
      review was to study the effects of fiber (soluble and insoluble) on the symptoms 
      of IBS. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov
      were searched for appropriate studies. Two reviewers screened the title/abstract 
      and full text against the inclusion criterion - that is, randomized control
      trials/crossover studies that compare fiber with placebo for its effect on IBS in
      an outpatient setting. Independent double data extraction was performed across
      multiple fields. An assessment of the risk of bias and tests for heterogeneity
      were carried out, along with a meta-analysis of the outcomes of interest. The
      search yielded 4199 unique records: 121 were selected after title/abstract
      screening and 22 after full screening. There was moderate clinical,
      methodological, and statistical heterogeneity across studies, with a moderate
      risk of bias. Overall, there was a significant improvement in global assessment
      of symptoms among those randomized to fiber [risk ratio: 1.27; 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 1.05-1.54]. Soluble fiber improved assessment of symptoms (risk
      ratio 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09-2.03), as well as the abdominal pain score (mean
      difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.72 to -0.97), with insoluble fiber not showing
      improvement in any outcome. Soluble fiber appears to improve symptoms of IBS,
      whereas there is no evidence for recommending insoluble fiber for IBS.

TI  - Does oral alpha-galactosidase relieve irritable bowel symptoms?
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1063156 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal bloating is reported by a majority of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients. Excess colonic fermentation may cause gaseous symptoms. 
      Several foodstuffs contain oligosaccharides with an alpha-galactosidic linkage
      that is resistant to mammalian hydrolases. Assisted hydrolysis by exogenous
      alpha-galactosidase enzyme (AG) could offer a way of controlling IBS symptoms by 
      reducing colonic fermentation and gas production. The aim of this study was to
      assess the effect of AG on symptom severity and quality of life in IBS patients
      with abdominal bloating or flatulence. METHODS: A total of 125 subjects with IBS 
      received AG or placebo at meals for 12 weeks. IBS-Symptom Severity Score
      (IBS-SSS) and quality of life (QoL) were assessed at baseline, during the
      treatment and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: AG showed a trend toward a more
      prominent decrease in IBS-SSS. The responder rate at week 16 was higher for the
      AG group. No difference was detected in QoL between AG and placebo groups. A
      total of 25 patients (18 in AG group and 7 in placebo group, p = 0.016) withdrew 
      from the study. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were more often reported as reason
      for withdrawal in AG group. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support the use 
      of AG routinely in IBS patients. Improvement of clinical response at 4-week
      follow-up may suggest a long-term effect of unknown mechanism, but could also be 
      attributed to non-responder drop out. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects may be a
      coincidence in this study, but irritation of GI tract by AG administration cannot
      be excluded.

TI  - The spectrum of noncoeliac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 516-26
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2015.107 [doi]
AB  - The past 5 years have seen an increase in the use of a gluten-free diet outside a
      diagnosis of coeliac disease or IgE-mediated wheat allergy. This trend has led to
      the identification of a new clinical entity termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity 
      (NCGS). In this Review, we discuss the evidence for NCGS as demonstrated by the
      results of double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary rechallenge studies.
      Furthermore, the characteristic phenotype of individuals with NCGS is described
      as well as the symptom manifestations commonly reported after gluten exposure,
      which include intestinal symptoms consistent with IBS, and extraintestinal
      symptoms such as neurological dysfunction, psychological disturbances,
      fibromyalgia and skin rash. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that NCGS can be
      associated with organic gastrointestinal pathologies, such as IBD, in which its
      presence might be a reflection of severe or stricturing disease. However, NCGS is
      not without its controversies and uncertainties, in particular pertaining to
      whether it is gluten or nongluten components of the grain evoking symptoms;
      evidence suggests that fermentable carbohydrates, amylase trypsin inhibitors and 
      wheat-germ agglutinin can also be responsible culprits. Finally, we discuss the
      novel techniques that might help diagnose NCGS in the future.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders, having a prevalence of 12%-30% in the general population. Most
      patients with IBS attribute their symptoms to adverse food reactions. We review
      the role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS and the importance of dietary factors
      in the management of these patients. The MEDLINE electronic database (1966 to Jan
      2015) was searched using the following keywords: "food", "diet", "food allergy", 
      "food hypersensitivity", "food intolerance", "IBS", "epidemiology",
      "pathogenesis", "pathophysiology", "diagnosis", "treatment". We found 153
      eligible papers; 80 were excluded because: not written in English, exclusive
      biochemical and experimental research, case reports, reviews, and research
      otherwise not relevant to our specific interest. We selected 73 papers: 43
      original papers, 26 reviews and 4 letters to the editor. These papers focused on 
      IBS pathogenesis, the association between IBS and atopy, and between IBS and food
      allergy, the relationship between IBS and non-celiac wheat sensitivity, the role 
      of diet in IBS. Pending further scientific evidence, a cautious approach is
      advisable but the concept of food allergy should be included as a possible cause 
      of IBS, and a dietary approach may have a place in the routine clinical
      management of IBS.

TI  - Symbiotics in irritable bowel syndrome--better than probiotics alone?
PG  - 485-9
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000199 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal
      disorder associated with significant physical and psychological comorbidity. The 
      etiology of the condition is uncertain but recent research suggests that the gut 
      bacterial composition may play a role in its development. Therefore, manipulation
      of the intestinal microbiome by using probiotics and symbiotics has the potential
      to improve patient outcomes in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous randomized
      controlled trials suggest a benefit of probiotics in the management of IBS, with 
      a significant reduction in the likelihood of symptoms persisting after therapy,
      and improvements in abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence when probiotics are
      compared with placebo. Evidence for the effect of probiotics on quality of life
      is conflicting. Relatively few randomized controlled trials have examined the
      effect of symbiotics on outcomes in IBS, but results thus far are promising.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in IBS. Data supporting the use of
      symbiotics is sparse. Whether symbiotics are superior to probiotics is unclear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet can ameliorate symptoms in adult irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) within 48 h. AIM: To determine the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet
      in childhood IBS and whether gut microbial composition and/or metabolic capacity 
      are associated with its efficacy. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover trial,
      children with Rome III IBS completed a 1-week baseline period. They then were
      randomised to a low FODMAP diet or typical American childhood diet (TACD),
      followed by a 5-day washout period before crossing over to the other diet. GI
      symptoms were assessed with abdominal pain frequency being the primary outcome.
      Baseline gut microbial composition (16S rRNA sequencing) and metabolic capacity
      (PICRUSt) were determined. Metagenomic biomarker discovery (LEfSe) compared
      Responders (>/=50% decrease in abdominal pain frequency on low FODMAP diet only) 
      vs. Nonresponders (no improvement during either intervention). RESULTS:
      Thirty-three children completed the study. Less abdominal pain occurred during
      the low FODMAP diet vs. TACD [1.1 +/- 0.2 (SEM) episodes/day vs. 1.7 +/- 0.4, P <
      0.05]. Compared to baseline (1.4 +/- 0.2), children had fewer daily abdominal
      pain episodes during the low FODMAP diet (P < 0.01) but more episodes during the 
      TACD (P < 0.01). Responders were enriched at baseline in taxa with known greater 
      saccharolytic metabolic capacity (e.g. Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae,
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and three Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
      orthologues, of which two relate to carbohydrate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In
      childhood IBS, a low FODMAP diet decreases abdominal pain frequency. Gut
      microbiome biomarkers may be associated with low FODMAP diet efficacy.

TI  - Diagnosis of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS): The Salerno Experts' Criteria.
PG  - 4966-77
LID - 10.3390/nu7064966 [doi]
AB  - Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal
      and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food,
      in subjects that are not affected by either celiac disease or wheat allergy.
      Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the
      procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts'
      recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the
      confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical
      response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten
      challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is
      performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version
      of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three
      main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale
      with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten
      challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout 
      of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle 
      should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 
      30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge
      should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The
      guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and
      positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies,
      if adopted internationally.

      gut symptoms.
PG  - 1249-57
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The precise relation of intestinal gas to symptoms, particularly
      abdominal bloating and distension remains incompletely elucidated. Our aim was to
      define the normal values of intestinal gas volume and distribution and to
      identify abnormalities in relation to functional-type symptoms. METHODS:
      Abdominal computed tomography scans were evaluated in healthy subjects (n = 37)
      and in patients in three conditions: basal (when they were feeling well; n = 88),
      during an episode of abdominal distension (n = 82) and after a challenge diet (n 
      = 24). Intestinal gas content and distribution were measured by an original
      analysis program. Identification of patients outside the normal range was
      performed by machine learning techniques (one-class classifier). Results are
      expressed as median (IQR) or mean +/- SE, as appropriate. KEY RESULTS: In healthy
      subjects the gut contained 95 (71, 141) mL gas distributed along the entire
      lumen. No differences were detected between patients studied under asymptomatic
      basal conditions and healthy subjects. However, either during a spontaneous
      bloating episode or once challenged with a flatulogenic diet, luminal gas was
      found to be increased and/or abnormally distributed in about one-fourth of the
      patients. These patients detected outside the normal range by the classifier
      exhibited a significantly greater number of abnormal features than those within
      the normal range (3.7 +/- 0.4 vs 0.4 +/- 0.1; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS &
      INFERENCES: The analysis of a large cohort of subjects using original techniques 
      provides unique and heretofore unavailable information on the volume and
      distribution of intestinal gas in normal conditions and in relation to functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI  - Sensitivity to wheat, gluten and FODMAPs in IBS: facts or fiction?
PG  - 169-78
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309757 [doi]
AB  - IBS is one of the most common types of functional bowel disorder. Increasing
      attention has been paid to the causative role of food in IBS. Food ingestion
      precipitates or exacerbates symptoms, such as abdominal pain and bloating in
      patients with IBS through different hypothesised mechanisms including immune and 
      mast cell activation, mechanoreceptor stimulation and chemosensory activation.
      Wheat is regarded as one of the most relevant IBS triggers, although which
      component(s) of this cereal is/are involved remain(s) unknown. Gluten, other
      wheat proteins, for example, amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fructans (the latter
      belonging to fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)), have
      been identified as possible factors for symptom generation/exacerbation. This
      uncertainty on the true culprit(s) opened a scenario of semantic definitions
      favoured by the discordant results of double-blind placebo-controlled trials,
      which have generated various terms ranging from non-coeliac gluten sensitivity to
      the broader one of non-coeliac wheat or wheat protein sensitivity or, even,
      FODMAP sensitivity. The role of FODMAPs in eliciting the clinical picture of IBS 
      goes further since these short-chain carbohydrates are found in many other
      dietary components, including vegetables and fruits. In this review, we assessed 
      current literature in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity
      represent 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms. This knowledge is expected
      to promote standardisation in dietary strategies (gluten/wheat-free and low
      FODMAP) as effective measures for the management of IBS symptoms.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is an undefined syndrome with gastrointestinal and 
      extra-intestinal manifestations triggered by gluten in patients without celiac
      disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis involves immune-mediated mechanisms
      requiring further research. Symptoms disappear in a few hours or days after
      gluten withdrawal and recur rapidly after gluten ingestion. Besides gluten, other
      wheat proteins as well as fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols
      (FODMAPs) may contribute to this syndrome. This syndrome occurs mainly in young
      women, being rare in children. Its prevalence ranges from 0.6% to 6%, based on
      primary or tertiary care center estimates. No biomarker is available, but half of
      patients tests positive for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, which disappear quickly 
      after gluten-free diet together with symptoms. Also, genetic markers are still
      undefined. Although currently limited to a research setting, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over trial strategy is recommended to confirm the
      diagnosis. Treatment is based on dietary restriction with special care to
      nutrient intake.

AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a condition that may be marked by abdominal
      pain, bloating, fullness, indigestion, belching, constipation and/or diarrhea.
      IBS symptoms can result from malabsorption of fructose. Fructose is a
      monosaccharide found naturally in small quantities in fruits and some vegetables,
      and in much larger quantities in industrially manufactured sweets with added
      sugars (e.g. sucrose and high fructose corn syrup). Fructose malabsorption leads 
      to osmotic diarrhea as well as gas and bloating due to fermentation in the colon.
      A low-fructose diet has been found to improve IBS symptoms in some patients. This
      paper discusses the prevalence of fructose malabsorption and considers fructose
      ingestion as a possible cause of--and fructose restriction as a possible dietary 
      treatment for--IBS.

TI  - Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity Has Narrowed the Spectrum of Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome: A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - 4542-54
LID - 10.3390/nu7064542 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have shown that a large number of patients who are fulfilling the
      criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are sensitive to gluten. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal
      symptoms in patients with IBS. In this double-blind randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial, 148 IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria were 
      enrolled between 2011 and 2013. However, only 72 out of the 148 commenced on a
      gluten-free diet for up to six weeks and completed the study; clinical symptoms
      were recorded biweekly using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS). In the
      second stage after six weeks, patients whose symptoms improved to an acceptable
      level were randomly divided into two groups; patients either received packages
      containing powdered gluten (35 cases) or patients received placebo (gluten free
      powder) (37 cases). Overall, the symptomatic improvement was statistically
      different in the gluten-containing group compared with placebo group in 9
      (25.7%), and 31 (83.8%) patients respectively (p < 0.001). A large number of
      patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome are sensitive to gluten. Using the 
      term of IBS can therefore be misleading and may deviate and postpone the
      application of an effective and well-targeted treatment strategy in gluten
      sensitive patients.

PG  - 2372-83
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.6.9023 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not
      digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach 
      the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified
      according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different
      physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of
      the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber
      intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many
      neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an
      important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current 
      evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several
      different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended
      fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by
      searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion
      criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber
      types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like
      constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or
      short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement
      with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the
      prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with
      hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from
      fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the
      prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further
      investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.

LID - 10.1177/1359105315573450 [doi]
AB  - This work aimed to study the effect of guided affective imagery on the irritable 
      bowel syndrome. A total of 15 irritable bowel syndrome patients received guided
      affective imagery and 19 patients served as controls. Symptom severity and
      irritable bowel syndrome quality of life were measured at baseline and 8 weeks.
      Symptom severity decreased following guided affective imagery compared to
      controls (-1.5 +/- 1.9 vs 0.1 +/- 1.6, p = 0.04). Irritable bowel syndrome
      quality of life increased following guided affective imagery compared to controls
      (12.1 +/- 12.5 vs -0.7 +/- 16.2, p < 0.01). Guided affective imagery predicted
      reduced symptom severity (odds ratio = 5.71, p = 0.02) and increased irritable
      bowel syndrome quality of life (odds ratio = 17.88, p = 0.01). Guided affective
      imagery combined with dietary modification may be beneficial in the management of
      irritable bowel syndrome, however larger studies are required.

TI  - Self-reported dietary fructose intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome: Proposed 
      diagnostic criteria.
PG  - 5677-84
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i18.5677 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To study the criteria for self-reported dietary fructose intolerance (DFI)
      and to evaluate subjective global assessment (SGA) as outcome measure. METHODS:
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients were randomized in an open study design
      with a 2 wk run-in on a habitual IBS diet, followed by 12 wk with/without
      additional fructose-reduced diet (FRD). Daily registrations of stool frequency
      and consistency, and symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) were performed
      during the first 4 wk. SGA was used for weekly registrations during the whole
      study period. Provocation with high-fructose diet was done at the end of the
      registration period. Fructose breath tests (FBTs) were performed. A total of 182 
      subjects performed the study according to the protocol (88 FRD, 94 controls).
      RESULTS: We propose a new clinically feasible diagnostic standard for
      self-reported fructose intolerance. The instrument is based on VAS registrations 
      of symptom relief on FRD combined with symptom aggravation upon provocation with 
      fructose-rich diet. Using these criteria 43 of 77 patients (56%) in the present
      cohort of IBS patients had self-reported DFI. To improve the concept for clinical
      evaluation, we translated the SGA scale instrument to Norwegian and validated it 
      in the context of the IBS diet regimen. The validation procedures showed a
      sensitivity, specificity and kappa value for SGA detecting the self-reported DFI 
      group by FRD response within the IBS patients of 0.79, 0.75 and 0.53,
      respectively. Addition of the provocation test yielded values of 0.84, 0.76 and
      0.61, respectively. The corresponding validation results for FBT were 0.57, 0.34 
      and -0.13, respectively. CONCLUSION: FRD improves symptoms in a subgroup of IBS
      patients. A diet trial followed by a provocation test evaluated by SGA can
      identify most responders to FRD.

TI  - Does a diet low in FODMAPs reduce symptoms associated with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 897-906
LID - 10.1007/s00394-015-0922-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain,
      bloating, distension, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence have been noted in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      The diversity of symptoms has meant that finding an effective treatment has been 
      challenging with most treatments alleviating only the primary symptom. A novel
      treatment option for IBS and IBD currently generating much excitement is the low 
      fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet. The aim of
      this meta-analysis was to determine the evidence of the efficacy of such a diet
      in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Electronic
      databases were searched through to March 2015 to identify relevant studies.
      Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the
      effect of a low FODMAP diet on the reduction in IBS [Symptoms Severity Score
      (SSS)] score and increase in IBS quality of life (QOL) score for both randomized 
      clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized interventions using a random-effects
      model. RESULTS: Six RCTs and 16 non-randomized interventions were included in the
      analysis. There was a significant decrease in IBS SSS scores for those
      individuals on a low FODMAP diet in both the RCTs (OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.25-0.76; I 
      (2) = 35.52, p = 0.00) and non-randomized interventions (OR 0.03, 95 % CI
      0.01-0.2; I (2) = 69.1, p = 0.02). In addition, there was a significant
      improvement in the IBS-QOL score for RCTs (OR 1.84, 95 % CI 1.12-3.03; I (2) =
      0.00, p = 0.39) and for non-randomized interventions (OR 3.18, 95 % CI 1.60-6.31;
      I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.89). Further, following a low FODMAP diet was found to
      significantly reduce symptom severity for abdominal pain (OR 1.81, 95 % CI
      1.13-2.88; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.56), bloating (OR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.07-2.87; I (2) =
      0.00, p = 0.45) and overall symptoms (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.11-2.95; I (2) = 0.00, p
      = 0.4) in the RCTs. In the non-randomized interventions similar findings were
      observed. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis supports the efficacy of a low
      FODMAP diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Further
      research should ensure studies include dietary adherence, and more studies
      looking at greater number of patients and long-term adherence to a low FODMAP
      diet need to be conducted.

AB  - Functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome are commonly
      experienced within the population, and have an adverse impact on emotions,
      physical well-being, social activity, and occupational output. Adherence to a
      restricted diet can reduce symptoms, which in turn leads to increased quality of 
      life and well-being. The aim of this review was to assess the extent to which
      predictors of dietary adherence have been considered in studies relating to
      functional bowel disorders and following a restricted diet. This was done firstly
      by examining such studies which contained a measure or indicator of adherence,
      and then by examining predictors of adherence within and between studies. A
      search of PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was
      performed during July 2014, with the search criteria including relevant terms
      such as gastrointestinal disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, and adherence.
      Of an initial 7927 papers, 39 were suitable for inclusion. Fourteen of the 39
      studies included had a structured measure or indicator of dietary adherence, and 
      the remaining 25 mentioned adherence without any structured levels of adherence. 
      There was little investigation into the predictors of adherence, with symptom
      relief or induction being the primary goal of most of the studies. This review
      indicates that predictors of dietary adherence are rarely considered in research 
      regarding functional bowel disorders. Further investigation is needed into the
      variables which contribute to rates of adherence to restricted diets, and more
      rigorous research is needed to characterise those individuals most likely to be
      non-adherent. Such research is necessary to ensure that people with these
      conditions can be provided with appropriate support and interventions.

TI  - No Effects of a Short-Term Gluten-free Diet on Performance in Nonceliac Athletes.
PG  - 2563-70
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000699 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Implementation of gluten-free diets among nonceliac athletes has rapidly
      increased in recent years because of perceived ergogenic and health benefits. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on
      exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being,
      intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS:
      Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive
      clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome
      (mean +/- SD; age, 32 +/- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +/- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +/- 11.8 
      cm, VO2max 59.1 +/- 8.0 mL.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1)) were allocated to a 7-d
      gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, 
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either
      gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while
      habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet,
      cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI 
      questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a
      submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time
      trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to
      determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers 
      (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze
      data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between 
      the GCD (245.4 +/- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +/- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during
      exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There
      were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13)
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI
      symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory
      markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.

AB  - Regulation of gut motility is complex and involves neuromuscular, immune and
      environmental mechanisms. It is well established that patients with celiac
      disease (CD) often display gut dysmotility. Studies have shown the presence of
      disturbed esophageal motility, altered gastric emptying, and dysmotility of the
      small intestine, gallbladder and colon in untreated CD. Most of these motor
      abnormalities resolve after a strict gluten-free diet, suggesting that mechanisms
      related to the inflammatory condition and disease process are responsible for the
      motor dysfunction. Motility abnormalities are also a hallmark of functional bowel
      disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where it has been proposed as
      underlying mechanism for symptom generation (diarrhea, constipation, bloating).
      Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a poorly defined entity, mostly
      self-diagnosed, that presents clinically with IBS symptoms in the absence of
      specific celiac markers. Patients with NCGS are believed to react symptomatically
      to wheat components, and some studies have proposed the presence of low-grade
      inflammation in these patients. There is little information regarding the
      functional characterization of these patients before and after a gluten-free
      diet. A study suggested the presence of altered gastrointestinal transit in NCGS 
      patients who also have a high prevalence of nonspecific anti-gliadin antibodies. 
      Results of an ongoing clinical study in NCGS patients with positive anti-gliadin 
      antibodies before and after a gluten-free diet will be discussed. Elucidating the
      mechanisms for symptom generation in NCGS patients is important to find new
      therapeutic alternatives to the burden of imposing a strict gluten-free diet in
      patients who do not have CD.

LID - 10.1159/000369541 [doi]
AB  - Case finding for celiac disease (CD) is becoming increasingly common practice and
      is conducted in a wide range of clinical situations ranging from the presence of 
      gastrointestinal symptoms to failure to thrive in children, prolonged fatigue,
      unexpected weight loss and anemia. Case finding is also performed in associated
      conditions, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and type
      1 diabetes, as well as in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, unexplained
      neuropsychiatric disorders and first-degree relatives of patients with diagnosed 
      CD. This aggressive active case finding has dramatically changed the clinical
      characteristics of newly diagnosed patients. For instance, higher numbers of
      patients who present with extraintestinal symptoms are now being diagnosed with
      CD. Current recommendations state that due to a high risk for complications if
      the disease remains undiagnosed, patients with extraintestinal symptoms due to CD
      require appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Despite criticism regarding the
      cost-effectiveness of case finding in CD, such an aggressive approach has been
      considered cost-effective for high-risk patients. The diagnosis of CD among
      patients with extraintestinal symptoms requires a high degree of awareness of the
      clinical conditions that carry a high risk for underlying CD. Also, understanding
      the correct use of specific serology and duodenal histology is key for an
      appropriate diagnostic approach. Both procedures combined are able to confirm
      diagnosis in the vast majority of cases. However, in certain circumstances,
      serology and even duodenal histology cannot confirm or rule out CD. A common
      cause of negative IgA serology is IgA deficiency. For such eventuality, IgG-based
      serological tests can help confirm the diagnosis. Importantly, some
      histologically diagnosed cases still remain seronegative despite exclusion of IgA
      deficiency. On the other hand, duodenal histology may be normal despite the
      presence of CD-specific antibodies and active CD. This has been clearly
      demonstrated in some cases of untreated dermatitis herpetiformis, but may also be
      due to the patchy condition of CD or lesions that are not adequately recognized
      by nonexpert endoscopists and/or pathologists. The effectiveness of agluten-free 
      diet depends on the clinical end point addressed. A good example is the outcome
      of bone loss. While risk for fracture normalizes after the first year of dietary 
      treatment, bone parameters measured by densitometry may not be normalized in the 
      long-term follow-up. Moreover, it is still unclear how far an early gluten-free
      diet will positively affect associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes
      and autoimmune thyroiditis.

LID - V12140741 [pii]
AB  - The low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Monosaccharides and Polyoles) diet
      (LFD) allegedly reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Eleven
      studies have examined the effects of LFD on IBS. Most studies reported a
      symptomatic effect, but methodological weaknesses such as lack of relevant
      control group and of proper blinding means that a placebo response cannot be
      excluded. No studies have examined the effect of the important reintroduction
      phase nor the effects of LFD on IBS patients in primary care. Evidence suggests
      that intake of high dose FODMAP can induce gastrointestinal symptoms, but the
      clinical relevance of this is doubtful.

      based on pathophysiology.
PG  - 601-13
LID - 10.1007/s00535-015-1076-x [doi]
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common and distressing. They
      are so named because a defined pathophysiology in terms of structural or
      biochemical pathways is lacking. Traditionally FGIDs have been conceptualized as 
      brain-gut disorders, with subgroups of patients demonstrating visceral
      hypersensitivity and motility abnormalities as well as psychological distress.
      However, it is becoming apparent that there are certain structural or biochemical
      gut alterations among subsets with the common FGIDs, most notably functional
      dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). For example, a sodium channel 
      mutation has been identified in IBS that may account for 2 % of cases, and subtle
      intestinal inflammation has been observed in both IBS and FD. Other research has 
      implicated early life events and stress, autoimmune disorders and atopy and
      infections, the gut microbiome and disordered mucosal immune activation in
      patients with IBS or FD. Understanding the origin of symptoms in FGIDs will allow
      therapy to be targeted at the pathophysiological changes, not at merely
      alleviating symptoms, and holds hope for eventual cure in some cases. For
      example, there are promising developments in manipulating the microbiome through 
      diet, prebiotics and antibiotics in IBS, and testing and treating patients for
      Helicobacter pylori infection remains a mainstay of therapy in patients with
      dyspepsia and this infection. Locally acting drugs such as linaclotide have been 
      an advance in treating the symptoms of constipation-predominant IBS, but do not
      alter the natural history of the disease. A role for a holistic approach to
      patients with FGIDs is warranted, as brain-to-gut and gut-to-brain pathways
      appear to be activated.

LID - 10.1111/apt.13167 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fibre supplements have been advocated for the management of
      chronic constipation (CC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recently, a
      fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)
      restricted diet has been recommended for IBS. AIM: To systematically examine
      recent evidence for dietary interventions with fibre in CC and IBS and
      FODMAP-restricted diet in IBS, and provide recommendations. METHODS: We searched 
      PUBMED, MEDLINE, OVID and COCHRANE databases from 2004 to 2014. Published studies
      in adults with CC and IBS and constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) that compared 
      fibre with placebo/alternative and FODMAP-restricted diet with alternative were
      included. RESULTS: Of 550 potentially eligible clinical trials on fibre, 11
      studies were found and of 23 potentially eligible studies on FODMAPs, six were
      found. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity and methodological 
      quality. Fibre was beneficial in 5/7 studies in CC and 3/3 studies in IBS-C.
      FODMAP-restricted diet improved overall IBS symptoms in 4/4 and IBS-C symptoms in
      1/3 studies and three studies did not meet inclusion criteria. There were
      significant disparities in subject selection, interventions and outcome
      assessments in both fibre and FODMAPs studies. CONCLUSIONS: Fibre supplementation
      is beneficial in mild to moderate CC and IBS-C, although larger, more rigorous
      and long-term RCTs are needed (Fair evidence-Level II, Grade B). Although the
      FODMAP-restricted diet may be effective in short-term management of selected
      patients with IBS (Fair evidence-Level II, Grade C) and IBS-C (Poor
      evidence-Level III, Grade C), more rigorous trials are needed to establish
      long-term efficacy and safety, particularly on colonic health and microbiome.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that
      is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits 
      and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent
      developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of
      IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food
      allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new 
      diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that
      triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS
      appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a
      gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly
      absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and
      insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and
      insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and
      provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production,
      abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble
      fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. 
      Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the
      abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal
      endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake
      are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would
      expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain.
      However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual
      dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in
      combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for 
      IBS patients.

TI  - [Non-celiac gluten sensitivity].
PG  - 219-27
AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity has recently been recognized by the scientific
      community as a part of gluten-related disorders, and is defined as a condition
      with gastrointestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms triggered by gluten
      ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. Currently, there is
      no specific serological marker and non-celiac gluten sensitivity remains a
      diagnosis of exclusion: testing for celiac disease and wheat allergy must be
      negative, symptoms must improve with a gluten-free diet, and diagnosis must be
      confirmed by the gluten challenge. In this article, we discuss current knowledge 
      of pathophysiology, clinical and epidemilogical spectrum, diagnosis, and
      treatment of NCGS.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness and economic costs of group versus one-to-one education
      for short-chain fermentable carbohydrate restriction (low FODMAP diet) in the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 687-96
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restriction of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) is an effective dietary treatment for
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patient dietary education is essential but labour
      intensive. Group FODMAP education may alleviate this somewhat but has not
      previously been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical
      effectiveness of low FODMAP group education in patients with IBS and to explore
      the cost of a group pathway. METHODS: Patients with IBS (n = 364) were assessed
      for their suitability to attend dietitian-led group education or traditional
      one-to-one education in a novel group pathway. Clinical effectiveness (global
      symptom question, symptom prevalence, stool output) were compared at baseline and
      follow-up using the chi-squared test. The costs of the novel group pathway were
      assessed using a decision model. RESULTS: The global symptom question indicated
      more patients were satisfied with their symptoms following dietary advice, in
      both group education [baseline 48/263 (18%) versus follow-up 142/263 (54%), P <
      0.001] and one-to-one education [baseline 5/101 (5%) versus follow-up 61/101
      (60%), P < 0.001], with no difference between group and one-to-one education at
      follow-up (P = 0.271). Overall, there was a significant decrease in symptom
      severity from baseline to follow-up (P < 0.001 for both groups) but no difference
      in symptom response between group and one-to-one education. The cost for the
      group education pathway for all 364 patients was pound31 713.36. CONCLUSIONS: The
      present study shows that dietitian-led FODMAP group education is clinically
      effective and the costs associated with a FODMAP group pathway are worthy of
      further consideration for routine clinical care.

LID - 10.17116/terarkh201587220-23 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To establish the rate of lactase deficiency (LD) in patients with
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), to define a role of enteric
      bacteria in the pathogenesis of hypolactasia, and to evaluate the efficiency of
      probiotic therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Examinations were made in 386 patients
      with PI-IBS, including 112 (79.4%) women; mean age 33.9 +/- 9.1 years; disease
      duration 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. Rapid tests of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) biopsy
      specimens obtained from the duodenal retrobulbar segment were used to diagnose
      LD. Bacterial growth was estimated by a hydrogen breath test using a H2 MICRO gas
      analyzer. RESULTS: The patients with PI-IBS were revealed to have moderate and
      severe LD in 25.6 and 10.9%, respectively. All the patients with LD were detected
      to have small intestinal (SI) bacterial overgrowth (BOG). An inverse correlation 
      was found between LD and the degree of SI BOG (r = -0.53; p < 0.001). 73.7% of
      the patients with moderate LD showed a positive effect of probiotic therapy as
      regression of clinical symptoms of LD, a decrease of hydrogen levels in expired
      air from 72.4 +/- 25.1 to 16.41 +/- 3.2 ppm (p < 0.05), an increase of lactate
      activity in the SIM biopsy specimens and an improvement of quality of life from
      2.69 +/- 0.53 to 5.53 +/- 0.64 scores according to the GCI scale. No improvement 
      occurred in 73.8% of the patients with severe LD. CONCLUSION: LD was identified
      in 36.5% of the patients with PI-IBS. There was an inverse correlation between
      the degree of LD and SI BOG. The good therapeutic effect of probiotics in LD
      suggests that the symbiotic gut microflora positively affects the activity of
      lactase in the human SIM. No therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with
      severe LN serves as the basis for a search for more active probiotic therapy.

TI  - The Intestinal Gas Questionnaire: development of a new instrument for measuring
      gas-related symptoms and their impact on daily life.
PG  - 885-98
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12565 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although gas-related symptoms (GRS) are common and intrusive, there
      are no questionnaires to quantitate this problem. This study aimed to develop an 
      instrument to rectify this gap in our knowledge. METHODS: Concepts were initially
      identified from the literature and interviews with gastroenterologists.
      Exploratory one-to-one interviews and focus groups with irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS) patients (n = 28) and non-IBS subjects (n = 27) with GRS were conducted in 
      UK, France, and Spain leading to a conceptual framework for the questionnaire.
      Last, iterative rounds of cognitive debriefing were performed with IBS (n = 16)
      and non-IBS subjects (n = 14). KEY RESULTS: From the first three steps, nine GRS 
      (bloating, distension, flatulence, odorous flatulence, difficult gas evacuation, 
      stomach rumbling, belching, bad breath, and abdominal movement) were identified
      although abdominal movement was subsequently excluded. Twelve quality of life
      domains affected by these symptoms were identified as: Clothing, emotional,
      physical appearance, diet, daily living, work, social life, physical activity,
      relationships, sex life, sleep, and cognitive function. A 24-h recall for
      symptoms and a 7-day recall for impact assessment were supported by the
      qualitative findings. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the understanding of the
      instrument. Across the three languages, the instrument was conceptually and
      linguistically consistent. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The International Gas
      Questionnaire is a 2-part instrument, developed rigorously and simultaneously in 
      three languages assessing seven symptoms (17 items) and their impact on 12
      domains (26 items) in IBS and general population. It is now undergoing
      psychometric validation and should provide a unique tool for epidemiological
      surveys and clinical trials for developing new treatments for these symptoms.

TI  - Partially hydrolyzed guar gum in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with
      constipation: effects of gender, age, and body mass index.
PG  - 104-10
LID - 10.4103/1319-3767.153835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) relieves symptoms in
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and may have prebiotic
      properties. However, the correlation between the effectiveness of PHGG and
      patient characteristics has not been examined. We aimed to investigate the effect
      of PHGG in symptom relief on constipation-predominant IBS according to gender,
      age, and body mass index (BMI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with
      IBS entered a 2-week run-in period, followed by a 4-week study period with PHGG. 
      Patients completed a daily questionnaire to assess the presence of abdominal
      pain/discomfort, swelling, and the sensation of incomplete evacuation. The number
      of evacuations/day, the daily need for laxatives/enemas and stool
      consistency-form were also evaluated. All patients also underwent a colonic
      transit time (CTT) evaluation. RESULTS: PHGG administration was associated with a
      significant improvement in symptom scores, use of laxatives/enemas, stool
      form/consistency and CTT. At the end of the study period and compared with
      baseline, the number of evacuations improved in women, patients aged >/= 45 years
      and those with BMI >/= 25 (P < 0.05 for all comparisons); abdominal bloating
      improved in males (P < 0.05), patients < 45 years (P < 0.01) and those with BMI <
      25 (P < 0.05). A decrease in the number of perceived incomplete evacuations/day
      was reported in patients with a BMI >/= 25 (P < 0.05). Reductions in
      laxative/enema use were recorded in females (P < 0.05), patients < 45 years (P < 
      0.01), and patients with BMI < 25 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gender, age, and BMI
      seem to influence the effect of PHGG supplementation in constipated IBS patients.
      Further studies are needed to clarify the interaction of such parameters with a
      fiber-enriched diet.

AB  - Wheat-related disorders have become a growing area of clinical and scientific
      interest and can be categorized broadly as: autoimmune-mediated; allergic; and
      non-autoimmune/non-allergic conditions. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and 
      non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) present on this spectrum as disorders
      associated with adverse gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations
      following exposure to gluten and/or other wheat-related constituents. NCGS/NCWS
      is increasingly considered in patients with unexplained symptoms after the
      exclusions of celiac disease and wheat allergy. As objective diagnostic data and 
      specific biomarkers are lacking, response to a gluten-free/wheat-free diet can
      confirm the presence of NCGS/NCWS. An association with irritable bowel syndrome
      has been detected, and the effects of other food components, such as fermentable 
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, may contribute.
      Our organization and synthesis of extant knowledge pertaining to wheat-related
      disorders may advance current practice and research efforts toward an improved
      understanding of NCGS/NCWS as an evolving clinical entity.

      immunoglobulin.
PG  - 3361-6

AB  - Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are 
      also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical
      practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been
      shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as
      well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients 
      with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency
      virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS
      patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual
      physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7
      IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; 
      also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87
      years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard
      care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with
      the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of
      improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the
      prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two
      patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of
      insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall
      improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as
      well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In 
      most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of
      therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted 
      mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein
      source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and
      nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal
      epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with 
      IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.

TI  - Fibromyalgia and nutrition: what news?
PG  - S117-25
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic, generalised pain condition usually
      accompanied by several associated symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance,
      headache, irritable bowel syndrome and mood disorders. Different medical
      treatments are used to treat fibromyalgia and the recent guidelines suggest that 
      the optimal treatment consists in a multidisciplinary approach with a combination
      of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. Among
      non-pharmacological treatment, nutrition is a promising tool for FM patients. The
      aim of this review is to update the present knowledge about fibromyalgia and
      nutrition by means of a systematic search performed on Medline from January 2000 
      to December 2014. Nutritional deficiencies have been described in FM patients and
      the benefits of specific diet and nutritional supplementation are shown. Obesity 
      and overweight, often present in FM patients, are related to the severity of FM
      worsening the quality of life in terms of higher pain, fatigue, worsened sleep
      quality and higher incidence of mood disorders. Weight control is thus an
      effective tool to improve the symptoms. Moreover, it seems reasonable to
      eliminate some foods from the diet of FM patients, for example excitotoxins.
      Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is increasingly recognised as a frequent condition
      with similar manifestations which overlap with those of FM. The elimination of
      gluten from the diet of FM patients is recently becoming a potential dietary
      intervention for clinical improvement. In summary, this review reveals the
      potential benefit of specific dietary interventions as non-pharmacological tools 
      as part of a multidisciplinary treatment for FM patients.

TI  - Staple foods consumption and irritable bowel syndrome in Japanese adults: a
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - e0119097
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119097 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbohydrates can cause gastrointestinal symptoms due to incomplete
      absorption in the small bowel. Thus, high-carbohydrate diets may induce symptoms 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVE: This observational and
      cross-sectional study assessed the association between consumption of several
      carbohydrate-enriched staple foods, such as rice, Japanese wheat noodles, Chinese
      noodles, bread, pasta, and buckwheat noodles, and the prevalence of IBS in
      Japanese adults. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One thousand and eighty-two (837 men)
      Japanese adult employees aged 19-85 were included in this cross-sectional study
      conducted in 2011. IBS diagnosis was based on the Rome III criteria. Consumption 
      of staple foods was assessed using a brief self-administered diet history
      questionnaire, and divided into three categories (low, middle, high) depending on
      their distribution. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, daily consumption of
      rice (odds ratios [ORs] and [95% confidence interval (CI)]: middle, 1.36
      [0.93-1.99]; high, 1.67 [1.12-2.49]; P for trend = 0.01), bread (middle, 1.88
      [1.28-2.75]; high, 1.63 [1.10-2.41]; P for trend = 0.01), pasta (middle, 1.47
      [1.01-2.15]; high, 1.68 [1.12-2.52]; P for trend = 0.01), and buckwheat noodles
      (middle, 1.76 [1.18-2.61]; high, 1.98 [1.31-3.00]; P for trend = 0.001) were
      associated with higher prevalence of IBS after adjustment for socio-demographic, 
      anthropometric, and lifestyle-related factors. Buckwheat noodles, but not other
      staple foods, retained an association with the prevalence of IBS even after
      adjustment for daily intake of carbohydrates or plant proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This
      cross-sectional study demonstrated that the consumption of staple foods, such as 
      rice, bread, pasta, and buckwheat noodles is associated with the prevalence of
      IBS. Of these, the consumption of buckwheat noodles, but not other staple foods, 
      is associated with IBS independent of carbohydrate or plant protein contents.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder that is
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or
      diarrhea. The diagnosis can be made using Rome III criteria or published
      guidelines after taking a thoughtful history, excluding warning signs, and
      performing a careful physical examination. Limited testing (ie, complete blood
      count and C-reactive protein level) may be useful in appropriate patients. A
      number of pharmacologic options are available, although many patients fail to
      respond to pharmacologic therapy. Although several IBS diets frequently are
      recommended, data supporting their use are limited. This article provides a
      rationale as to why specific diets might improve IBS symptoms and evaluates
      published trials.

TI  - Systematic review: noncoeliac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 807-20
LID - 10.1111/apt.13155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a controversial emerging
      disorder. Despite reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten, NCGS
      remains a diagnosis based on the exclusion of coeliac disease, given the absence 
      of reliable biomarkers. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence, diagnostic exclusion of 
      coeliac disease and the efficacy of a gluten-free diet (GFD) for NCGS patients.
      METHODS: A PubMed search was performed up to December 2014. According to
      consensus diagnostic criteria, NCGS was defined as self-reported gluten
      intolerance, negative coeliac serology and absence of villous atrophy. Studies
      evaluating the impact of a GFD on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      were also included. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of NCGS (0.5-13%) differed widely. 
      Seventeen studies, including 1561 patients (26 children), met the inclusion
      criteria for NCGS. HLA haplotypes could not be linked to histology [normal or
      lymphocytic enteritis (LE)] in 1123 NCGS patients. HLADQ2/DQ8 haplotypes were
      present in 44% of NCGS patients. After advanced diagnostic techniques in 189 NCGS
      patients combining LE and HLADQ2/DQ8 haplotypes, 39 (20%) were reclassified as
      coeliac disease. There was a higher than expected family history of coeliac
      disease and autoimmune disorders in NCGS patients. A GFD resulted in variable
      results for variable, but significantly improved stool frequency in HLADQ2
      positive diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates for
      NCGS are extremely variable. A subset of NCGS patients might belong in the
      so-called 'coeliac-lite' disease. The benefit of a GFD for NCGS patients is
      currently controversial. HLADQ2 positive diarrhoea-type IBS patients might gain
      symptom improvement from a GFD.

TI  - Therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus in treating irritable bowel syndrome: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 243-9
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.2710 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As the lack of reliable treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      prompts interest in the development of new therapies, we aimed to systematically 
      evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus in treating this disease. METHODS: We
      searched MEDLIINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials for the period from 1966 to August 2013 for
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of
      Lactobacillus treatment in the management of IBS. The studies were screened for
      inclusion based on randomization, controls and reported measurable outcomes. We
      used the Jadad score to assess the quality of the articles. The STATA 11.0 and
      Revman 5.0 software packages were used for the meta-analysis. The STATA 11.0
      software program was also used to assess indicators of publication bias according
      to Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: Six randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
      trials met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The Jadad score
      of the articles was >3, and three articles were of high quality. We analyzed the 
      heterogeneity of the studies and found no heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In 
      the forest plot, the diamond was on the right side of the vertical line and did
      not intersect with the line. The pooled relative risk for clinical improvement
      with Lactobacillus treatment was 7.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.33-25.43,
      p=0.0008). For adults, the pooled relative risk for clinical improvement with
      Lactobacillus treatment was 17.62 (95% confidence interval: 5.12-60.65,
      p<0.00001). For children, the pooled relative risk for clinical improvement with 
      Lactobacillus treatment was 3.71 (95% confidence interval:1.05-13.11, p=0.04).
      Using the STATA 10.0 and Revman 5.0 software programs, we confirmed that
      Lactobacillus exhibited significant efficacy in treating IBS. CONCLUSION:
      Compared with the placebo, Lactobacillus treatment was found to be associated
      with a significantly higher rate of treatment responders in the overall
      population with IBS, without any side effects. As to limitations of the analysis,
      additional research is needed.

TI  - Evaluation of the probiotic properties of new Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
      strains and their in vitro effect.
PG  - 5613-26
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6482-8 [doi]
AB  - Probiotic ingestion is recommended as a preventive approach to maintain the
      balance of the intestinal microbiota and to enhance the human well-being. During 
      the whole life of each individual, the gut microbiota composition could be
      altered by lifestyle, diet, antibiotic therapies and other stress conditions,
      which may lead to acute and chronic disorders. Hence, probiotics can be
      administered for the prevention or treatment of some disorders, including lactose
      malabsorption, acute diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing
      enterocolitis and mild forms of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      probiotic-mediated effect is an important issue that needs to be addressed in
      relation to strain-specific probiotic properties. In this work, the probiotic
      properties of new Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were screened, and
      their effects in vitro were evaluated. They were screened for probiotic
      properties by determining their tolerance to low pH and to bile salts, antibiotic
      sensitivity, antimicrobial activity and vitamin B8, B9 and B12 production, and by
      considering their ability to increase the antioxidant potential and to modulate
      the inflammatory status of systemic-miming cell lines in vitro. Three out of the 
      examined strains presenting the most performant probiotic properties, as
      Lactobacillus plantarum PBS067, Lactobacillus rhamnosus PBS070 and
      Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis PBSO75, were evaluated for their effects
      also on human intestinal HT-29 cell line. The obtained results support the
      possibility to move to another level of study, that is, the oral administration
      of these probiotical strains to patients with acute and chronic gut disorders, by
      in vivo experiments.

PG  - 949-58
LID - 10.1001/jama.2015.0954 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 7% to 21% of the general
      population. It is a chronic condition that can substantially reduce quality of
      life and work productivity. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing evidence on
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of IBS and to provide practical
      treatment recommendations for generalists and specialists according to the best
      available evidence. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A search of Ovid (MEDLINE) and Cochrane
      Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for literature from 2000 to December
      2014 for the terms pathophysiology, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, irritable 
      bowel syndrome, and IBS. The range was expanded from 1946 to December 2014 for
      IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, treatment, and therapy. FINDINGS: The
      database search yielded 1303 articles, of which 139 were selected for inclusion. 
      IBS is not a single disease but rather a symptom cluster resulting from diverse
      pathologies. Factors important to the development of IBS include alterations in
      the gut microbiome, intestinal permeability, gut immune function, motility,
      visceral sensation, brain-gut interactions, and psychosocial status. The
      diagnosis of IBS relies on symptom-based criteria, exclusion of concerning
      features (symptom onset after age 50 years, unexplained weight loss, family
      history of selected organic gastrointestinal diseases, evidence of
      gastrointestinal blood loss, and unexplained iron-deficiency anemia), and the
      performance of selected tests (complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein or
      fecal calprotectin, serologic testing for celiac disease, and age-appropriate
      colorectal cancer screening) to exclude organic diseases that can mimic IBS.
      Determining the predominant symptom (IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation, or
      mixed IBS) plays an important role in selection of diagnostic tests and
      treatments. Various dietary, lifestyle, medical, and behavioral interventions
      have proven effective in randomized clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      The diagnosis of IBS relies on the identification of characteristic symptoms and 
      the exclusion of other organic diseases. Management of patients with IBS is
      optimized by an individualized, holistic approach that embraces dietary,
      lifestyle, medical, and behavioral interventions.

TI  - A study evaluating the bidirectional relationship between inflammatory bowel
      disease and self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 847-53
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the associated use of a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) are perceived to belong to the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). However, recent reports suggest substantial use of a GFD in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). We assessed the bidirectional relationship between IBD and
      self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity (SR-NCGS). METHODS: A cross-sectional
      questionnaire screened for SR-NCGS and the use of a GFD in 4 groups: ulcerative
      colitis (n = 75), Crohn's disease (n = 70), IBS (n = 59), and dyspeptic controls 
      (n = 109). We also assessed diagnostic outcomes for IBD in 200 patients
      presenting with SR-NCGS. RESULTS: The prevalence of SR-NCGS was 42.4% (n = 25/59)
      for IBS, followed by 27.6% (n = 40/145) for IBD, and least among dyspeptic
      controls at 17.4% (n = 19/109); P = 0.015. The current use of a GFD was 11.9% (n 
      = 7/59) for IBS, 6.2% (n = 9/145) for IBD, and 0.9% (1/109) for dyspeptic
      controls; P = 0.02. No differences were established between ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. However, Crohn's disease patients with SR-NCGS were
      significantly more likely to have stricturing disease (40.9% versus 18.9%, P =
      0.046), and higher mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (228.1 versus 133.3,
      P = 0.002), than those without SR-NCGS. Analysis of 200 cases presenting with
      SR-NCGS suggested that 98.5% (n = 197) could be dietary-related IBS. However,
      1.5% (n = 3) were found to have IBD; such patients had associated alarm symptoms,
      and/or abnormal blood parameters, prompting colonic investigations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      SR-NCGS is not only exclusive to IBS but also associated with IBD, where its
      presence may be reflecting severe or stricturing disease. Randomized studies are 
      required to further delineate the nature of this relationship and clarify whether
      a GFD is a valuable dietetic intervention in selected IBD patients.

TI  - Role of FODMAPs in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 665-82
LID - 10.1177/0884533615569886 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition characterized by abdominal pain,
      bloating, flatus, and altered bowel habits. The role of dietary components in
      inducing IBS symptoms is difficult to explore. To date, foods are not considered 
      a cause but rather symptom-triggering factors. Particular interest has been given
      to the so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and
      polyols). We aimed to summarize the evidence from the most common approaches to
      manage suspected food intolerance in IBS, with a particular interest in the role 
      of FODMAPs and the effects of a low FODMAP diet. We reviewed literature,
      consulting PubMed and Medline by using the search terms FODMAP(s), fructose,
      lactose, fructans, galactans, polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol,
      erythritol, polydextrose, and isomalt), irritable bowel syndrome, and functional 
      gastrointestinal symptoms. FODMAP-restricted diets have been used for a long time
      to manage patients with IBS. The innovation in the so-called FODMAP concept is
      that a global restriction should have a more consistent effect than a limited one
      in preventing abdominal distension. Even though all the potential low FODMAP
      diets provide good relief of symptoms in many patients, there is just a little
      relief in others. Several studies highlight the role of low FODMAP diets to
      improve symptoms in patients with IBS. The evidence on this dietary approach
      supports the hypothesis that a low FODMAP diet should be the first dietary
      approach. However, many points remain to be clarified, including the evaluation
      of possibly significant nutrition concerns.

PG  - 926-38
LID - 10.1172/JCI76304 [doi]
LID - 76304 [pii]
AB  - Tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the bidirectional
      interactions between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and 
      the gastrointestinal tract. A series of provocative preclinical studies have
      suggested a prominent role for the gut microbiota in these gut-brain
      interactions. Based on studies using rodents raised in a germ-free environment,
      the gut microbiota appears to influence the development of emotional behavior,
      stress- and pain-modulation systems, and brain neurotransmitter systems.
      Additionally, microbiota perturbations by probiotics and antibiotics exert
      modulatory effects on some of these measures in adult animals. Current evidence
      suggests that multiple mechanisms, including endocrine and neurocrine pathways,
      may be involved in gut microbiota-to-brain signaling and that the brain can in
      turn alter microbial composition and behavior via the autonomic nervous system.
      Limited information is available on how these findings may translate to healthy
      humans or to disease states involving the brain or the gut/brain axis. Future
      research needs to focus on confirming that the rodent findings are translatable
      to human physiology and to diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, autism,
      anxiety, depression, and Parkinson's disease.

TI  - The rise and fall of gluten!
PG  - 221-6
LID - 10.1017/S0029665115000038 [doi]
AB  - Mankind has existed for 2.5 million years but only in the last 10,000 years have 
      we been exposed to wheat. Wheat was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent
      (South Western Asia) with a farming expansion that lasted from about 9000BC to
      4000BC. Thus it could be considered that wheat (and gluten) is a novel
      introduction to man's diet! Prior to 1939 the rationing system had already been
      devised. This led to an imperative to try to increase agricultural production.
      Thus it was agreed in 1941 that there was a need to establish a Nutrition
      Society. The very roots of the society were geared towards necessarily increasing
      the production of wheat. This goal was achieved and by the end of the 20th
      century, global wheat output had expanded 5-fold. Perhaps as a result the
      epidemiology of coeliac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy has changed.
      CD is a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in
      genetically susceptible individuals. CD now affects 1 % or more of all adults,
      for which the treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, there is 
      a growing body of evidence to show that a far greater proportion of individuals
      without coeliac disease are taking a gluten-free diet of their own volition. This
      clinical entity has been termed non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although
      the condition is fraught with complexities due to overlap with other gluten-based
      constituents that can also trigger similar clinical symptoms. This review will
      explore the relationship between gluten, the rising prevalence of modern coeliac 
      disease, and the new entity of NCGS along with its associated uncertainties.

AB  - Ingestion of food has long been linked with gut symptoms, and there is increasing
      interest in using diet in the management of patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). The West has developed an intense interest in specialized,
      restrictive diets, such as those that target multiple food groups, avoid gluten, 
      or reduce fermentable oligo-, di-, and mono-saccharides and polyols. However,
      most gastroenterologists are not well educated about diets or their effects on
      the gut. It is important to understand the various dietary approaches, their
      putative mechanisms, the evidence that supports their use, and the benefits or
      harm they might produce. The concepts behind, and delivery of, specialized diets 
      differ from those of pharmacologic agents. High-quality research is needed to
      determine the efficacy of different dietary approaches and the place of specific 
      strategies.

TI  - Nonpharmacologic treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 522-35
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-2123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Various nonpharmacologic treatments are available for
      pediatric abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (AP-FGIDs). Data on efficacy and safety are scarce. The goal of this study was to
      summarize the evidence regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric
      AP-FGIDs: lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, behavioral
      interventions, prebiotics and probiotics, and alternative medicine. METHODS:
      Searches were conducted of the Medline and Cochrane Library databases. Systematic
      reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning nonpharmacologic
      therapies in children (aged 3-18 years) with AP-FGIDs were included, and data
      were extracted on participants, interventions, and outcomes. The quality of
      evidence was assessed by using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs were
      found that included 1390 children. Significant improvement of abdominal pain was 
      reported after hypnotherapy compared with standard care/wait-list approaches and 
      after cognitive behavioral therapy compared with a variety of control
      treatments/wait-list approaches. Written self-disclosure improved pain frequency 
      at the 6-month follow-up only. Compared with placebo, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG 
      (LGG) and VSL#3 were associated with significantly more treatment responders (LGG
      relative risk: 1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.59]; VSL#3: P < .05).
      Guar gum significantly improved irritable bowel syndrome symptom frequency;
      however, no effect was found for other fiber supplements (relative risk: 1.17
      [95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.81]) or a lactose-free diet. Functional
      disability was not significantly decreased after yoga compared with a wait-list
      approach. No studies were found concerning lifestyle interventions; gluten-,
      histamine-, or carbonic acid-free diets; fluid intake; or prebiotics. No serious 
      adverse effects were reported. The quality of evidence was found to be very low
      to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Although high-quality studies are lacking, some
      evidence shows efficacy of hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
      probiotics (LGG and VSL#3) in pediatric AP-FGIDs. Data on fiber supplements are
      inconclusive.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena?
PG  - 278-87
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.427 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous functional disorder with a
      multifactorial etiology that involves the interplay of both host and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors relevant for IBS etiology, the
      diet stands out given that the majority of IBS patients report their symptoms to 
      be triggered by meals or specific foods. The diet provides substrates for
      microbial fermentation, and, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is
      disturbed in IBS patients, the link between diet, microbiota composition, and
      microbial fermentation products might have an essential role in IBS etiology. In 
      this review, we summarize current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the
      intestinal microbiota on IBS symptoms, as well as the reported interactions
      between diet and the microbiota composition. On the basis of the existing data,
      we suggest pathways (mechanisms) by which diet components, via the microbial
      fermentation, could trigger IBS symptoms. Finally, this review provides
      recommendations for future studies that would enable elucidation of the role of
      diet and microbiota and how these factors may be (inter)related in the
      pathophysiology of IBS.

AB  - PURPOSE: of review Those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have long
      reported the frequent precipitation of their symptoms in relation to food
      ingestion and have often been convinced that certain foods were especially
      problematic. However, until very recently, research on the responses to food or
      individual dietary constituents, in IBS, has been scarce. This review addresses
      recent literature on diet and IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: The complexity of
      food-symptom interactions in IBS is being revealed in recent and ongoing
      research. Such studies have revealed the variable effects of fibre in IBS and the
      susceptibility of IBS individuals to the ingestion of poorly digested and
      absorbed carbohydrates. The latter has led to the widespread adoption of the
      low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols
      (FODMAPs) diet. Less certain is the role of another widely adopted dietary
      strategy, gluten restriction. Diet-microbe interactions are critical to the
      homeostasis of the gut microbiome in health and may well be disturbed in disease;
      enthusiasm continues, therefore, for the use of probiotics in IBS. SUMMARY: Food 
      is a common precipitant of symptoms in IBS and recent research has focused on the
      role(s) of individual dietary constituents in IBS and on fibre, FODMAPs, gluten
      and probiotics, in particular. Each may have a role in certain IBS sufferers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Food is a recognized trigger for most patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). In recent years, an emerging evidence base has identified dietary
      manipulation as an important therapeutic approach in IBS. SOURCES OF DATA:
      Original and review articles were identified through selective searches performed
      on PubMed and Google Scholar. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Randomized controlled trials
      have supported the use of a diet that restricts a group of short-chain
      carbohydrates known collectively as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, 
      monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). There is evidence that specific probiotics
      may improve symptoms in IBS. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The role of a high-fibre diet 
      remains subject to ongoing debate with a lack of high-quality evidence. The
      long-term durability and safety of a low FODMAP diet are unclear. GROWING POINTS:
      A paradigm shift has led to a focus on the relationship between diet and
      pathophysiological mechanisms in IBS such as effects on intestinal microbiota,
      inflammation, motility, permeability and visceral hypersensitivity. AREAS TIMELY 
      FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Future large, randomized controlled trials with rigorous
      end points are required. In addition, predictors of response need to be
      identified to offer personalized therapy.

AB  - During the past decade there has been an impressive increase in popularity of the
      gluten-free diet (GFD)-now the most trendy alimentary habit in the United States 
      and other countries. According to recent surveys, as many as 100 million
      Americans will consume gluten-free products within a year. Operating under the
      concept that the GFD benefits only individuals with celiac disease, health care
      professionals have struggled to separate the wheat from the chaff; there are
      claims that eliminating gluten from the diet increases health and helps with
      weight loss, or even that gluten can be harmful to every human being. However,
      apart from unfounded trends, a disorder related to ingestion of gluten or
      gluten-containing cereals, namely nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), has
      resurfaced in the literature, fueling a debate on the appropriateness of the GFD 
      for people without celiac disease. Although there is clearly a fad component to
      the popularity of the GFD, there is also undisputable and increasing evidence for
      NCGS. However, we require a better understanding of the clinical presentation of 
      NCGS, as well as its pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and role in
      conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, and autoimmunity.
      Before we can begin to identify and manage NCGS, there must be agreement on the
      nomenclature and definition of the disorder based on proper peer-reviewed
      scientific information. We review the most recent findings on NCGS and outline
      directions to dissipate some of the confusion related to this disorder.

      constipation: a comparative controlled study].
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal
      disorder associated with decrease in quality of life and a high social cost. Diet
      is one of several therapeutic options in IBS treatment; therefore the development
      and clinical evaluation of innovative functional food for IBS patients is useful.
      Dry jelly concentrate containing 3 g inulin, 10 mg curcumin and 1.8 mg of
      pyridoxine was developed and clinically evaluated. Fifty patients fulfilling the 
      Rome III criteria for IBS-C were randomly assigned into two groups: one received 
      standard diet plus two jelly drinks a day for 2 weeks and control group received 
      standard diet. Response to therapy was recorded on a daily basis using Likert
      scale of abdominal pain, bloating and feeling of incomplete bowel emptying,
      frequency of bowel movement, Bristol stool scale, and quality of life assessed by
      IBSQoL questionnaire before and after the treatment. Intake of functional food
      product (jelly) containing inulin and curcumin is associated with a significant
      positive effect on the stool parameters (from 0.6+/-0.24 to 1.15+/-0.65 t/d in
      stool frequency, p=0.001, from 2.62+/-1.23 to 3.99+/-1.27, index Bristol scale,
      p=0.001), a reduce of the severity of abdominal pain (from 1.69+/-0.71 to
      1.36+/-0.44 Likert scale points, p=0.001), bloating (from 2.03+/-0.89 to
      1.55+/-0.81 points of Likert scale, p=0.02) and a sense of incomplete bowel
      emptying (from 2.25+/-0.98 to 1.68+/-0.92 points of Likert scale, p=0.001), as
      well as an increase in quality of life (from 64.5+/-13.5 to 81.2+/-9.1%, small
      er, Cyrillic=0.05). Patients in control group have improvement in abdominal pain 
      (from 2.16+/-0.58 to 1.8+/-0.61 Likert scale points, p=0.05) and bloating (from
      2.42+/-0.83 to 2.16+/-0.71 Likert scale points, p=0.05) only. During the
      treatment period no significant adverse events were found. These results indicate
      that jelly concentrate containing inulin, curcumin and pyridoxine improves
      abdominal pain score, Bristol scale index and quality of life in patients with
      IBS-C.

AB  - New strategies for the care of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are developing and 
      several novel treatments have been globally produced. New methods of care should 
      be customized geographically because each country has a specific medical system, 
      life style, eating habit, gut microbiota, genes and so on. Several clinical
      guidelines for IBS have been proposed and the Japanese Society of
      Gastroenterology (JSGE) subsequently developed evidence-based clinical practice
      guidelines for IBS. Sixty-two clinical questions (CQs) comprising 1 definition, 6
      epidemiology, 6 pathophysiology, 10 diagnosis, 30 treatment, 4 prognosis, and 5
      complications were proposed and statements were made to answer to CQs. A
      diagnosis algorithm and a three-step treatment was provided for patients with
      chronic abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort and/or abnormal bowel movement. If
      more than one alarm symptom/sign, risk factor and/or routine examination is
      positive, colonoscopy is indicated. If all of them, or the subsequent
      colonoscopy, are/is negative, Rome III or compatible criteria is applied. After
      IBS diagnosis, step 1 therapy consisting of diet therapy, behavioral modification
      and gut-targeted pharmacotherapy is indicated for four weeks. Non-responders to
      step 1 therapy proceed to the second step that includes psychopharmacological
      agents and simple psychotherapy for four weeks. In the third step, for patients
      non-responsive to step 2 therapy, a combination of gut-targeted pharmacotherapy, 
      psychopharmacological treatments and/or specific psychotherapy is/are indicated. 
      Clinical guidelines and consensus for IBS treatment in Japan are well suited for 
      Japanese IBS patients; as such, they may provide useful insight for IBS treatment
      in other countries around the world.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Successful treatment of patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) often remains elusive. Recent studies in Australia, the United
      Kingdom and New Zealand have suggested the efficacy of a diet low in fermentable 
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in the
      management of these patients. The aims of this study were to determine whether a 
      diet low in FODMAPs improves symptoms in patients with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in Spain and to analyze the predictors of a
      good response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
      consecutive patients with FGID type IBS and functioanl abdominal bloating. At
      inclusion all patients underwent an assessment through a baseline demographic
      questionnaire of symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life. A
      hydrogen breath test with lactose and fructose was performed and a low FODMAPs
      diet was indicated for 2 months by expert dietitians. These tests were taken as a
      reference. A positive response was defined as an improvement of at least 5 points
      out of a possible 10 in the symptom questionnaire. RESULTS: We included 30
      patients (24 women, 39 [12] years). The response to the low FODMAPs diet was
      positive in controlling overall symptoms and specific symptoms such as functioanl
      abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and fatigue in
      more than 70% of patients (P<.05). By contrast, constipation was controlled in
      only 48% of patients (P>.05). Adherence to the diet was good in 87% of patients
      and was a predictor of positive response in the univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      A diet low in FODMAPs is associated with symptom improvement in patients with IBS
      and functioanl abdominal bloating. Adherence to the diet was a determining
      factor.

PG  - 1169-77
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3436-4 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease, which
      adversely affects the quality of life. Its prevalence has been reported to be
      around 10-15 % in North America and constitutes the most common cause for
      gastroenterology referral. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of IBS is not
      completely understood. Not surprisingly, the management strategies can leave the 
      patients with inadequate symptom control, making IBS a debilitating
      gastrointestinal syndrome. Dietary interventions as a treatment strategy for IBS 
      have been recently evaluated. One such intervention includes dietary restriction 
      of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs
      define a group of short-chain carbohydrates that are incompletely absorbed in
      small intestine and later fermented in the colon. Evidence in the form of
      randomized controlled trials and observational studies have evaluated the
      mechanism of action and efficacy of low-FODMAP diet. This dietary intervention
      has showed promising results in symptom reduction in IBS patients. However,
      latest trials have also shown that the low-FODMAP diet is associated with marked 
      changes in gut microbiota specifically reduction in microbiota with prebiotic
      properties. Implications of such changes on gastrointestinal health need to be
      further evaluated in future trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence concerning disordered eating practices
      in dietary-controlled gastrointestinal conditions. Three key questions were
      examined: a) are disordered eating practices a feature of GI disorders?; b) what 
      abnormal eating practices are present in those with GI disorders?; and c) what
      factors are associated with the presence of disordered eating in those with GI
      disorders? By exploring these questions, we aim to develop a conceptual model of 
      disordered eating development in GI disease. METHODS: Five key databases, Web of 
      Science with Conference Proceedings (1900-2014) and MEDLINE (1950-2014), PubMed, 
      PsycINFO (1967-2014) and Google Scholar, were searched for papers relating to
      disordered eating practices in those with GI disorders. All papers were quality
      assessed before being included in the review. RESULTS: Nine papers were included 
      in the review. The majority of papers reported that the prevalence of disordered 
      eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations
      of healthy controls. Disordered eating patterns in dietary-controlled GI
      disorders may be associated with both anxiety and GI symptoms. Evidence
      concerning the correlates of disordered eating was limited. CONCLUSIONS: The
      presence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI
      disorders than in populations of healthy controls, but the direction of the
      relationship is not clear. Implications for further research are discussed.

LID - 10.5009/gnl13437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent papers have highlighted the role of diet and lifestyle
      habits in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but very few population-based studies
      have evaluated this association in developing countries. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the association between diet and lifestyle habits and IBS.
      METHODS: A food frequency and lifestyle habits questionnaire was used to record
      the diet and lifestyle habits of 78 IBS subjects and 79 healthy subjects.
      Cross-tabulation analysis and logistic regression were used to reveal any
      association among lifestyle habits, eating habits, food consumption frequency,
      and other associated conditions. RESULTS: The results from logistic regression
      analysis indicated that IBS was associated with irregular eating (odds ratio
      [OR], 3.257), physical inactivity (OR, 3.588), and good quality sleep (OR,
      0.132). IBS subjects ate fruit (OR, 3.082) vegetables (OR, 3.778), and legumes
      (OR, 2.111) and drank tea (OR, 2.221) significantly more frequently than the
      control subjects. After adjusting for age and sex, irregular eating (OR, 3.963), 
      physical inactivity (OR, 6.297), eating vegetables (OR, 7.904), legumes (OR,
      2.674), drinking tea (OR, 3.421) and good quality sleep (OR, 0.054) were
      independent predictors of IBS. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a possible
      association between diet and lifestyle habits and IBS.

AB  - A variety of human disease conditions are associated with chronic intestinal
      disorders or enteropathies that are characterized by intestinal inflammation,
      increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Such
      disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to
      symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and
      malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in
      understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between 
      the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying
      immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during
      enteropathy are still not available. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
      ability of oral immunoglobulins to improve weight gain, support gut barrier
      function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animals. More recently,
      studies in humans provide evidence that serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin/protein isolate is safe and improves nutritional status and GI
      symptoms in patients with enteropathy associated with irritable bowel syndrome or
      infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. This review summarizes studies
      showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially
      formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and
      nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein
      preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary
      management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have
      limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs
      or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements
      that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.

TI  - Effect of dietary management on the gastric endocrine cells in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 519-24
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2014.151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gastric endocrine cells in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) tend to normalize following dietary guidance. The aim of the
      present study was to identify the gastric endocrine cell types that are changed
      following such dietary guidance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fourteen IBS patients and 14
      healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of 
      individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the
      controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9
      months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were
      immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were
      quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin 
      cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were
      149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 
      +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the
      gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/-
      24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of
      serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4
      and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI
      18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the
      somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/-
      3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 
      22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell
      types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a 
      change in food intake.

TI  - Diets that differ in their FODMAP content alter the colonic luminal
      microenvironment.
PG  - 93-100
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307264 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides,
      Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet reduces symptoms of IBS, but reduction of
      potential prebiotic and fermentative effects might adversely affect the colonic
      microenvironment. The effects of a low FODMAP diet with a typical Australian diet
      on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a single-blinded, randomised,
      cross-over trial. DESIGN: Twenty-seven IBS and six healthy subjects were randomly
      allocated one of two 21-day provided diets, differing only in FODMAP content
      (mean (95% CI) low 3.05 (1.86 to 4.25) g/day vs Australian 23.7 (16.9 to 30.6)
      g/day), and then crossed over to the other diet with >/=21-day washout period.
      Faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on their habitual diet and from day 17 to day
      21 of the interventional diets were pooled, and pH, short-chain fatty acid
      concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed. RESULTS:
      Faecal indices were similar in IBS and healthy subjects during habitual diets.
      The low FODMAP diet was associated with higher faecal pH (7.37 (7.23 to 7.51) vs.
      7.16 (7.02 to 7.30); p=0.001), similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations,
      greater microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance (9.63 (9.53 to 
      9.73) vs. 9.83 (9.72 to 9.93) log10 copies/g; p<0.001) compared with the
      Australian diet. To indicate direction of change, in comparison with the habitual
      diet the low FODMAP diet reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical
      Australian diet increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing Clostridium
      cluster XIVa (median ratio 6.62; p<0.001) and mucus-associated Akkermansia
      muciniphila (19.3; p<0.001), and reduced Ruminococcus torques. CONCLUSIONS: Diets
      differing in FODMAP content have marked effects on gut microbiota composition.
      The implications of long-term reduction of intake of FODMAPs require elucidation.

TI  - A case-control study of current psychological well-being and weight-teasing
      history in young adults with and without bowel conditions.
PG  - 28-36
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being
      and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac
      disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from 
      those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years)
      completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed
      psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem,
      and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and
      weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition
      participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls =
      504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional
      logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics.
      RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall
      psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05)
      more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression,
      anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were
      also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P =
      0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing
      insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also
      more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 
      1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of
      their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study
      suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of 
      young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to
      develop skills and strategies for coping.
