AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, rheumatic disease
      characterized by widespread myofascial pain, of unknown aetiology, having a major
      impact on quality of life (QOL). Available pharmacotherapy for FM is marginally
      effective. FM is associated with co-morbidities of gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). There is growing evidence that
      diets low in FODMAPs, "fermentable oligo-, di- or mono-saccharides and polyols"
      [Low FODMAP Diet (LFD)], are effective in treating IBS. The aim of this pilot
      study was to examine the effects of LFDs on symptoms of FM, especially with
      regard to pain, QOL and GI disorders. METHODS: A longitudinal study using LFD
      intervention was performed on 38, 51+/-10 year-old, female patients diagnosed
      with FM for an average of 10 years, based on ACR (American College of
      Rheumatology) 2010 criteria. The study was conducted from January through May,
      2015, using a four-week, repeated-assessment model, as follows: Moment 0 -
      introduction of the protocol to participants; Moment 1 - first assessment and
      delivery of individual LFD dietary plans; Moment 2 - second assessment and
      reintroduction of FODMAPs; Moment 3 - last assessment and final nutritional
      counselling. Assessment tools used were the following: RFIQ (Revised Fibromyalgia
      Impact Questionnaire), FSQ (Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire), IBS-SSS (Severity
      Score System), EQ-5D (Euro-QOL quality of life instrument), and VAS (Visual
      Analogue Scale). Daily consumption of FODMAPs was quantified based on published
      food content analyses. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, non-parametric
      Friedman, t-student and Chi-square tests, using SPSS 22 software. RESULTS: The
      mean scores of the 38 participants at the beginning of the study were: FSQ
      (severity of FM, 0-31) - 22+/-4.4; RFIQ (0-100) - 65+/-17; IBS-SSS (0-500) -
      275+/-101; and EQ-5D (0-100) - 48+/-19. Mean adherence to dietary regimens was
      86%, confirmed by significant difference in FODMAP intakes (25g/day vs. 2.5g/day;
      p<0.01). Comparisons between the three moments of assessment showed significant
      (p<0.01) declines in scores in VAS, FSQ, and RFIQ scores, in all domains
      measured. An important improvement was observed with a reduction in the severity 
      of GI symptoms, with 50% reduction in IBS scores to 138+/-117, following LFD
      therapy. A significant correlation (r=0.36; p<0.05) was found between
      improvements in FM impact (declined scores) and gastrointestinal scores. There
      was also a significant correlation (r=0.65; p<0.01) between "satisfaction with
      improvement" after introduction of LFDs and "diet adherence", with satisfaction
      of the diet achieving 77% among participants. A significant difference was
      observed between patients who improved as compared to those that did not improve 
      (Chi-square chi(2)=6.16; p<.05), showing that the probability of improvement,
      depends on the severity of the RFIQ score. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of diet
      therapy involving FODMAP restrictions, in this cohort of FM patients, resulted in
      a significant reduction in GI disorders and FM symptoms, including pain scores.
      These results need to be extended in future larger studies on dietary therapy for
      treatment of FM. IMPLICATIONS: According to current scientific knowledge, these
      are the first relevant results found in an intervention with LFD therapy in FM
      and must be reproduced looking for a future dietetic approach in FM.

AB  - Traditionally, irritable bowel syndrome has been considered to be a disorder with
      no known underlying structural or biochemical explanation, but this concept is
      likely to be outdated. In this Review we challenge the widely accepted view that 
      irritable bowel syndrome is an unexplained brain-gut disorder. There is
      epidemiological evidence that, in a major subset of patients, gastrointestinal
      symptoms arise first and only later do incident mood disorders occur.
      Additionally, possible mechanisms for gut-brain dysfunction have been identified,
      suggesting primary gut disturbances might be the underlying cause in a subgroup. 
      Underlying mechanisms that could lead to irritable bowel syndrome include genetic
      factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, 
      chronic infections and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade
      mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability;
      disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10-20% of cases with diarrhoea);
      abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function, which
      could be primary or secondary factors. Identical irritable bowel syndrome
      symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with 
      this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant
      subtypes promotes heterogeneity. An approach based on the underlying
      pathophysiology could help to develop therapies that target causes and ultimately
      provide a cure for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - In this Clinical practice guide, an analysis is made of the diagnosis and
      treatment of adult patients with constipation and abdominal discomfort, under the
      spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation. These have an
      important personal, health and social impact, affecting the quality of life of
      these patients. In irritable bowel syndrome with a predominance of constipation, 
      this is the predominant change in bowel movements, with recurrent abdominal pain,
      bloating and frequent abdominal distension. Constipation is characterised by
      infrequent or difficulty in bowel movements, associated with excessive straining 
      during bowel movement or sensation of incomplete evacuation. There is often no
      underling cause, with an intestinal functional disorder being considered. They
      have many clinical and pathophysiological similarities, with a similar response
      of the constipation to common drugs. The fundamental difference is the presence
      or absence of pain, but not in a way evaluable way; "all or nothing". The
      severity depends on the intensity of bowel symptoms and other factors, a
      combination of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms, level of
      involvement, forms of perception, and behaviour. The Rome criteria diagnose
      functional bowel disorders. This guide is adapted to the Rome criteria IV (May
      2016) and in this first part an analysis is made of the alarm criteria,
      diagnostic tests, and the criteria for referral between Primary Care and
      Digestive Disease specialists. In the second part, a review will be made of the
      therapeutic alternatives available (exercise, diet, drug therapies,
      neurostimulation of sacral roots, or surgery), making practical recommendations
      for each one of them.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that children with celiac disease (CD) on
      gluten-free diet are at increased risk of abdominal pain (AP)
      associated-functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). STUDY DESIGN: This was 
      a multinational cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 2015. Patients 4-18 
      years of age with CD on gluten-free diet for longer than 6 months were recruited 
      from pediatric CD clinics in US and Italy. Control groups included siblings of
      children with CD (with normal tissue transglutaminase levels) and unrelated
      controls. Subjects or parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III. RESULTS: Children (n = 289) were recruited
      (55% US, 45% Italy): 96 children with CD, 96 sibling controls, and 97 unrelated
      controls. Chronic AP was present in 30 (30.9%) subjects with CD, 22 (22.7%)
      sibling controls, and 21 (21.6%) unrelated controls (P = .26 patients with CD vs 
      siblings; P = .18 patients with CD vs unrelated; P = .96 siblings vs unrelated). 
      AP-FGIDs were present in 8 (8.2%) subjects with CD, 8 (8.2%) sibling controls,
      and 2 (2.1%) unrelated controls (P = 1.00 subjects with CD vs sibling controls; P
      = .06 subjects with CD vs unrelated controls; P = .06 sibling controls vs
      unrelated controls). CONCLUSION: This multinational study evaluated the
      prevalence of chronic abdominal pain and AP-FGIDs in the pediatric population
      with CD. We found that subjects with CD and controls have a similar prevalence of
      chronic AP and AP-FGIDs. This suggests that not all types of gastrointestinal
      inflammation result in AP-FGIDs in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Non-invasive biomarkers which identify different mechanisms of
      disease in subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could be valuable. Our aim
      was to seek useful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters that could
      distinguish each IBS subtypes. METHODS: 34 healthy volunteers (HV), 30 IBS with
      diarrhea (IBS-D), 16 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), and 11 IBS with mixed bowel
      habit (IBS-M) underwent whole-gut transit and small and large bowel volumes
      assessment with MRI scans from t=0 to t=360 min. Since the bowel frequency for
      IBS-M were similar to IBS-D, IBS-M and IBS-D were grouped together and labeled as
      IBS non-constipation group (IBS-nonC). RESULTS: Median (interquartile range):
      fasting small bowel water content in IBS-nonC was 21 (10-42), significantly less 
      than HV at 44 ml (15-70), P<0.01 as was the postprandial area under the curve
      (AUC) P<0.01. The fasting transverse colon volumes in IBS-C were significantly
      larger at 253 (200-329) compared with HV, IBS-nonC whose values were 165
      (117-255) and 198 (106-270) ml, respectively, P=0.02. Whole-gut transit time for 
      IBS-C was prolonged at 69 (51-111), compared with HV at 34 (4-63) and IBS-D at 34
      (17-78) h, P=0.03. Bloating score (VAS 0-10 cm) correlated with transverse colon 
      volume at t=405 min, Spearman r=0.21, P=0.04. CONCLUSIONS: The constricted small 
      bowel in IBS-nonC and the dilated transverse colon in IBS-C point to significant 
      differences in underlying mechanisms of disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown, but
      several factors appear to play a role in its pathophysiology, including
      abnormalities of the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. The present review
      illuminates the possible role of gastrointestinal hormones in the pathophysiology
      of IBS and the possibility of utilizing the current knowledge in treating the
      disease. Areas covered: Research into the intestinal endocrine cells and their
      possible role in the pathophysiology of IBS is discussed. Furthermore, the
      mechanisms underlying the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells
      in IBS patients are revealed. Expert commentary: The abnormalities observed in
      the gastrointestinal endocrine cells in IBS patients explains their visceral
      hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and abnormal intestinal
      secretion, as well as the interchangeability of symptoms over time. Clarifying
      the role of the intestinal stem cells in the pathophysiology of IBS may lead to
      new treatment methods for IBS.

AB  - This article discusses the most interesting presentations at Digestive Disease
      Week, held in San Diego, in the field of functional and motor gastrointestinal
      disorders. One of the most important contributions was undoubtedly the
      presentation of the new Rome IV diagnostic criteria for functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. We therefore devote some space in this article to
      explaining these new criteria in the most common functional disorders. In fact,
      there has already been discussion of data comparing Rome IV and Rome III criteria
      in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, confirming that the new criteria
      are somewhat more restrictive. From the physiopathological point of view, several
      studies have shown that the aggregation of physiopathological alterations
      increases symptom severity in distinct functional disorders. From the therapeutic
      point of view, more data were presented on the efficacy of acotiamide and its
      mechanisms of action in functional dyspepsia, the safety and efficacy of
      domperidone in patients with gastroparesis, and the efficacy of linaclotide both 
      in irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. In irritable bowel syndrome, more
      data have come to light on the favourable results of a low FODMAP diet, with
      emphasis on its role in modifying the microbiota. Finally, long-term efficacy
      data were presented on the distinct treatment options in achalasia.

TI  - Gut Microbiota, Bacterial Translocation, and Interactions with Diet:
      Pathophysiological Links between Major Depressive Disorder and Non-Communicable
      Medical Comorbidities.
PG  - 31-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent low-grade immune-inflammatory processes, oxidative and
      nitrosative stress (O&amp;NS), and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation
      are integral to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The
      microbiome, intestinal compositional changes, and resultant bacterial
      translocation add a new element to the bidirectional interactions of the
      gut-brain axis; new evidence implicates these pathways in the patho-aetiology of 
      MDD. In addition, abnormalities in the gut-brain axis are associated with several
      chronic non-communicable disorders, which frequently co-occur in individuals with
      MDD, including but not limited to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue
      syndrome (CFS), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: We
      searched the PubMed/MEDLINE database up until May 1, 2016 for studies which
      investigated intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial translocation (the 'leaky gut')
      in the pathophysiology of MDD and co-occurring somatic comorbidities with an
      emphasis on IBS, CFS, obesity, and T2DM. RESULTS: The composition of the gut
      microbiota is influenced by several genetic and environmental factors (e.g.
      diet). Several lines of evidence indicate that gut-microbiota-diet interactions
      play a significant pathophysiological role in MDD and related medical
      comorbidities. Gut dysbiosis and the leaky gut may influence several pathways
      implicated in the biology of MDD, including but not limited to immune activation,
      O&amp;NS, and neuroplasticity cascades. However, methodological inconsistencies
      and limitations limit comparisons across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal
      dysbiosis and the leaky gut may constitute a key pathophysiological link between 
      MDD and its medical comorbidities. This emerging literature opens relevant
      preventative and therapeutic perspectives.

PG  - G52-G62
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00338.2016 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders. Despite its prevalence, the pathophysiology of IBS is not well
      understood although multiple peripheral and central factors are implicated.
      Recent studies suggest a role for alterations in gut microbiota in IBS.
      Significant advances in next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics 
      and the declining cost have now allowed us to better investigate the role of gut 
      microbiota in IBS. In the following review, we propose gut microbiota as a
      unifying factor in the pathophysiology of IBS. We first describe how gut
      microbiota can be influenced by factors predisposing individuals to IBS such as
      host genetics, stress, diet, antibiotics, and early life experiences. We then
      highlight the known effects of gut microbiota on mechanisms implicated in the
      pathophysiology of IBS including disrupted gut brain axis (GBA), visceral
      hypersensitivity (VH), altered GI motility, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and
      immune activation. While there are several gaps in the field that preclude us
      from connecting the dots to establish causation, we hope this overview will allow
      us to identify and fill in the voids.

TI  - Gluten-induced symptoms in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome are
      associated with increased myosin light chain kinase activity and claudin-15
      expression.
PG  - 14-23
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2016.118 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms underlying diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D)
      are poorly understood, but increased intestinal permeability is thought to
      contribute to symptoms. A recent clinical trial of gluten-free diet (GFD)
      demonstrated symptomatic improvement, relative to gluten-containing diet (GCD),
      which was associated with reduced intestinal permeability in non-celiac disease
      IBS-D patients. The aim of this study was to characterize intestinal epithelial
      tight junction composition in IBS-D before and after dietary gluten challenge.
      Biopsies from 27 IBS-D patients (13 GFD and 14 GCD) were examined by H&E staining
      and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated myosin II regulatory
      light chain (MLC), MLC kinase, claudin-2, claudin-8 and claudin-15. Diet-induced 
      changes were assessed and correlated with urinary mannitol excretion (after oral 
      administration). In the small intestine, epithelial MLC phosphorylation was
      increased or decreased by GCD or GFD, respectively, and this correlated with
      increased intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Colonocyte expression of the
      paracellular Na(+) channel claudin-15 was also markedly augmented following GCD
      challenge (P<0.05). Conversely, colonic claudin-2 expression correlated with
      reduced intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Claudin-8 expression was not affected
      by dietary challenge. These data show that alterations in MLC phosphorylation and
      claudin-15 and claudin-2 expression are associated with gluten-induced
      symptomatology and intestinal permeability changes in IBS-D. The results provide 
      new insight into IBS-D mechanisms and can explain permeability responses to
      gluten challenge in these patients.

TI  - Prevalence and Characterization of Self-Reported Gluten Sensitivity in The
      Netherlands.
LID - E714 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of individuals reports symptoms related to the
      ingestion of gluten-containing food in the absence of celiac disease. Yet the
      actual prevalence is not well established. METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 
      2016, unselected adults visiting marketplaces, dental practices and a university 
      in The Netherlands were asked to complete a modified validated questionnaire for 
      self-reported gluten sensitivity (srGS). RESULTS: Among the 785 adults enquired, 
      two had celiac disease. Forty-nine (6.2%) reported symptoms related to the
      ingestion of gluten-containing food. These individuals were younger,
      predominantly female and lived more frequently in urban regions compared with the
      other respondents. Symptoms reported included bloating (74%), abdominal
      discomfort (49%) and flatulence (47%). A total of 23 (47%) srGS individuals
      reported having had tried a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet. Abdominal
      discomfort related to fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide
      and polyol (FODMAP)-containing food was more often reported in srGS individuals
      compared with the other respondents (73.5% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:
      Self-reported GS is common in The Netherlands, especially in younger individuals,
      females and urban regions, although the prevalence was lower than in a comparable
      recent UK study. It cannot be excluded that FODMAPs are in part responsible for
      these symptoms.

AB  - In this Clinical practice guide, an analysis is made of the diagnosis and
      treatment of adult patients with constipation and abdominal discomfort, under the
      spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation. These have an
      important personal, health and social impact, affecting the quality of life of
      these patients. In irritable bowel syndrome with a predominance of constipation, 
      this is the predominant change in bowel movements, with recurrent abdominal pain,
      bloating and frequent abdominal distension. Constipation is characterised by
      infrequent or difficulty in bowel movements, associated with excessive straining 
      during bowel movement or sensation of incomplete evacuation. There is often no
      underling cause, with an intestinal functional disorder being considered. They
      have many clinical and pathophysiological similarities, with a similar response
      of the constipation to common drugs. The fundamental difference is the presence
      or absence of pain, but not in a way evaluable way; "all or nothing". The
      severity depends on the intensity of bowel symptoms and other factors, a
      combination of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms, level of
      involvement, forms of perception, and behaviour. The Rome criteria diagnose
      functional bowel disorders. This guide is adapted to the Rome criteria IV (May
      2016) and in this first part an analysis is made of the alarm criteria,
      diagnostic tests, and the criteria for referral between Primary Care and
      Digestive Disease specialists. In the second part, a review will be made of the
      therapeutic alternatives available (exercise, diet, drug therapies,
      neurostimulation of sacral roots, or surgery), making practical recommendations
      for each one of them.

AB  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FA)
      including food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food
      protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), and food protein-induced allergic
      proctocolitis (FPIAP) are relatively uncommon in infants and young children, but 
      are likely under-diagnosed. Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with
      majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of
      symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed
      for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to
      the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the
      role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is
      not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be 
      limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in
      infants.

TI  - Non-pharmacological management of abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders in children.
PG  - 389-398
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (AP-FGID)
      comprises of 4 main conditions: functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome,
      abdominal migraine and functional abdominal pain. AP-FGIDs are diagnosed
      clinically based on the Rome IV criteria for FGIDs of childhood. There is limited
      evidence for pharmacological therapies. DATA SOURCES: This review article
      discusses nonpharmacological management of AP-FGID based on the current
      literature including systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort and
      case control studies. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview on the available
      evidence for the pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists involved in
      managing children with AP-FGID. RESULTS: Managing AP-FGIDs can be challenging.
      This should follow a stepwise approach with focused history, identification of
      "red flag" signs and symptoms, physical examination and investigations done
      following initial consultation. Family needs explaining that there is nothing
      seriously wrong with the child's abdomen. This explanation and reassurance can
      achieve symptom control in large number of cases. Non-pharmacological
      interventions are delivered through lifestyle and dietary changes and
      bio-psychosocial therapies. Dietary interventions vary depending on the type of
      AP-FGID. Bio-psychosocial therapies such as hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral
      therapy and yoga aim at stress reduction. CONCLUSION: There is increasing
      evidence for use of non-pharmacological interventions in children with APFGID.

TI  - Probiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products for functional and inflammatory
      bowel disorders.
PG  - 1426-1449
LID - 10.1111/bph.13632 [doi]
AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are
      very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on
      patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. 
      A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several
      therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional
      pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre
      and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both 
      groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several
      drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics,
      in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily
      peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and
      fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may
      be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative
      colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as
      mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to
      the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the
      low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate
      the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further,
      well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic
      options in the management of both FBD and IBD. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is

TI  - [Fructose and fructose intolerance].
PG  - 1708-1716
AB  - Although fructose was discovered in 1794, it was realised in recent decades only 
      that its malabsorption can lead to intestinal symptoms while its excessive
      consumption induces metabolic disturbances. Fructose is a monosaccharide found
      naturally in most fruits and vegetables. Dietary intake of fructose has gradually
      increased in the past decades, especially because of the consumption of high
      fructose corn syrup. With its 16.4 kg/year consumption, Hungary ranks secondly
      after the United States. Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine by
      facilitated transport mediated by glucose transporter proteins-2 and -5, and
      arrives in the liver cells. Here it is transformed enzymatically into
      fructose-1-phosphate and then, fructose-1,5-diphosphate, which splits further
      into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, entering the process of
      glycolysis, triglyceride and uric acid production. The prevalence of fructose
      intolerance varies strongly, depending on the method used. The leading symptoms
      of fructose intolerance are similar, but less severe than those of lactose
      intolerance. Multiple secondary symptoms can also occur. A symptom-based
      diagnosis of fructose intolerance is possible, but the gold standard is the H2
      breath test, though this is less accurate than in lactose testing. Measuring
      fructosaemia is costly, cumbersome and not widely used. Fructose intolerance
      increases intestinal motility and sensitivity, promotes biofilm formation and
      contributes to the development of gastrooesophageal reflux. Long-term use of
      fructose fosters the development of dental caries and non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis. Its role in carcinogenesis is presently investigated. The
      cornerstone of dietary management for fructose intolerance is the individual
      reduction of fructose intake and the FODMAP diet, led by a trained dietetician.
      The newly introduced xylose-isomerase is efficient in reducing the symptoms of
      fructose intolerance. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(43), 1708-1716.

TI  - Refractory Depression, Fatigue, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and Chronic Pain: A
      Functional Medicine Case Report.
PG  - 15-242
LID - 10.7812/TPP/15-242 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Single-disorder or single-organ-system clinical practice guidelines
      are often of limited usefulness in guiding effective management of patients with 
      chronic multidimensional signs and symptoms. The presence of multiple
      long-standing medical problems in a given patient despite intensive medical
      effort suggests that addressing systemic core imbalances could complement more
      narrowly focused approaches. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man experiencing
      longstanding depression, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic pain in
      the context of additional refractory illnesses was assessed and treated, guided
      by a system-oriented approach to underlying core imbalances termed functional
      medicine. This patient was referred from a team of clinicians representing
      primary care, cardiology, gastroenterology, hematology, and psychology. Prior
      treatment had been unsuccessful in managing multiple chronic comorbidities.
      Diagnostic assessment included comprehensive stool and nutritional/metabolic
      laboratory testing. RESULTS: The blood-, urine-, or stool-based measurements of
      relevant markers for multiple systemic issues, including digestion/absorption,
      inflammation, oxidative stress, and methylation, identified previously
      unrecognized root causes of his constellation of symptoms. These functional
      measurements guided rational recommendations for dietary choices and
      supplementation. The patient experienced steady and significant improvement in
      his mental health, fatigue, chronic pain, and irritable bowel syndrome-as well as
      the unexpected resolution of his chronic idiopathic pancytopenia. CONCLUSION: The
      success in this case suggests that other patients with chronic, complex, and
      treatment-refractory illness may benefit from a system-oriented assessment of
      core imbalances guided by specialized nutritional/metabolic and digestive
      laboratory testing.

AB  - Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a
      given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool
      consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as 
      key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased
      stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to
      self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader
      differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used
      cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of
      particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from
      some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before
      defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool
      form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need
      some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct
      therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy
      can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of
      history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there
      is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further
      delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology,
      and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every 
      patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed
      testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to
      mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not
      available.

TI  - Effects of varying dietary content of fermentable short-chain carbohydrates on
      symptoms, fecal microenvironment, and cytokine profiles in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) is increasingly recommended for patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to investigate the effects of a
      blinded low-FODMAP vs high-fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) diet on symptoms, immune
      activation, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
      METHODS: Twenty patients with diarrhea-predominant or mixed IBS were instructed
      to follow a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) throughout a 9-week study period. After 3
      weeks, they were randomized and double-blindly assigned to receive a supplement
      of either FOS (FODMAP) or maltodextrin (placebo) for the next 10 days, followed
      by a 3-week washout period before crossover. Irritable bowel syndrome severity
      scoring system (IBS-SSS) was used to evaluate symptoms. Cytokines (interleukin
      [IL]-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were analyzed in blood samples,
      and gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA) and SCFAs were analyzed in fecal
      samples. KEY RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms consistently improved
      after 3 weeks of LFD, and significantly more participants reported symptom relief
      in response to placebo (80%) than FOS (30%). Serum levels of proinflammatory IL-6
      and IL-8, as well as levels of fecal bacteria (Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium,
      and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), total SCFAs, and n-butyric acid, decreased
      significantly on the LFD as compared to baseline. Ten days of FOS supplementation
      increased the level of these bacteria, whereas levels of cytokines and SCFAs
      remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Our findings support the efficacy
      of a LFD in alleviating IBS symptoms, and show changes in inflammatory cytokines,
      microbiota profile, and SCFAs, which may have consequences for gut health.

TI  - Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity.
PG  - 63
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A new syndrome responding to gluten-free diet and defined
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity entered the spectrum of gluten-related disorders,
      together with celiac disease and wheat allergy. However, its definition,
      prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment, and follow up are still
      controversial. The purpose of the review is to summarize the evidence and
      problems emerging from the current literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Direct
      implication of gluten in the onset of symptoms is often unproved as a low
      fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols diet or other components
      of cereals as wheat amylase trypsin inhibitor could be similarly involved. To
      date, no specific biomarkers or histological abnormalities confirm diagnosis, and
      only the self-reported response to gluten-free diet as well as a positive double 
      blind placebo-gluten challenge characterizes these non-celiac, non-wheat allergic
      patients. Critical revision of published studies can offer practical indications 
      in approaching this clinical topic and useful suggestions to standardize
      scientific researches.

TI  - Functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 467-473
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional dyspepsia affects 10% of the population. Emerging
      data are beginning to unravel the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disorder,
      and new data on treatment are helping to guide evidence-based practice. In this
      review, the latest advances are summarized and discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: The
      Rome IV criteria were published in 2016 and are similar to Rome III but further
      emphasize the subtypes (postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain
      syndrome) rather than focussing on the syndrome as a whole, and conclude that
      gastroesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome are part of the
      functional dyspepsia spectrum. Environment is dominant in the pathogenesis. New
      data implicate herbivore pets and antibiotic exposure for a nongastrointestinal
      infection but require confirmation. Further experimental data suggest duodenal
      eosinophils and mast cells can alter enteric neuronal structure and function in
      functional dyspepsia. SUMMARY: Advances in our understanding of functional
      dyspepsia are changing clinical practice.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing the Low FODMAP Diet vs. Modified NICE
      Guidelines in US Adults with IBS-D.
PG  - 1824-1832
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.434 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There has been an increasing interest in the role of fermentable
      oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We report results from the first randomized controlled trial of
      the low FODMAP diet in US adults with IBS and diarrhea (IBS-D). The objectives
      were to compare the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet vs. a diet based upon
      modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines (mNICE) on 
      overall and individual symptoms in IBS-D patients. METHODS: This was a
      single-center, randomized-controlled trial of adult patients with IBS-D (Rome
      III) which compared 2 diet interventions. After a 2-week screening period,
      eligible patients were randomized to a low FODMAP or mNICE diet for 4 weeks. The 
      primary end point was the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of
      IBS-D symptoms >/=50% of intervention weeks 3-4. Secondary outcomes included a
      composite end point which required response in both abdominal pain (>/=30%
      reduction in mean daily pain score compared with baseline) and stool consistency 
      (decrease in mean daily Bristol Stool Form of >/=1 compared with baseline),
      abdominal pain and stool consistency responders, and other key individual IBS
      symptoms assessed using daily questionnaires. RESULTS: After screening, 92
      subjects (65 women, median age 42.6 years) were randomized. Eighty-four patients 
      completed the study (45 low FODMAP, 39 mNICE). Baseline demographics, symptom
      severity, and nutrient intake were similar between groups. Fifty-two percent of
      the low FODMAP vs. 41% of the mNICE group reported adequate relief of their IBS-D
      symptoms (P=0.31). Though there was no significant difference in the proportion
      of composite end point responders (P=0.13), the low FODMAP diet resulted in a
      higher proportion of abdominal pain responders compared with the mNICE group (51%
      vs. 23%, P=0.008). Compared with baseline scores, the low FODMAP diet led to
      greater reductions in average daily scores of abdominal pain, bloating,
      consistency, frequency, and urgency than the mNICE diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this US 
      trial, 40-50% of patients reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms with
      the low FODMAP diet or a diet based on modified NICE guidelines. The low FODMAP
      diet led to significantly greater improvement in individual IBS symptoms,
      particularly pain and bloating, compared with the mNICE diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have limited knowledge about the association between the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota and clinical features of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We collected information on the fecal and mucosa-associated
      microbiota of patients with IBS and evaluated whether these were associated with 
      symptoms. METHODS: We collected fecal and mucosal samples from adult patients who
      met the Rome III criteria for IBS at a secondary/tertiary care outpatient clinics
      in Sweden, as well as from healthy subjects. The exploratory set comprised 149
      subjects (110 with IBS and 39 healthy subjects); 232 fecal samples and 59 mucosal
      biopsy samples were collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA targeted
      pyrosequencing. The validation set comprised 46 subjects (29 with IBS and 17
      healthy subjects); 46 fecal samples, but no mucosal samples, were collected and
      analyzed. For each subject, we measured exhaled H2 and CH4, oro-anal transit
      time, and the severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal
      methanogens were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Numerical
      ecology analyses and a machine learning procedure were used to analyze the data. 
      RESULTS: Fecal microbiota showed covariation with mucosal adherent microbiota. By
      using classic approaches, we found no differences in fecal microbiota abundance
      or composition between patients with IBS vs healthy patients. A machine learning 
      procedure, a computational statistical technique, allowed us to reduce the 16S
      ribosomal RNA data complexity into a microbial signature for severe IBS,
      consisting of 90 bacterial operational taxonomic units. We confirmed the
      robustness of the intestinal microbial signature for severe IBS in the validation
      set. The signature was able to discriminate between patients with severe
      symptoms, patients with mild/moderate symptoms, and healthy subjects. By using
      this intestinal microbiota signature, we found IBS symptom severity to be
      associated negatively with microbial richness, exhaled CH4, presence of
      methanogens, and enterotypes enriched with Clostridiales or Prevotella species.
      This microbiota signature could not be explained by differences in diet or use of
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing fecal and mucosal microbiota from patients
      with IBS and healthy individuals, we identified an intestinal microbiota profile 
      that is associated with the severity of IBS symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Long-term response to gluten-free diet as evidence for non-celiac wheat
      sensitivity in one third of patients with diarrhea-dominant and mixed-type
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 29-39
LID - 10.1007/s00384-016-2663-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common but therapies are
      unsatisfactory. Food is often suspected as cause by patients, but diagnostic
      procedures, apart from allergy testing, are limited. Based on the hypothesis of
      non-celiac wheat sensitivity (WS) in a subgroup of IBS patients, we tested the
      long-term response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and investigated HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8
      expression as a diagnostic marker for WS in diarrhea-dominant (IBS-D) and
      mixed-type IBS (IBS-M). METHODS: The response to a GFD served as reference test
      for WS and HLA-DQ2/8 expression was determined as index test. Patients were
      classified as responders if they reported complete or considerable relief of IBS 
      symptoms on at least 75 % of weeks over a 4-month period of gluten-free diet.
      Established questionnaires (IBS-Quality of Life (IBS-QoL), IBS Symptom Severity
      Scale (IBS-SSS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)) were used for
      secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients finished the study. Of 
      these, 12 (34 %) were responders and classified as having WS (95 % CI 21-51 %).
      HLA-DQ2/8 expression had a specificity of 52 % (95 % CI 33-71 %) and sensitivity 
      of 25 % (95 % CI 8-54 %) for WS. Responders showed improvement in quality of life
      and symptom scores. At 1-year follow-up, all responders and 55 % of
      non-responders were still on GFD and reported symptom relief. CONCLUSION: Using
      strict criteria as recommended for IBS studies, about one third of patients with 
      IBS-D or IBS-M are wheat sensitive, with a similar proportion in both IBS types. 
      Expression of HLA-DQ2/8 is not useful as diagnostic marker for WS. Long-term
      adherence to a GFD is high and can sustain symptomatic improvement.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder. Up to 96%
      of IBS patients experience bloating, resulting in poor response to conventional
      therapies and high consultation rates. Many IBS patients report that food
      triggers symptoms, particularly diets with poorly absorbed, short-chain
      carbohydrates, and restrict intake of certain foods to control their symptoms.
      IBS patients are especially susceptible to an attack due to visceral
      hypersensitivity. An emerging therapeutic strategy excludes fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) from the
      diet. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in improving
      symptoms of bloating in IBS patients. Individualised, structured dietary guidance
      may benefit those with persistent troublesome symptoms despite traditional
      therapies. In view of the multifactorial aetiology of the condition, it is
      probably best to use a multipronged approach, involving combination therapies, to
      address bloating in IBS patients.

AB  - Chronic, non-infectious diarrhea can be caused by a variety of gastrointestinal
      diseases. In anamnesis, it is important to take accompanying warning symptoms and
      specific triggers into account. The fecal inflammatory marker calprotectin may
      help differentiating between organic and functional gastrointestinal disorders,
      but it is not specific. Among other options, gelling fibres, Loperamide and
      Cholestyramine as well as probiotics are available for the symptomatic treatment 
      of chronic diarrhea. For long-term treatment of chronic diarrhea with the
      enkephalinase inhibitor racecadotril, which is approved for acute diarrhea, only 
      limited data are available. Eluxadolin presents a new therapeutic option. It can 
      alleviate abdominal pain and diarrhea by modulation of opioid receptors in the
      enteric nervous system. Additional approaches in intractable irritable bowel
      syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) include 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, the antibiotic
      Rifaximin as well as low-dose tricyclic antidepressants. Specific diets such as
      the low-FODMAP diet can also relieve symptoms in IBS.

TI  - The feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of traditional paper food and
      symptom journals for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paper food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journals are used to
      help irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients determine potential trigger foods.
      The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and
      clinical utility of such journals as a data collection tool. A secondary aim was 
      to explore a method for analyzing journal data to describe patterns of diet and
      symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=17) were asked to log three sets of 3-day food
      and symptom journals over a 15-day period. Feasibility was evaluated by journal
      completion rates, symptom logging compliance, and logging fatigability. The
      feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of journaling were also assessed by 
      a customized evaluation and exit interview. For each journal, regression analyses
      were conducted to examine relationships between key meal nutrients and subsequent
      symptoms. KEY RESULTS: Most participants were young (mean age 35+/-12) Caucasian 
      (N=13) women (N=14). Journal completion rates were 100% for all participants with
      no logging fatigability. Over half perceived paper journaling of food and
      symptoms as feasible, usable, and clinically useful. Thirteen participants
      demonstrated a strong association with at least one symptom and meal nutrient.
      Patterns of associations differed among participants. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES:
      Paper journaling of food and GI symptoms for 9 days over a 15-day period appeared
      to be a feasible and usable data collection tool for IBS patients. Over half
      perceived journaling as at least somewhat clinically useful. Findings from this
      study support the anecdote that food trigger(s) and associated symptom(s) vary
      for each individual.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) has been found to significantly reduce symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet is best implemented in two phases: initial strict 
      elimination of foods high in FODMAPs, then gradual reintroduction based on
      symptoms. Further study of this diet's effect on intestinal microbiota is needed.

AB  - Diet is considered an important triggering factor for gastrointestinal symptoms
      whose physiopathology includes not only measurable, inflammatory reactions, but
      also functional disorders, where no organic effects may be measured or
      demonstrated. Moreover, the prevalence of the perceived intolerance to certain
      foods ranges from 20-25% (within the general population) to 50-70% in diseases
      like irritable bowel syndrome. This intolerance has been observed particularly
      after the consumption of milk and dairy products, which are frequently considered
      as causative of gastrointestinal symptoms, thus limiting their ingestion.
      However, this behavior reduces the dietary sources of calcium and consequently
      may lead to malnutrition and bone decalcification, amongst other complications.
      The true dairy intolerance (intestinal lactase deficiency) explains most of the
      symptoms ensuing their consumption, but the frequency of such alteration on the
      different gastrointestinal diseases has not been determined. This review focuses 
      on the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases and the existing evidence
      regarding the alterations and symptoms related to the consumption of milk or
      dairy products.

TI  - Adding glucose to food and solutions to enhance fructose absorption is not
      effective in preventing fructose-induced functional gastrointestinal symptoms:
      randomised controlled trials in patients with fructose malabsorption.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, the absorption of fructose in excess of
      glucose in solution is enhanced by the addition of glucose. The present study
      aimed to assess the effects of glucose addition to fructose or fructans on
      absorption patterns and genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with
      functional bowel disorders. METHODS: Randomised, blinded, cross-over studies were
      performed in healthy subjects and functional bowel disorder patients with
      fructose malabsorption. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) was determined for breath 
      hydrogen and symptom responses to: (i) six sugar solutions (fructose in solution)
      (glucose; sucrose; fructose; fructose + glucose; fructan; fructan + glucose) and 
      (ii) whole foods (fructose in foods) containing fructose in excess of glucose
      given with and without additional glucose. Intake of fermentable short chain
      carbohydrates (FODMAPs; fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols)
      was controlled. RESULTS: For the fructose in solution study, in 26 patients with 
      functional bowel disorders, breath hydrogen was reduced after glucose was added
      to fructose compared to fructose alone [mean (SD) AUC 92 (107) versus 859 (980)
      ppm 4 h(-1) , respectively; P = 0.034). Glucose had no effect on breath hydrogen 
      response to fructans (P = 1.000). The six healthy controls showed breath hydrogen
      patterns similar to those with functional bowel disorders. No differences in
      symptoms were experienced with the addition of glucose, except more nausea when
      glucose was added to fructose (P = 0.049). In the fructose in foods study,
      glucose addition to whole foods containing fructose in excess of glucose in nine 
      patients with functional bowel disorders and nine healthy controls had no
      significant effect on breath hydrogen production or symptom response.
      CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a favourable response on symptoms does not support
      the concomitant intake of glucose with foods high in either fructose or fructans 
      in patients with functional bowel disorders.

TI  - Ketogenic Weight Loss: The Lowering of Insulin Levels Is the Sleeping Giant in
      Patient Care.
PG  - 63-66
AB  - Research conducted by members of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians
      (recently renamed the Obesity Medicine Association) and others shows remark- able
      health benefits associated with wellness protocols that limit the intake of
      carbohydrates and sugars, which results in lower insulin demand and levels. The
      research demonstrates that the lowering of insulin levels dramatically improves
      diabetes'-5 and the factors associated with metabolic syndrome,6-8 including cen-
      tral obesity, high blood pressure, and elevated blood lipids, which, of course,
      are risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Other conditions that
      have shown improvement under the influence of reduced insulin levels include
      fatty liver disease,9 polycystic ovary syndrome,10 gastroesophageal reflux
      disease,"12 irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea,13 and other maladies.
      Significantly, dietary carbohydrate restriction induces ketosis, a state in which
      the body is forced to burn fat instead of sugar as its primary source of fuel.
      When in ketosis, patients are able to lose weight safely, effectively, and
      relatively quickly.

AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten challenge has been proposed to confirm
      a diagnosis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in patients without celiac
      disease who respond to a gluten-free diet. To determine the accuracy of this
      approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      gluten-challenge trials, comprising 1312 adults. The studies varied in the
      duration of the challenge (range, 1 d to 6 wk), daily doses for the gluten
      challenge (range, 2-52 g; 3 studies administered <8 g/d), and composition of the 
      placebo (gluten-free products, xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch
      containing fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found gluten challenge
      to significantly increase symptom scores compared with placebo. However, only 38 
      of 231 NCGS patients (16%) showed gluten-specific symptoms. Furthermore, 40% of
      these subjects had a nocebo response (similar or increased symptoms in response
      to placebo). These findings reveal heterogeneity and potential methodology flaws 
      among studies of gluten challenge, cast doubt on gluten as the culprit food
      component in most patients with presumptive NCGS, and highlight the importance of
      the nocebo effect in these types of studies.

TI  - Review: The Role of MOP and DOP Receptors in Treatment of Diarrheapredominant
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 1462-1469
AB  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a frequent functional
      disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract affecting nearly one fifth of the
      worldwide population. IBS-D is associated with numerous symptoms including
      diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain and discomfort, which significantly reduce
      patients' quality of life. Due to a complex and unclear pathogenesis, effective
      therapy against IBS-D has not been developed yet. Nowadays, treatment is focused 
      on non-pharmacological (e.g. changes in diet and life style) and pharmacological 
      (e.g. loperamide, ramosetron, rifaximin) approaches. The endogenous opioid system
      is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis in the GI tract. Activation of 
      the intestinal opioid receptors (ORs), in particular mu (MOP) and delta (DOP)
      results in reduction of epithelial secretion and increase of water/electrolyte
      absorption; moreover, opioids are strong analgesic agents. Thus, ligands of ORs
      are a promising target in IBS-D treatment. In this review, we discuss the role of
      ORs in the pathogenesis of IBS-D and the use of "classical" and novel, such as
      P-317, eluxadoline and biphalin MOP and DOP receptor ligands in preclinical and
      clinical trials.

AB  - Although abdominal pain is a symptom of several structural gastrointestinal
      disorders (eg, peptic ulcer disease), this comprehensive review will focus on the
      4 most common nonstructural, or functional, disorders associated with abdominal
      pain: functional dyspepsia, constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome, and functional abdominal pain syndrome. Together, these
      conditions affect approximately 1 in 4 people in the United States. They are
      associated with comorbid conditions (eg, fibromyalgia and depression), impaired
      quality of life, and increased health care utilization. Symptoms are explained by
      disordered gastrointestinal motility and sensation, which are implicated in
      various peripheral (eg, postinfectious inflammation and luminal irritants) and/or
      central (eg, stress and anxiety) factors. These disorders are defined and can
      generally be diagnosed by symptoms alone. Often prompted by alarm features,
      selected testing is useful to exclude structural disease. Identifying the
      specific diagnosis (eg, differentiating between functional abdominal pain and
      irritable bowel syndrome) and establishing an effective patient-physician
      relationship are the cornerstones of therapy. Many patients with mild symptoms
      can be effectively managed with limited tests, sensible dietary modifications,
      and over-the-counter medications tailored to symptoms. If these measures are not 
      sufficient, pharmacotherapy should be considered for bowel symptoms (constipation
      or diarrhea) and/or abdominal pain; opioids should not be used. Behavioral and
      psychological approaches (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) can be helpful,
      particularly in patients with chronic abdominal pain who require a
      multidisciplinary pain management program without opioids.

TI  - Fecal Fermentation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Influence of Dietary Restriction 
      of Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols.
PG  - 50-6
LID - 10.1159/000448280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dietary restriction of fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may relieve symptoms in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether this diet
      alters microbial fermentation, a process that may be involved in IBS symptom
      generation. METHODS: Patients with IBS were included consecutively to participate
      in a 4-week FODMAP restricted diet. IBS symptoms were evaluated by using the IBS 
      severity scoring system (IBS-SSS). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed 
      in fecal samples before and after the dietary intervention, both at baseline and 
      after in vitro fermentation for 24 h. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients completed the
      study. Following the dietary intervention, IBS-SSS scores improved significantly 
      (p < 0.0001). Total SCFA levels were reduced in fecal samples analyzed both at
      baseline (p = 0.005) and after in vitro fermentation for 24 h (p = 0.013).
      Following diet, baseline levels of acetic (p = 0.003) and n-butyric acids (p =
      0.009) decreased, whereas 24 h levels of i-butyric (p = 0.003) and i-valeric
      acids (p = 0.003) increased. Fecal SCFA levels and IBS symptom scores were not
      correlated. CONCLUSION: Dietary FODMAP restriction markedly modulated fecal
      fermentation in patients with IBS. Saccharolytic fermentation decreased, while
      proteolytic fermentation increased, apparently independent of symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features of different racial patients with
      celiac disease (CD) and analyze the disease prevalence, diagnosis and treatment
      in Chinese population. METHODS: All the patients were diagnosed as CD and
      enrolled in Beijing United Family Hospital between January 2005 and July
      2015.Clinical data including nationality, age, symptoms, endoscopic and
      pathological findings, outcome were collected and compared in patients from
      different countries. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were enrolled including 63
      Caucasians, 18 Asian patients and 6 Middle East patients.The peak age of disease 
      onset was 40-60 years old.Patients with typical symptoms such as chronic diarrhea
      and weight loss only accounted for 20.7%(18/87) and 9.2%(8/87) respectively.Some 
      patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating 
      [32.2%(28/87)], even constipation [5.7%(5/87)].13.8%(12/87) patients were
      previously diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.The incidence of abdominal pain,
      bloating, diarrhea and constipation between Asians and Caucasians had no
      statistical significance (P>0.05); but the proportions of weight loss, growth
      retardation, iron deficiency anemia and dermatitis herpetiformis in Asian group
      were significantly higher than that in Caucasian group (P<0.05). IgA type of
      anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and tissue
      transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) were dominant autoimmune antibodies in patients 
      with CD, which accounted for 58.6%(51/87), 44.8%(39/87) and 36.8%(32/87)
      respectively.The endoscopy showed that the lesion of CD was mainly located in
      small intestine, with reducing severity from the proximal to the distal small
      intestine.The lesions of duodenal bulb and descending duodenum appeared more
      significant in Asian group.Accordingly pathological intestinal atrophy and the
      degree of intraepithelial lymphocytosis were more severe in Asian patients.All 87
      cases took the gluten-free diet (GFD). Eighty-one cases received serological
      follow up and 8 with endoscopic intestinal biopsy.The celiac disease antibodies
      in 47 patients turned negative from 6-9 months after GFD treatment, while 34
      patients turned negative from 12-18 months after GFD.All patients reported
      disease remission to some extent.After 1 year GFD treatment, the pathology of
      endoscopic intestinal biopsy in 8 patients showed significant improvement of
      villous atrophy and lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with
      typical clinical manifestations are not the majority.Serological celiac disease
      antibodies (AGA, EMA and tTGA) have a high diagnostic value.GFD treatment is
      effective on majority of celiac patients.Clinical manifestations, endoscopy,
      intestinal pathology, and response to GFD in Chinese patients are not the same as
      Caucasians.Clinicians need to pay attention to the differential diagnosis.

TI  - [Using a multicomponent functional food in IBS patients with constipation a
      comparative controlled study].
PG  - 84-91
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal
      disorder associated with decrease in quality of life and a high social cost. Diet
      is one of several therapeutic options in IBS treatment; therefore the development
      and clinical evaluation of innovative functional food for IBS patients are
      actual. Instant drink containing 4 g inulin, 4 mg menthol and 2 mg of pyridoxine 
      (in daily dose) has been evaluated. 49 patients 18-68 (41.5+/-16.5) years old
      fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS-C were randomly assigned into two
      groups: one received standard diet plus two drinks per day for 2 weeks and
      control group received standard diet. Response to therapy was recorded daily
      using Likert scale of abdominal pain, bloating and feeling of incomplete bowel
      emptying, frequency of bowel movement, Bristol stool scale, and quality of life
      was assessed by IBSQoL questionnaire before and after the treatment. The
      consumption of the drink with inulin and menthol contributed to a significant
      positive effect on the stool parameters (from 0.91+/-0.73 to 1.12+/-0.45 bowel
      movements per day in stool frequency, p=0.05, from 2.68+/-1.63 to 3.43+/-1.27
      index Bristol scale, p=0.05), reduced the severity of abdominal pain (from
      1.78+/-0.58 to 1.47?0.61 Likert scale points, p=0.05), bloating (from 2.22+/-0.83
      to 1.53+/-0.71 points ofLikertscale,p= 0.01) and a sense of incomplete
      bowelemptying (from 2.22 +/- 0.88 to 1.61+/- 0.81 points of Likert scale,
      p=0.001), as well as increased the quality of life (from 75.3+/- 12.0 to
      83.3+/-6.7%, p=0.05), but a significant part of patients (10 of 25) complained
      the appearance of heartburn after the start of the treatment. In conclusion, the 
      consumption of the functional drink containing inulin, menthol and pyridoxine is 
      associated with improve in stool parameters, abdominal pain, Bristol scale index 
      and increase in quality of life in patients with IBS-C, but produce noticeable
      heartburn. Changes in functional drink composition are needed to reduce adverse
      effects.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Celiac Disease Patients on a Long-Term Gluten-Free
      Diet.
LID - 10.3390/nu8070429 [doi]
LID - E429 [pii]
AB  - Experience suggests that many celiac patients suffer from persistent symptoms
      despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). We investigated the prevalence and
      severity of these symptoms in patients with variable duration of GFD. Altogether,
      856 patients were classified into untreated (n = 128), short-term GFD (1-2 years,
      n = 93) and long-term GFD (>/=3 years, n = 635) groups. Analyses were made of
      clinical and histological data and dietary adherence. Symptoms were evaluated by 
      the validated GSRS questionnaire. One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects comprised
      the control group. Further, the severity of symptoms was compared with that in
      peptic ulcer, reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Altogether, 93% of the short-term and 94% of the long-term 
      treated patients had a strict GFD and recovered mucosa. Untreated patients had
      more diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain than those on GFD and controls.
      There were no differences in symptoms between the short- and long-term GFD
      groups, but both yielded poorer GSRS total score than controls (p = 0.03 and p = 
      0.05, respectively). Furthermore, patients treated 1-2 years had more diarrhea (p
      = 0.03) and those treated >10 years more reflux (p = 0.04) than controls.
      Long-term treated celiac patients showed relatively mild symptoms compared with
      other gastrointestinal diseases. Based on our results, good response to GFD
      sustained in long-term follow-up, but not all patients reach the level of healthy
      individuals.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: low-FODMAP rye bread vs. regular rye bread to relieve 
      the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 460-70
LID - 10.1111/apt.13726 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Grains are high in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides 
      And Polyols) and often considered as triggers of IBS symptoms. AIM: To evaluate
      if rye bread low in FODMAPs would be better tolerated than regular rye bread in
      subjects with IBS. METHODS: The study was conducted as a randomised double blind 
      controlled cross-over study (n = 87). Participants were supplied with both
      regular rye bread and low-FODMAP rye bread for 4 weeks. Symptoms were measured
      with a symptom severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) 
      assessments of individual symptoms. Quality of life was monitored. Colonic
      fermentation was measured by the breath hydrogen test and dietary intake by food 
      diaries. RESULTS: Dietary fibre intake increased during both study periods
      compared to baseline. Many signs of IBS i.e. flatulence, abdominal pain, cramps
      and stomach rumbling were milder on the low-FODMAP rye bread (P-values: 0.04;
      0.049; 0.01 and 0.001). The mean of VAS measurements was favourable towards LF
      bread [-3 (95% CI): -6 to -1, P = 0.02] but no differences were detected in
      IBS-SSS or quality of life. The AUC of breath hydrogen values was significantly
      lower during the low-FODMAP bread period (median 52.9 vs. 72.6; P = 0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-FODMAP rye bread helps IBS patients to control their symptoms
      and reduces gastrointestinal gas accumulation. However, replacing regular rye
      bread by low-FODMAP bread without concomitant broader dietary changes does not
      improve quality of life or IBS-SSS. Nonetheless, inclusion of low-FODMAP rye
      bread in diet might be one way that IBS patients could increase their fibre
      intake.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: the efficacy of gut-directed hypnotherapy is similar
      to that of the low FODMAP diet for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 447-59
LID - 10.1111/apt.13706 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet is effective in treating irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). AIM: To compare the effects of gut-directed hypnotherapy to the low FODMAP
      diet on gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological indices, and assess additive 
      effects. METHODS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients were randomised
      (computer-generated list), to receive hypnotherapy, diet or a combination.
      Primary end-point: change in overall gastrointestinal symptoms across the three
      groups from baseline to week 6. Secondary end-points: changes in psychological
      indices, and the durability of effects over 6 months. RESULTS: Of 74
      participants, 25 received hypnotherapy, 24 diet and 25 combination. There were no
      demographic differences at baseline across groups. Improvements in overall
      symptoms were observed from baseline to week 6 for hypnotherapy [mean difference 
      (95% CI): -33 (-41 to -25)], diet [-30 (-42 to -19)] and combination [-36 (-45 to
      -27)] with no difference across groups (P = 0.67). This represented >/=20 mm
      improvement on visual analogue scale in 72%, 71% and 72%, respectively. This
      improvement relative to baseline symptoms was maintained 6 months post-treatment 
      in 74%, 82% and 54%. Individual gastrointestinal symptoms similarly improved.
      Hypnotherapy resulted in superior improvements on psychological indices with mean
      change from baseline to 6 months in State Trait Personality Inventory trait
      anxiety of -4(95% CI -6 to -2) P < 0.0001; -1(-3 to 0.3) P = ns; and 0.3(-2 to 2)
      P = ns, and in trait depression of -3(-5 to -0.7) P = 0.011; -0.8(-2 to 0.2) P = 
      ns; and 0.6(-2 to 3) P = ns, respectively. Groups improved similarly for QOL (all
      p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Durable effects of gut-directed hypnotherapy are
      similar to those of the low FODMAP diet for relief of gastrointestinal symptoms. 
      Hypnotherapy has superior efficacy to the diet on psychological indices. No
      additive effects were observed.

PG  - 41
LID - 10.1007/s11894-016-0517-x [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the best studied of the functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. It is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by
      symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and disordered bowel habits, which may
      include constipation, diarrhea, or both. IBS has a significant negative impact on
      patients, both financially and with regard to their quality-of-life. At present, 
      there is no cure for IBS, and while there are a number of pharmacological
      therapies available to treat IBS symptoms, they are not uniformly effective. For 
      this reason, many patients and providers are turning to dietary interventions in 
      an attempt to ameliorate IBS symptoms. At first glance, this approach appears
      reasonable as dietary interventions are generally safe and side effects,
      including potential adverse reactions with medications, are rare. However,
      although dietary interventions for IBS are frequently recommended, there is a
      paucity of data to support their use. The goals of this article are to answer key
      questions about diets currently recommended for the treatment of IBS, using the
      best available data from the literature.

TI  - A phase 1 study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and
      pharmacokinetics of tenapanor in healthy Japanese volunteers.
PG  - 407-416
LID - 10.1007/s10157-016-1302-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tenapanor (RDX5791, AZD1722), a small molecule with minimal systemic 
      availability, is an inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3). 
      Tenapanor acts locally in the gut to reduce absorption of sodium and phosphate.
      It is being developed for the treatment of patients with hyperphosphatemia in CKD
      requiring dialysis and patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. We report the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of
      tenapanor in Japanese volunteers. METHODS: In this phase 1, double-blind study
      (NCT02176252), healthy Japanese adults (aged 20-45 years) received single-dose
      tenapanor 180 mg (n = 6), repeated-dose tenapanor 15, 30, 60, or 90 mg twice
      daily (n = 12 each) for 7 days, or placebo (n = 14). All participants received a 
      standardized diet. RESULTS: Single and repeated doses of tenapanor resulted in
      higher mean stool sodium content vs. placebo (single dose, 41.9 mmol/day;
      repeated dose, range of means 21.3-32.2 mmol/day; placebo, 4.1 mmol/day)
      accompanied by lower urinary sodium content (single dose, 110 mmol/day; repeated 
      dose, 101-112 mmol/day; placebo, 143 mmol/day). Additionally, stool phosphorus
      content was increased (single dose, 31.0 mmol/day; repeated dose, 17.6-24.8
      mmol/day; placebo, 16.8 mmol/day) and urinary phosphorus content decreased
      (single dose, 18.7 mmol/day; repeated dose, 15.3-19.4 mmol/day; placebo, 25.5
      mmol/day). Tenapanor had minimal systemic exposure, provided a softer stool
      consistency, and was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Tenapanor treatment reduced
      absorption of intestinal sodium and phosphate from the gut in Japanese adults.
      Tenapanor had minimal systemic exposure and was well tolerated. Further research 
      into the clinical benefits of tenapanor is warranted.

PG  - 13-7
AB  - The common presentation of coeliac disease has shifted from the historically
      classical symptoms of malabsorption in childhood to non-classical symptoms in
      adulthood such as irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms, anaemia, chronic
      fatigue, change in bowel habit, abdominal pain and osteoporosis. A combination of
      coeliac serology and duodenal biopsy is required to diagnose coeliac disease in
      adults. Testing for IgA-tissue transglutaminase antibodies should be carried out 
      as a first-line screening test. Advise patients to eat a gluten-containing diet
      for six weeks before their investigations to ensure the serological and
      histological results are not affected. A confirmatory duodenal biopsy is
      mandatory to ensure that patients are correctly diagnosed with coeliac disease. A
      lifelong strict gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment currently
      available. All patients should be referred to a specialist dietitian for guidance
      and support. Annual follow-up can begin when the disease is stable and patients
      are managing well on their diet.

TI  - Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome report increased eating-associated
      symptoms, changes in dietary composition, and altered eating behaviors: a pilot
      comparison study to healthy adolescents.
PG  - 1915-1920
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About half of adult irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report
      symptoms with eating and disordered eating habits. However, little is known about
      eating in adolescent IBS patients, a common age at which eating disorders
      develop. The aim of the study was to investigate if adolescents with IBS are more
      likely than healthy controls (HCs) to experience eating-associated symptoms
      (EAS), report disordered eating patterns, and show differences in diet
      composition. METHODS: A total of 99 adolescents between 15 and 21 years-of-age
      participated (n = 48 IBS; n = 51 HCs). All subjects completed three 24-h dietary 
      recalls and questionnaires on EAS and disordered eating. KEY RESULTS: IBS
      patients were more likely to report EASs than HC (91.7% vs 28%, p < 0.001).
      Eating-associated symptoms were controlled by avoiding the offending food
      (97.7%), not eating any food even when hungry (43.2%), or vomiting after eating
      (13.6%). Compared to HC, IBS patients reported reduced daily intake of overall
      calories (1828 vs 2139; p < 0.05), fat (65.4 g vs 81.4 g, p < 0.05), and lactose 
      (8.2 g vs 12.8 g, p < 0.01). No differences were found between IBS and HC in
      screening for disordered eating patterns or BMI, though IBS patients endorsed
      using potentially unhealthy eating behaviors in an attempt to control symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Eating-associated symptoms are very common in
      adolescents with IBS and associated with changes in eating behaviors and dietary 
      composition. They do not appear to change BMI and risk for eating disorders. More
      research is needed to guide adolescents with IBS in making appropriate dietary
      changes to control EASs.

TI  - Nonceliac gluten sensitivity: an approach to diagnosis and management.
PG  - 638-43
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000392 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Symptoms attributed to gluten consumption are frequently
      reported evoking the need for differentiating nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)
      from other gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and wheat allergy.
      This review discusses diagnostic criteria and research to date on the
      pathogenesis and diagnosis of NCGS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is recent evidence to 
      support NCGS as a distinct clinical entity. The symptoms attributed to NCGS are
      nonspecific, overlapping with those reported in patients with celiac disease and 
      irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast to celiac disease and wheat allergy, the
      diagnosis of NCGS is more challenging because there are no specific clinical
      biomarkers and because the pathogenesis of NCGS is largely not well understood.
      The pathogenesis of NCGS may reflect alterations in innate immunity to gluten or 
      other components of wheat, may be linked with autoimmunity, or is a result of a
      reaction to gluten as a fermentable carbohydrate. SUMMARY: NCGS is a newly
      characterized and evolving clinical entity that requires ruling out other causes 
      of wheat-related or gluten-related gastrointestinal symptoms, including celiac
      disease and wheat allergy, coupled with double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
      challenge with gluten.

TI  - Dietary patterns and prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in Iranian adults.
PG  - 1921-1933
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several dietary factors have been reported to alleviate or
      aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), no information is
      available linking habitual dietary patterns to irritable bowel syndrome.
      OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the association between dietary
      patterns and the risk of IBS among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, data on 3846 Iranian adults working in 50 different health
      centers were examined. Dietary intake of study participants was assessed using a 
      106-item self-administered Dish-based Semi-quantitative Food Frequency
      Questionnaire (DS-FFQ) which was designed and validated specifically for Iranian 
      adults. To identify major dietary patterns based on the 39 food groups, we used
      principal component analysis. A modified Persian version of the Rome III
      questionnaire was used for assessment of IBS. RESULTS: We identified four major
      dietary patterns: (i) 'fast food', (ii) 'traditional', (iii) 'lacto-vegetarian', 
      and (iv) 'western' dietary pattern. After adjustment for potential confounders,
      we found that those in the highest quartile of 'fast food' dietary pattern were
      tended to have higher risk of IBS than those in the lowest quartile (OR = 1.32;
      95% CI: 0.99, 1.75, ptrend = 0.05). An inverse association was also found between
      'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern and risk of IBS; such that even after
      adjustment for potential confounders, those in top quartile of this dietary
      pattern were 24% less likely to have IBS (0.76; 0.59, 0.98; ptrend = 0.02). No
      overall significant associations were observed between 'traditional' and
      'western' dietary patterns and risk of IBS, either before or after adjustment for
      covariates. CONCLUSION: We found that 'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern was
      associated with reduced risk, while 'fast food' dietary pattern was associated
      with a greater risk of IBS in Iranian adults.

      sufficiently explored?].
PG  - 821-6
LID - 10.1007/s00103-016-2366-z [doi]
AB  - The avoidance of wheat, gluten and other cereal products is a growing phenomenon 
      in industrialized countries. The diagnostic criteria of celiac disease and of
      food allergy to wheat flour and/or other cereals are clearly defined. Only about 
      0.5-25 % of the population are affected from both of these immunological
      diseases.Nevertheless, there exists a significantly greater proportion of people 
      reporting at least subjectively significant complaints and quality of life
      improvements after switching to a wheat- or gluten-free diet. Celiac disease or
      wheat allergy cannot be detected in these individuals on the basis of established
      criteria. The absence of clear diagnostic autoimmune or allergic criteria in
      these wheat sensitive patients has resulted in the description of non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity.It is clinically detectable in only very few individuals and
      may manifest with either intestinal, extra-intestinal or neurovegetative and
      psychosomatic symptoms, respectively. However, non-celiac disease gluten
      sensitivity has to be differentiated critically from irritable bowel syndrome,
      carbohydrate malassimilation, postinfectious conditions and psychosomatic
      diseases.Pathophysiologically, non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity is still
      poorly characterized; several non-immunological mechanisms are discussed to
      contribute to non-celiac gluten sensitivity. These include the effects of fructo-
      and galacto-oligosaccharides, of trypsin inhibitors of amylase, and wheat lectin 
      agglutinins, which may influence or modulate intestinal permeability and/or a
      non-specific immune or effector cell degranulation within the gastrointestinal
      tract. In addition, further metabolic effects with direct or indirect influence
      on the intestinal flora are currently discussed.In addition to subjectively
      reported changes in symptoms that may affect variably intestinal, as well as
      extra-intestinal and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms, some studies suggest that
      there is little reproducibility of complaints from gluten exposure. For a
      definitive diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, structured (blinded)
      challenge tests with wheat or gluten are mandatory as well as re-challenge after 
      a defined time of gluten avoidance to establish non-celiac disease gluten
      sensitivity as a persistent disease entity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently identify foods 
      as exacerbating their gastrointestinal symptoms. In children with IBS, the
      prevalence of perceived food intolerances and their impact are unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of self-perceived food
      intolerances and the relationship of these intolerances to abdominal pain,
      psychosocial distress, and quality of life in children with IBS. DESIGN: We
      conducted a cross-sectional study. Questionnaire and prospective diary data were 
      collected from 2008 to 2014 by trained research coordinators.
      PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were children 7 to 18 years old (pediatric
      Rome III IBS, n=154; age-sex matched healthy children, n=32) in Houston, TX.
      MEASURES: Perceived food intolerances and avoided foods were captured using the
      Childhood Food and Symptom Association Questionnaire. IBS severity was assessed
      by a >/=7-day pain diary and validated psychosocial questionnaires assessing
      quality of life, somatization, functional disability, depression, and anxiety.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: We used descriptive Spearman bivariate
      correlation, chi(2), and Poisson log-linear generalized model with Wald chi(2)
      statistics. RESULTS: A greater proportion of children with IBS (143 of 154
      [92.9%]) vs healthy children (20 of 32 [62.5%]) identified at least one
      self-perceived food intolerance (chi(2)=22.5; P<0.001). Children with IBS
      identified a greater number (median=4 [25% to 75% quartile=2 to 6]) of perceived 
      symptom-inducing foods than healthy children (median=2 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to 
      4]; chi(2)=28.6; P<0.001). Children with IBS avoided more foods (median=2 [25% to
      75% quartile=1 to 4]) than healthy children (median=0 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to
      2.75]; chi(2)=20.8; P<0.001). The number of self-perceived food intolerances was 
      weakly associated (r value range= -0.17 to 0.21) with pain frequency, pain
      severity, somatization, anxiety, functional disability, and decreased quality of 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBS have a high prevalence of self-perceived
      food intolerances. The number of these intolerances is weakly associated with
      measures of IBS severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the gut have been suggested to
      have a beneficial effect on stress response and depressive disorder. We examined 
      whether these bacterial counts are reduced in patients with major depressive
      disorder (MDD) than in healthy controls. METHOD: Bifidobacterium and
      Lactobacillus counts in fecal samples were estimated in 43 patients and 57
      controls using bacterial rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction RESULTS: The patients had significantly lower
      Bifidobacterium counts (P=0.012) and tended to have lower Lactobacillus counts
      (P=0.067) than the controls. Individuals whose bacterial counts below the optimal
      cut-off point (9.53 and 6.49log10 cells/g for Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, 
      respectively) were significantly more common in the patients than in the controls
      for both bacteria (Bifidobacterium: odds ratio 3.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.38-7.54, P=0.010; Lactobacillus: 2.57, 95% CI 1.14-5.78, P=0.027). Using the
      same cut-off points, we observed an association between the bacterial counts and 
      Irritable bowel syndrome. Frequency of fermented milk consumption was associated 
      with higher Bifidobacterium counts in the patients. LIMITATIONS: The findings
      should be interpreted with caution since effects of gender and diet were not
      fully taken into account in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results provide direct 
      evidence, for the first time, that individuals with lower Bifidobacterium and/or 
      Lactobacillus counts are more common in patients with MDD compared to controls.
      Our findings provide new insight into the pathophysiology of MDD and will enhance
      future research on the use of pro- and prebiotics in the treatment of MDD.

TI  - Does Education Have Any Influence on Symptom Score of IBS Patients: A Randomized 
      Controlled Study.
PG  - 334-9
AB  - Despite much research, the pathophysiology of IBS remains poorly understood. So
      it is very difficult to treat. There is no standard treatment for IBS. Because
      IBS symptoms can be elicited or exacerbated by diet and stress, this suggests
      that patient education regarding his or her illness might be beneficial to
      patients in managing their symptoms. This study was done to see the short term
      effects of outpatient education in relation to change of symptom score in IBS
      patients. This is a prospective randomized comparative study. In this study a
      total of 80 patients were included. Forty patients were given only
      pharmacological management with Mebevarine hydrochloride 135mg thrice daily half 
      an hour before meal and Amitryptline 10mg at night for six months and another
      forty were given education in addition to the same pharmacological treatment. In 
      both the study group [medical management only versus medical management with
      education] changes of symptoms and quality of life of patients of IBS were
      assessed by using previously used, specially designed symptoms scoring system and
      a validated IBS-QOL instrument. There was no significant difference in severity
      of symptoms between only drug treatment group (118.973) and education plus drug
      treatment group (119.57) before treatment. The difference of improvement between 
      the education group and without education group was not statistically significant
      (P>0.05), though the subsidence of pain in both the group before and after
      treatment was statistically significant (P<0.01).

TI  - British Dietetic Association systematic review and evidence-based practice
      guidelines for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016
      update).
PG  - 549-75
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines for the
      dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults were published in 
      2012. Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this work
      was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the management 
      of IBS and to update the guidelines. METHODS: Twelve questions relating to diet
      and IBS were defined based on review of the previous guideline questions, current
      evidence and clinical practice. Chosen topics were on healthy eating and
      lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, elimination diets, fat and fluid
      intakes and dietary habits), milk and dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable
      carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and elimination diets/food hypersensitivity.
      Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase,
      Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to October 2015. Studies were assessed
      independently in duplicate using risk of bias tools specific to each included
      study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for each question. National
      Health and Medical Research Council grading evidence levels were used to develop 
      evidence statements and recommendations, in accordance with Practice-based
      Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the BDA. RESULTS: Eighty-six
      studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence statements, 15 clinical
      recommendations and four research recommendations. The IBS dietary algorithm was 
      simplified to first-line (healthy eating, provided by any healthcare
      professional) and second-line [low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) to be provided by dietitian] dietary 
      advice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide updated comprehensive
      evidence-based details to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS in
      adults.

      irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016 update).
PG  - 576-92
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are often taken by individuals with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Which products are effective is unclear, despite an increasing
      research base. This project will systematically review which strain- and dose-
      specific probiotics can be recommended to adults with IBS to improve symptoms and
      quality of life (QoL). It is part of a broader systematic review to update
      British Dietetic Association guidelines for the dietary management of IBS in
      adults. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science
      were searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trial (RCT)s 
      recruiting adults with IBS comparing probiotic intervention with placebo. AMSTAR,
      risk of bias and diet bias tools were used to appraise methodological quality.
      Symptom and QoL data were appraised to develop probiotic-specific evidence
      statements on clinically meaningful and marginal outcomes in various settings,
      graded clinical practice recommendations and practical considerations. RESULTS:
      Nine systematic reviews and 35 RCTs were included (3406 participants) using 29
      dose-specific probiotic formulations. None of the RCTs were at low risk of bias. 
      Twelve out of 29 probiotics (41%) showed no symptom or QoL benefits. Evidence
      indicated that no strain or dose specific probiotic was consistently effective to
      improve any IBS symptoms or QoL. Two general clinical practice recommendations
      were made. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom outcomes for dose-specific probiotics were
      heterogeneous. Specific probiotic recommendations for IBS management in adults
      were not possible at this time. More data from high-quality RCTs treating
      specific symptom profiles are needed to support probiotic therapy in the
      management of IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is probably the most common functional gastrointestinal 
      disorder and is characterized by abdominal pain along with altered bowel
      function. It is a disorder of female predominance. This article focuses on how
      being female influences the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and treatment

AB  - In this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic
      approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the
      confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. 
      Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a
      significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of
      life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel
      syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in
      association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension.
      Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel
      movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of
      incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are
      therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and 
      pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond
      similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or 
      absence of pain, albeit not in an "all or nothing" manner. Severity depends not
      only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors
      (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of
      involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders
      are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been 
      made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016,
      and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between
      Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available
      treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods,
      fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating
      laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence,
      prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants,
      psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation,
      surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of 
      them.

AB  - AIM: To investigate patient-reported outcomes from, and adherence to, a low
      FODMAP diet among patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome and
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Consecutive patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and co-existing IBS fulfilling
      the ROME III criteria, who previously attended an outpatient clinic for low
      FODMAP diet (LFD) dietary management and assessment by a gastroenterologist, were
      invited to participate in a retrospective questionnaire analysis. The
      questionnaires were sent and returned by regular mail and gathered information on
      recall of dietary treatment, efficacy, symptoms, adherence, satisfaction, change 
      in disease course and stool type, and quality of life. Before study enrolment all
      patients had to sign an informed written consent. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty
      patients were included, 131 (73%) IBS and 49 (27%) IBD patients. Median age was
      43 years (range: 18-85) and 147 (82%) were females. Median follow-up time was 16 
      mo (range: 2-80). Eighty-six percent reported either partial (54%) or full (32%) 
      efficacy with greatest improvement of bloating (82%) and abdominal pain (71%).
      The proportion of patients with full efficacy tended to be greater in the IBD
      group than in the IBS group (42% vs 29%, P = 0.08). There was a significant
      reduction in patients with a chronic continuous disease course in both the IBS
      group (25%, P < 0.001) and IBD group (23%, P = 0.002) along with a significant
      increase in patients with a mild indolent disease course of 37% (P < 0.001) and
      23% (P = 0.002), respectively. The proportion of patients having normal stools
      increased with 41% in the IBS group (P < 0.001) and 66% in the IBD group (P <
      0.001). One-third of patients adhered to the diet and high adherence was
      associated with longer duration of dietary course (P < 0.001). Satisfaction with 
      dietary management was seen in 83 (70%) IBS patients and 24 (55%) IBD patients.
      Eighty-four percent of patients lived on a modified LFD, where some foods rich in
      FODMAPs were reintroduced, and 16% followed the LFD by the book without
      deviations. Wheat, dairy products, and onions were the foods most often not
      reintroduced by patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a diet low in
      FODMAPs is an efficacious treatment solution in the management of functional
      bowel symptoms for IBS and IBD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum of gastroenterology-related diseases related to obesity 
      is growing. Few clinical tools exist to aid in clinician-guided dietary
      counseling. GOALS: (1) Develop and validate a 1-page diet history form that would
      provide information on dietary factors that can contribute to gastrointestinal
      (GI) illness and to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet; and (2) evaluate 
      the form in a general GI clinic to determine its potential utility as a clinical 
      tool. STUDY: A 1-page diet history form was developed and underwent qualitative
      and quantitative validation in comparison to a formal diet evaluation by a
      registered dietitian. The form was then evaluated in consecutive patients
      attending a general GI clinic, and analyzed for overall diet content, compliance 
      with a Mediterranean diet, and presence of high-risk (red flag) dietary
      behaviors. RESULTS: The form was evaluated in 134 patients. In a validation
      cohort (n=30) the qualitative dietary components measured were highly concordant 
      with a formal dietary interview. Total daily calorie intake correlated with
      formal dietary review (R=0.61), but tended to underestimate total calories due to
      less precision in portion size. The prospective cohort (n=104) patients had a
      mean body mass index of 29.8. Overall, 52.9% were obese, 50% had metabolic
      syndrome, and 51% had a primary GI illness directly impacted by dietary factors
      (gastroesophageal reflux, irritable bowel, fatty liver). Overall, 85.6% of
      patients documented red flag behaviors. Patients with obesity trended for more
      red flags than overweight or normal body mass index groups. CONCLUSION: A 1-page 
      diet questionnaire correlated well with formal dietary assessment and identified 
      clinically relevant dietary interventions in a high percentage of GI patients.

TI  - Psyllium Fiber Reduces Abdominal Pain in Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      in a Randomized, Double-Blind Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to determine the efficacy of psyllium fiber
      treatment on abdominal pain and stool patterns in children with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We evaluated effects on breath hydrogen and methane production,
      gut permeability, and microbiome composition. We also investigated whether
      psychological characteristics of children or parents affected the response to
      treatment. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of 103 children
      (mean age, 13 +/- 3 y) with IBS seen at primary or tertiary care settings. After 
      2 weeks on their habitual diet, children began an 8-day diet excluding
      carbohydrates thought to cause symptoms of IBS. Children with >/=75% improvement 
      in abdominal pain were excluded (n = 17). Children were assigned randomly to
      groups given psyllium (n = 37) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 47) for 6 weeks.
      Two-week pain and stool diaries were compared at baseline and during the final 2 
      weeks of treatment. We assessed breath hydrogen and methane production,
      intestinal permeability, and the composition of the microbiome before and after
      administration of psyllium or placebo. Psychological characteristics of children 
      were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Children in the psyllium group had a greater 
      reduction in the mean number of pain episodes than children in the placebo group 
      (mean reduction of 8.2 +/- 1.2 after receiving psyllium vs mean reduction of 4.1 
      +/- 1.3 after receiving placebo; P = .03); the level of pain intensity did not
      differ between the groups. Psychological characteristics were not associated with
      response. At the end of the study period, the percentage of stools that were
      normal (Bristol scale scores, 3-5), breath hydrogen or methane production,
      intestinal permeability, and microbiome composition were similar between groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium fiber reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes in
      children with IBS, independent of psychological factors. Psyllium did not alter
      breath hydrogen or methane production, gut permeability, or microbiome
      composition. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00526903.

AB  - The recent development of advanced sequencing techniques has revealed the
      complexity and diverse functions of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, alterations 
      in the composition or balance of the intestinal microbiota, or dysbiosis, are
      associated with many gastrointestinal diseases. The looming question is whether
      dysbiosis is a cause or effect of these diseases. In this review, we will
      evaluate the contribution of intestinal microbiota in obesity, fatty liver,
      inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Promising results from 
      microbiota or metabolite transfer experiments in animals suggest the microbiota
      may be sufficient to reproduce disease features in the appropriate host in
      certain disorders. Less compelling causal associations may reflect complex,
      multi-factorial disease pathogenesis, in which dysbiosis is a necessary
      condition. Understanding the contributions of the microbiota in GI diseases
      should offer novel insight into disease pathophysiology and deliver new treatment
      strategies such as therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of chronic constipation in adults.
PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2016.53 [doi]
AB  - Constipation is a heterogeneous, polysymptomatic, multifactorial disease. Acute
      or transient constipation can be due to changes in diet, travel or stress, and
      secondary constipation can result from drug treatment, neurological or metabolic 
      conditions or, rarely, colon cancer. A diagnosis of primary chronic constipation 
      is made after exclusion of secondary causes of constipation and encompasses
      several overlapping subtypes. Slow-transit constipation is characterized by
      prolonged colonic transit in the absence of pelvic floor dysfunction. This
      subtype of constipation can be identified using either the radio-opaque marker
      test or wireless motility capsule test, and is best treated with laxatives such
      as polyethylene glycol or newer agents such as linaclotide or lubiprostone. If
      unsuccessful, subspecialist referral should be considered. Dyssynergic defecation
      results from impaired coordination of rectoanal and pelvic floor muscles, and
      causes difficulty with defecation. The condition can be identified using
      anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion tests and is best managed with
      biofeedback therapy. Opioid-induced constipation is an emerging entity, and
      several drugs including naloxegol, methylnaltrexone and lubiprostone are approved
      for its treatment. In this Review, we provide an overview of the burden and
      pathophysiology of chronic constipation, as well as a detailed discussion of the 
      available diagnostic tools and treatment options.

TI  - Changes in small intestinal chromogranin A-immunoreactive cell densities in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome after receiving dietary guidance.
PG  - 1247-53
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2016.2523 [doi]
AB  - Chromogranin A (CgA) is a common marker for enteroendocrine cells in the gut, and
      CgA-immunoreactive cell densities are abnormal in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). The majority of patients with IBS report that their symptoms
      develop after consuming certain foodstuffs. In the present study, we investigated
      the effects of dietary guidance on the total enteroendocrine cell densities in
      the small intestine, as detected by CgA. A total of 14 patients with IBS
      underwent a gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies and 11 of them also underwent a
      colonoscopy, with biopsy samples obtained from the ileum. Fourteen control
      subjects were also included. Each patient received 3 sessions of dietary
      guidance. Gastroscopies and colonoscopies were performed on both the controls and
      patients with IBS (at baseline and at 3-9 months after receiving guidance).
      Biopsy samples obtained from the duodenum and ileum were immunostained for CgA
      using the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method and were quantified using
      computerized image analysis. The density of CgA-immunoreactive cells in the
      duodenum (mean +/- SEM values) in the control subjects was 235.9 +/- 31.9
      cells/mm2; in the patients with IBS, the density was 36.9 +/- 9.8 and 103.7 +/-
      16.9 cells/mm2 before and after they received dietary guidance, respectively
      (P=0.007). The density of CgA-immunoreactive cells in the ileum in the control
      subjects was 47.4 +/- 8.3 cells/mm2; in the patients with IBS, the density was
      48.4 +/- 8.1 and 17.9 +/- 4.4 cells/mm2, before and after they received dietary
      guidance, respectively (P=0.0006). These data indicate that changes in
      CgA-immunoreactive cell densities in patients with IBS after receiving dietary
      guidance may reflect a change in the densities of the small intestinal
      enteroendocrine cells, which may contribute to an improvement in the IBS
      symptoms.

TI  - FODMAPs alter symptoms and the metabolome of patients with IBS: a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1241-1251
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-311339 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain mechanistic insights, we compared effects of low fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) and high
      FODMAP diets on symptoms, the metabolome and the microbiome of patients with IBS.
      DESIGN: We performed a controlled, single blind study of patients with IBS (Rome 
      III criteria) randomised to a low (n=20) or high (n=20) FODMAP diet for 3 weeks. 
      Symptoms were assessed using the IBS symptom severity scoring (IBS-SSS). The
      metabolome was evaluated using the lactulose breath test (LBT) and metabolic
      profiling in urine using mass spectrometry. Stool microbiota composition was
      analysed by 16S rRNA gene profiling. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (19 low
      FODMAP; 18 high FODMAP) completed the 3-week diet. The IBS-SSS was reduced in the
      low FODMAP diet group (p<0.001) but not the high FODMAP group. LBTs showed a
      minor decrease in H2 production in the low FODMAP compared with the high FODMAP
      group. Metabolic profiling of urine showed groups of patients with IBS differed
      significantly after the diet (p<0.01), with three metabolites (histamine,
      p-hydroxybenzoic acid, azelaic acid) being primarily responsible for
      discrimination between the two groups. Histamine, a measure of immune activation,
      was reduced eightfold in the low FODMAP group (p<0.05). Low FODMAP diet increased
      Actinobacteria richness and diversity, and high FODMAP diet decreased the
      relative abundance of bacteria involved in gas consumption. CONCLUSIONS: IBS
      symptoms are linked to FODMAP content and associated with alterations in the
      metabolome. In subsets of patients, FODMAPs modulate histamine levels and the
      microbiota, both of which could alter symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:
      NCT01829932.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the publication in 2009 of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and 
      Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome of the Asociacion Mexicana de
      Gastroenterologia (2009 Guidelines), there have been significant advances in our 
      knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this 
      disease. AIMS: To present a consensus review of the most current knowledge of
      IBS, updating the 2009 Guidelines by incorporating new internationally published 
      scientific evidence, with a special interest in Mexican studies. METHODS: The
      PubMed literature from January 2009 to March 2015 was reviewed and complemented
      through a manual search. Articles in English and Spanish were included and
      preference was given to consensuses, guidelines, systematic reviews, and
      meta-analyses. Statements referring to the different aspects of the disease were 
      formulated and voted upon by 24 gastroenterologists employing the Delphi method. 
      Once a consensus on each statement was reached, the quality of evidence and
      strength of recommendation were determined through the GRADE system. RESULTS:
      Forty-eight statements were formulated, updating the information on IBS and
      adding the complementary data that did not appear in the 2009 Guidelines
      regarding the importance of exercise and diet, diagnostic strategies, and current
      therapy alternatives that were analyzed with more stringent scientific vigor or
      that emerged within the last 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We present herein a consensus 
      review of the most relevant advances in the study of IBS, updating and
      complementing the 2009 Guidelines. Several studies conducted in Mexico were
      included.

PG  - 130-7
LID - 10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.3.130 [doi]
AB  - This article describes the conclusions of an expert panel that discussed four
      case studies; these were examples of patients typically encountered by nurses
      working in the community. The panel considered the nutritional and lifestyle
      advice that could be given by nurses relating to conditions such as irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, vulnerability to
      common infections, elderly care, recurrent urinary tract infection, antibiotic
      use, and risk of type 2 diabetes. A general conclusion was the importance of
      motivational interviewing techniques in achieving full understanding of patients'
      concerns and to determine the best health strategy. As well as specific guidance 
      appropriate for each disorder, a range of information sources for both health
      professionals and patients are listed in the paper. The panel noted that,
      although general nutritional advice can be given by nurses working at GP
      surgeries and in the community, patients should always be referred to registered 
      dietitians or nutritionists if significant dietary changes are considered.

TI  - Celiac Disease in Patients Fulfilling the Rome III Criteria for Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome Attending Gastroenterology Department of A Tertiary Care Hospital in
      Bangladesh.
PG  - 102-8
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that
      substantially affects patients' quality of life and is associated with a
      considerable drain of health-care resources and economic burden. But some IBS
      patients may have celiac disease that could be treated by gluten-free diet which 
      will subsequently improve their quality of life. This study was done to see the
      prevalence of celiac disease among the IBS patients fulfilling Rome III criteria.
      The present cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of
      Gastroenterology at BSMMU, Dhaka from July 2010 to September 2011. A total of 107
      patients aged ranging between 16-60 years clinically labeled as IBS and fulfilled
      Rome III criteria were included as study sample. The test statistics used to
      analyze the data were descriptive statistics. The mean age of the patients was
      31.5+/-10.3 years and male to female ratio was roughly 6:1. The mean duration of 
      IBS was 32.0+/-2.1 months. All of the patients had abdominal discomfort or pain
      in the preceding 6 months and had a history of loose (mushy) or watery stool,
      99.1% had pain or discomfort relieved with defaecation. The prevalence of
      diarrhoea was found in 78.5% and mixed 21.5% of the patients. About 5% of the
      patients had raised ESR and majority (86.9%) of the patients had normal level of 
      hemoglobin. Ten (9%) of 107 patients were found positive for anti-t TG (IgA).
      These findings suggest that an around one-tenth of IBS especially diarrhoea
      predominant patients may have celiac disease who will respond to simple
      gluten-free diet thus minimizing the morbidity and mortality. So, all clinically 
      diagnosed IBS patients especially diarrhoea predominant cases should be suggested
      for the screening for celiac disease.

TI  - Fermentable Carbohydrate Restriction (Low FODMAP Diet) in Clinical Practice
      Improves Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.
PG  - 1129-36
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) experience functional-like gastrointestinal symptoms (FGS) even during
      remission. Research suggests that dietary restriction of fermentable
      carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, 
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet) can improve FGS, albeit in irritable bowel syndrome.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet
      delivered in routine clinical practice in patients with IBD and coexisting FGS.
      METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptom scores were compared in consecutive patients
      with IBD referred for low FODMAP dietary education for symptom management (n =
      88). Symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale, and
      stool output was assessed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale at both baseline and
      follow-up (minimum of 6 weeks). RESULTS: There was a significant and large
      increase in the numbers of patients reporting satisfactory relief of symptoms
      between baseline (14/88, 16%) and low FODMAP diet (69/88, 78%; P < 0.001).
      Following dietary intervention, there was also a significant decrease in severity
      for most symptoms and a reduction in composite symptom score (baseline mean: 1.2,
      SD: 0.5 versus low FODMAP diet mean: 0.7, SD: 0.5; P < 0.001). Improvements in
      stool consistency and frequency were observed, including an increase in "normal" 
      stool form (P = 0.002) and "normal" stool frequency (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      low FODMAP diet delivered in routine clinical practice seems effective in
      improving satisfaction with, and severity of, FGS in IBD. Randomized controlled
      trials are warranted to definitively establish effectiveness.

TI  - Altered gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome and its
      modification by diet: probiotics, prebiotics and the low FODMAP diet.
PG  - 306-18
LID - 10.1017/S0029665116000021 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by
      abdominal pain or discomfort with disordered defecation. This review describes
      the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and
      how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community.
      Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in
      IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which
      has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials 
      suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating 
      IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated
      effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel
      method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable
      carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical
      effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one
      unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the
      microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal
      Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction
      in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has
      clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration.
      Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the 
      complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both
      interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment
      has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for
      optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects
      on the GI microbiota.

AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

AB  - In 2015, besides the fact that it still fills the gastroenterologists' offices
      and impairs patient's quality of life, the irritable bowel syndrome has
      considerably evolved on several points. The pathophysiology is now organized
      around a consensual hypothesis called the "brain-gut axis", which gather all the 
      influences of peripheral factors as gut microbiota or local serotonin secretion, 
      on the central pain perception, contributing to visceral hypersensitivity and
      transit modifications. About the diagnosis, the key message is "avoid
      over-prescription" of additional tests, and reminds that a positive clinical
      diagnosis based on Rome III criteria is possible after the elimination of simple 
      clinical warning signs. Finally, the food component, a neglected and historical
      claim of patients, finally finds a strong scientific rational, with a diet low in
      fermentable sugar and polyols, that gives positive and reproducible results.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and
      function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent
      studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and
      to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut
      microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies
      underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and
      metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests 
      that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, 
      drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an
      adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early
      gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies
      using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have 
      yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use 
      is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric 
      disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in
      most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are
      anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut 
      microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for
      improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.

TI  - Evidence for the Presence of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in Patients with
      Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Results from a Multicenter Randomized
      Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Gluten Challenge.
PG  - 84

LID - E84 [pii]
AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by the onset of symptoms
      after eating gluten-containing food. We aimed to single out NCGS subjects among
      subjects with functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients were enrolled in a
      multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Symptoms and
      quality of life were evaluated by means of 10-cm VAS and SF36. Iron parameters,
      transaminases and C reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. After a
      three-week-long gluten-free diet (GFD), responsive patients were randomly
      assigned to gluten intake (5.6 g/day) or placebo for seven days, followed by
      crossover. The primary endpoint was the worsening of symptoms (VAS increase >/=3 
      cm) during gluten ingestion compared to placebo. One hundred and forty patients
      were enrolled and 134 (17 males, mean age 39.1 +/- 11.7 years, BMI 22.4 +/- 3.8) 
      completed the first period. A total of 101 subjects (10 males, mean age 39.3 +/- 
      11.0 years, BMI 22.3 +/- 4.0) reported a symptomatic improvement (VAS score 2.3
      +/- 1.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 before and after GFD, p = 0.001). 98 patients underwent
      the gluten challenge and 28 (all females, mean age 38.9 +/- 12.7 years, BMI 22.0 
      +/- 2.9) reported a symptomatic relapse and deterioration of quality of life. No 
      parameters were found to be statistically associated with positivity to the
      challenge. However, 14 patients responded to the placebo ingestion. Taking into
      account this finding, about 14% of patients responding to gluten withdrawal
      showed a symptomatic relapse during the gluten challenge. This group is suspected
      to have NCGS.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.12 [doi]
AB  - Food sits at the intersection between gastrointestinal (GI) physiology and
      symptoms in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is now clear
      that the majority of IBS sufferers associate eating a meal with their GI and
      non-GI symptoms. This is hardly surprising when one considers that food can
      affect a variety of physiologic factors (motility, visceral sensation, brain-gut 
      interactions, microbiome, permeability, immune activation, and neuro-endocrine
      function) relevant to the pathogenesis of IBS. In recent years, clinical research
      has increasingly focused on diet as a treatment for IBS. There is a relative
      paucity of data from rigorous, randomized, controlled trials for any dietary
      intervention in IBS patients. Currently, the largest body of literature has
      addressed the efficacy of dietary restriction of fermentable oligo, di,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In the future, dietary treatments for IBS
      will move beyond the current focus on elimination to embrace supplementation with
      "functional" foods.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and visceral hypersensitivity : risk factors and
      pathophysiological mechanisms.
PG  - 29-38
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastro-intestinal disorder,
      characterized by abdominal pain and altered intestinal motility. Visceral
      hypersensitivity is an important hallmark feature of IBS and is believed to
      underlie abdominal pain in patients with IBS. The two main risk factors
      associated with the development of IBS are gastrointestinal inflammation and
      psychological distress. On a peripheral level, visceral sensitivity seems to be
      modulated by several mechanisms. Immune cells in the mucosal wall, such as mast
      cells, and enterochromaffin cells may sensitize afferent nerves by release of
      their mediators. Furthermore, increased mucosal permeability, altered intestinal 
      microflora and dietary habits may contribute to this feature. On a central level,
      an increased prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities is demonstrated in IBS
      patients, alongside alterations in the hormonal brain-gut axis, increased
      vigilance towards intestinal stimuli and functional and structural changes in the
      brain. The pathogenesis of IBS is complicated and multifactorial and the
      treatment remains clinically challenging. Dietary measures and symptomatic
      control are the cornerstones for IBS treatment and may be sufficient for patients
      experiencing mild symptoms, alongside education, reassurance and an effective
      therapeutic physician-patient relationship. New pharmacological therapies are
      aimed at interfering with mediator release and/or blockade of the relevant
      receptors within the gut wall, while modulation of the intestinal flora and diet 
      may also be of therapeutic benefit. Tricyclic anti-depressants and serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors act both on a central and peripheral level by modulating pain
      signalling pathways.

AB  - Food is essential for life. Yet, poor food choices may cause poor health. Dietary
      manipulation is frequently integrated into the management of common chronic
      pediatric conditions. Parents seek dietary information to have more control over 
      child's condition and to avoid side effects of medicine. This article reviews
      selected diets for a few common pediatric disorders including eczema, attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, headache and migraine, non-celiac gluten
      sensitivity, and irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in diet low in FODMAPs
      (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) as an 
      important mainstay in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This model
      of diet was developed by a multidisciplinary team from the Monash University in
      Melbourne and became well-known after the publication of a study in 2008 showing 
      that dietary FODMAPs acted as causing factors in patients with IBS. Since then
      there have been several randomized controlled trials which, although with small
      sample sizes, have again shown the benefits of this dietary pattern.

TI  - From coeliac disease to noncoeliac gluten sensitivity; should everyone be gluten 
      free?
PG  - 120-7
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000248 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gluten-free diets (GFDs) have seen a disproportional rise in
      use and popularity relative to the prevalence of established gluten-related
      disorders such as coeliac disease or immunoglobulin E wheat allergy. This entity 
      has been termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). This review aims to provide
      a current perspective on the emerging evidence for and against NCGS, along with
      the associated need for a GFD. RECENT FINDINGS: NCGS and the benefits of a GFD
      are reported amongst patients with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel
      disease, and nonintestinal disorders such as neuropsychiatric diseases and
      fibromyalgia. However, no reliable biomarkers currently exist to diagnose NCGS
      and hence confirmatory testing can only be performed using double-blind
      placebo-controlled gluten-based challenges. Unfortunately, such tests are not
      available in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, recent novel studies have
      highlighted the role of other gluten-based components in contributing to the
      symptoms of self-reported NCGS. These include fermentable oligo, di,
      mono-saccharides and polyols, amylase trypsin inhibitors, and wheat germ
      agglutinins. Therefore, NCGS is now seen as a spectrum encompassing several
      biological responses and terms such as 'noncoeliac wheat sensitivity' have been
      suggested as a wider label to define the condition. SUMMARY: Despite the rising
      use of a GFD further studies are required to clearly establish the extent and
      exclusivity of gluten in NCGS.

TI  - Efficacy of a Gluten-Free Diet in Subjects With Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Diarrhea
      Unaware of Their HLA-DQ2/8 Genotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-containing diet alters bowel barrier function in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), particularly those 
      who are positive for HLA allele DQ2/8. We studied the effects of a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) in patients with IBS-D who have not previously considered the effects 
      of gluten in their diet and were unaware of their HLA-DQ2/8 genotype. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective study of 41 patients with IBS-D (20 HLA-DQ2/8-positive
      and 21 HLA-DQ2/8-negative) at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, United
      Kingdom, from September 2012 through July 2015. All subjects were placed on a
      6-week GFD following evaluation by a dietician. Subjects completed validated
      questionnaires at baseline and Week 6 of the GFD. The primary endpoint was mean
      change in IBS Symptom Severity Score; a 50-point reduction was considered to
      indicate a clinical response. Secondary endpoints were changes in hospital
      anxiety and depression score, fatigue impact score, and Short Form-36 results.
      Clinical responders who chose to continue a GFD after the study period were
      evaluated on average 18 months later to assess diet durability, symptom scores,
      and anthropometric and biochemical status. RESULTS: A 6-week GFD reduced IBS
      Symptom Severity Score by >/=50 points in 29 patients overall (71%). The mean
      total IBS Symptom Severity Score decreased from 286 before the diet to 131 points
      after 6 weeks on the diet (P < .001); the reduction was similar in each HLA-DQ
      group. However, HLA-DQ2/8-negative subjects had a greater reduction in abdominal 
      distention (P = .04). Both groups had marked mean improvements in hospital
      anxiety and depression scores, fatigue impact score, and Short Form-36 results,
      although HLA-DQ2/8-positive subjects had a greater reduction in depression score 
      and increase in vitality score than HLA-DQ2/8-negative subjects (P = .02 and P = 
      .03, respectively). Twenty-one of the 29 subjects with a clinical response (72%) 
      planned to continue the GFD long term; 18 months after the study they were still 
      on a GFD, with maintained symptom reductions, and demonstrated similar
      anthropometric and biochemical features compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: A
      dietitian-led GFD provided sustained benefit to patients with IBS-D. The symptoms
      that improved differed in magnitude according to HLA-DQ status. Clinical
      trials.gov no: NCT02528929.

      minerals, vitamins, trace elements and water. As it has been already suggested by
      Hippocrates, food can play a role in preventing but also in caring some diseases.
      The type of diet has medical, mediatic, economic and cultural implications. Many 
      diets are recommended but only a few of them have been validated. The fight
      against obesity has also created a lot of diet for losing weight. This article is
      a critical review of some diet in the domain of cancer, gluten sensitivity,
      irritable bowel syndrome and therapeutic fasting.

TI  - Comorbidities, Concomitant Medications, and Diet as Factors Affecting
      Levothyroxine Therapy: Results of the CONTROL Surveillance Project.
PG  - 53-68
LID - 10.1007/s40268-015-0116-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The CONTROL Surveillance Project was a comprehensive patient-based
      survey conducted among hypothyroid patients undergoing treatment. The primary
      objective of the study was to specifically quantify the prevalence of factors
      adversely affecting levothyroxine therapy. METHODS: Participants were selected
      from a large proprietary database. Those eligible for the study completed a
      21-question survey. RESULTS: Of the eligible hypothyroid patients, 925 (92.5%)
      were being treated with levothyroxine monotherapy. The mean age was 60.4 years;
      755 (81.6%) were female and 168 (18.2%) were male. Almost half of those receiving
      levothyroxine (435, 47.0%) had at least one comorbid condition that could
      adversely affect its absorption: gastroesophageal reflux disease (33.8% of
      patients), irritable bowel syndrome (9.7%), lactose intolerance (7.8%), or a
      history of gastric bypass surgery or bowel resection (3.0%). Other factors
      reported by many patients that could adversely affect levothyroxine absorption
      included use of prescription medications (20.6%) and over-the-counter medications
      (34.3%) used to treat comorbid gastrointestinal (GI) conditions; use of dietary
      supplements (51.8%, primarily calcium and iron); and intake of foods/beverages
      high in fiber, iodine, or soy (68.0%). Of the 13.4% who reported difficulty
      controlling their hypothyroid symptoms, significantly more patients with comorbid
      GI conditions reported such difficulty (7.8 versus 5.6%, P < 0.01). Frequent
      changes in levothyroxine dosing (two or more dose changes in the past year) were 
      reported by 8.0% of survey participants. Those with GI comorbidities were nearly 
      twice as likely to have such changes (5.0 versus 3.0%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:
      Better initial workup of patients, including identification of relevant GI
      comorbidities and allergies, may help in the early detection of factors that may 
      affect the performance of levothyroxine.

TI  - Dietary guidance normalizes large intestinal endocrine cell densities in patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 175-81
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the large intestinal endocrine cell types
      affected following dietary guidance in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study included 13 IBS patients and 13 control
      subjects. The patients received three sessions of individualized dietary
      guidance. Both the control subjects and the patients were scheduled for
      colonoscopies at baseline and again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary 
      guidance. Biopsy samples were taken from the colon and rectum and were
      immunostained for all types of large intestinal endocrine cells. The endocrine
      cells were quantified using computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The daily total
      consumption (mean+/-s.e.m. values) of fruits and vegetables rich in FODMAPs
      (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols)
      decreased significantly from 16.2+/-5.3 g before receiving dietary guidance to
      9.2+/-3.2 g after receiving dietary guidance (P=0.02). In the total colon, the
      densities of serotonin cells were 46.8+/-8.9, 10.5+/-2.1 and 22.6+/-3.2
      cells/mm(2) in control subjects and in IBS patients before and after receiving
      dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.007); the corresponding densities of peptide 
      YY cells were 11.6+/-1.8, 10.8+/-1.7 and 16.8+/-2.1 cells/mm(2), respectively
      (P=0.06). The cell densities for both serotonin and peptide YY did not change
      significantly in the rectum. The densities of somatostatin cells in the rectum
      were 13.5+/-3.0, 13.2+/-3.0, and 22.3+/-3.2 cells/mm(2) for control subjects and 
      for IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively
      (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The densities of the large intestinal endocrine cells tend
      to normalize following dietary guidance that may have contributed to the
      improvement of the patients with IBS symptoms.

TI  - Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis as Risk and Premorbid Factors of IBD and IBS Along the
      Childhood-Adulthood Transition.
PG  - 487-504
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000602 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal disorders, although clinically heterogeneous, share pathogenic
      mechanisms, including genetic susceptibility, impaired gut barrier function,
      altered microbiota, and environmental triggers (infections, social and behavioral
      factors, epigenetic control, and diet). Gut microbiota has been studied for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in either
      children or adults, while modifiable gut microbiota features, acting as risk and 
      premorbid factors along the childhood-adulthood transition, have not been
      thoroughly investigated so far. Indeed, the relationship between variations of
      the entire host/microbiota/environmental scenario and clinical phenotypes is
      still not fully understood. In this respect, tracking gut dysbiosis grading may
      help deciphering host phenotype-genotype associations and microbiota shifts in an
      integrated top-down omics-based approach within large-scale pediatric and adult
      case-control cohorts. Large-scale gut microbiota signatures and host inflammation
      patterns may be integrated with dietary habits, under genetic and epigenetic
      constraints, providing gut dysbiosis profiles acting as risk predictors of IBD or
      IBS in preclinical cases. Tracking dysbiosis supports new personalized/stratified
      IBD and IBS prevention programmes, generating Decision Support System tools. They
      include (1) high risk or flare-up recurrence -omics-based dysbiosis profiles; (2)
      microbial and molecular biomarkers of health and disease; (3) -omics-based
      pipelines for laboratory medicine diagnostics; (4) health apps for
      self-management of score-based dietary profiles, which can be shared with
      clinicians for nutritional habit and lifestyle amendment; (5) -omics profiling
      data warehousing and public repositories for IBD and IBS profile consultation.
      Dysbiosis-related indexes can represent novel laboratory and clinical medicine
      tools preventing or postponing the disease, finally interfering with its natural 
      history.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10-15% of the western population. Drug
      therapy for this entity has shown limited efficacy. The low Fermentable Oligo-,
      Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) diet has recently emerged as an
      effective intervention for reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS. Currently, 
      several mechanistic studies have proven the rational basis of carbohydrate
      restriction. In addition, high-quality evidence (prospective studies and
      randomized controlled trials) from a variety of countries supports the high
      effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet for IBS symptoms (70%), especially abdominal
      bloating, pain, and diarrhea. Importantly, this diet seems to be superior to a
      gluten-free diet for patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The most
      controversial features of the low FODMAP diet are its short- and long-term
      limitations (a high level of restriction, the need for monitoring by an expert
      dietitian, potential nutritional deficiencies, significant gut microbiota
      reduction, lack of predictors of response), as well as the potential lack of
      advantage over alternative dietary, pharmacological and psychological
      interventions for IBS. Although liberalization of carbohydrate intake is
      recommended in the long-term, the reintroduction process remains to be clarified 
      as, theoretically, global carbohydrate restriction is deemed to be necessary to
      avoid additive effects.

TI  - Alterations in serotonin metabolism in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 272-82
LID - 10.1111/apt.13459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonin (5-HT) metabolism have been postulated to
      play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However,
      previous reports regarding 5-HT metabolism in IBS are contradicting. AIM: To
      compare platelet poor plasma (PPP) 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) 
      levels and their ratio in a large cohort of IBS patients and healthy controls
      (HC), including IBS-subgroup analysis. METHODS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients
      and HC were evaluated for fasting PPP 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. Furthermore,
      GI-symptom diary, GSRS, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores were
      assessed in the 2 weeks before blood sampling. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty
      four IBS patients and 137 HC were included. No differences were detected in
      plasma 5-HT between groups. The 5-HIAA concentrations and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were 
      significantly lower in IBS compared to HC: 24.6 +/- 21.9 vs. 39.0 +/- 29.5 mug/L 
      (P < 0.001) and 8.4 +/- 12.2 vs. 13.5 +/- 16.6 (P < 0.01), respectively. Subtype 
      analysis for 5-HIAA showed all IBS subtypes to be significantly different from
      HC. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was significantly lower in the IBS-M subtype vs. HC.
      Linear regression analysis points to an influence of gender but not of
      GI-symptoms, psychological scores or medication use. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated
      that fasting 5-HT plasma levels are not significantly different in IBS patients
      compared to controls. However, decreased 5-HIAA levels and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in
      IBS patients may reflect altered serotonin metabolism in IBS. Gender affects
      5-HIAA levels in IBS patients, but no effects of drugs, such as SSRIs, or higher 
      GI-symptom or psychological scores were found.

TI  - Review article: insights into colonic protein fermentation, its modulation and
      potential health implications.
PG  - 181-96
LID - 10.1111/apt.13456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal
      health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful
      metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. 
      AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of
      colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for
      dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and
      pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation',
      'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate
      fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate
      diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and
      pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production 
      and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These
      metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal 
      inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and
      intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein
      intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and
      nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically,
      aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical
      importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein
      fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative
      colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake
      have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further
      clinical studies.

TI  - Quantitative Risk-Benefit Analysis of Probiotic Use for Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1007/s40264-015-0349-x [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have seen widespread use for a variety of gastrointestinal problems,
      especially in two common disorders: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory
      bowel disease. Since a wide variety of probiotic preparations has been used, and 
      despite a large number of studies performed, a great deal of heterogeneity exists
      among them. Straightforward evidence-based recommendations for the use of
      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease have thus
      been difficult to formulate. In an effort to improve understanding of the
      risk-benefit balance of probiotics in these conditions, this study (1) queried
      the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for all reported
      adverse drug events related to probiotics in 2013, and (2) constructed
      risk-benefit planes for both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease using a geometric approximation of the confidence region between risk and
      benefit. The results show that adverse events from probiotics vary widely by
      disease, and when they occur, they are mild and may be difficult to distinguish
      from the natural history of the underlying disorders they are used to treat. The 
      risk-benefit plane for irritable bowel syndrome straddles the risk-benefit
      threshold, so patients can expect a balance between a low chance of risk and also
      a low chance of benefit. The risk-benefit plane for inflammatory bowel disease
      largely lies above the risk-benefit threshold, so patients may expect more
      benefit than risk in most cases. More standardized and high-quality research is
      needed to improve our understanding of risk and benefit for these complex
      biopharmaceuticals.

TI  - Relationship Between Microbiota of the Colonic Mucosa vs Feces and Symptoms,
      Colonic Transit, and Methane Production in Female Patients With Chronic
      Constipation.
PG  - 367-79.e1
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.10.005 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(15)01436-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In fecal samples from patients with chronic constipation, the 
      microbiota differs from that of healthy subjects. However, the profiles of fecal 
      microbiota only partially replicate those of the mucosal microbiota. It is not
      clear whether these differences are caused by variations in diet or colonic
      transit, or are associated with methane production (measured by breath tests). We
      compared the colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota in patients with chronic
      constipation and in healthy subjects to investigate the relationships between
      microbiota and other parameters. METHODS: Sigmoid colonic mucosal and fecal
      microbiota samples were collected from 25 healthy women (controls) and 25 women
      with chronic constipation and evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing
      (average, 49,186 reads/sample). We assessed associations between microbiota
      (overall composition and operational taxonomic units) and demographic variables, 
      diet, constipation status, colonic transit, and methane production (measured in
      breath samples after oral lactulose intake). RESULTS: Fourteen patients with
      chronic constipation had slow colonic transit. The profile of the colonic mucosal
      microbiota differed between constipated patients and controls (P < .05). The
      overall composition of the colonic mucosal microbiota was associated with
      constipation, independent of colonic transit (P < .05), and discriminated between
      patients with constipation and controls with 94% accuracy. Genera from
      Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the colonic mucosal microbiota of patients
      with constipation. The profile of the fecal microbiota was associated with
      colonic transit before adjusting for constipation, age, body mass index, and
      diet; genera from Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Lactococcus, and Roseburia)
      correlated with faster colonic transit. Methane production was associated with
      the composition of the fecal microbiota, but not with constipation or colonic
      transit. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for diet and colonic transit, the profile
      of the microbiota in the colonic mucosa could discriminate patients with
      constipation from healthy individuals. The profile of the fecal microbiota was
      associated with colonic transit and methane production (measured in breath), but 
      not constipation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed a comprehensive self-management (CSM) program
      that combines cognitive behavioral therapy with relaxation and dietary
      strategies; 9 sessions (1 hour each) over 13 weeks were shown to reduce
      gastrointestinal symptoms and increase quality of life in a randomized trial of
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), compared with usual care. The aims 
      of this study were to describe strategies patients with IBS selected and
      continued to use, 12 months after the CSM program began. METHODS: We performed a 
      cohort study to continue to follow 81 adults with IBS (87% female; mean age, 45
      +/- 15 years old) who received the CSM program in the previous clinical trial.
      During the last CSM session, participants selected strategies they intended to
      continue using to manage their IBS. CSM strategies were categorized into
      subthemes of diet (composition, trigger foods, meal size or timing, and eating
      behaviors), relaxation (specific relaxation strategies and lifestyle behaviors), 
      and alternative thoughts (identifying thought distortions, challenging underlying
      beliefs, and other strategies). Twelve months later, participants were asked how 
      often they used each strategy (not at all or rarely, occasionally, often, very
      often, or almost always). RESULTS: At the last CSM session, 95% of the patients
      selected the subthemes of specific relaxation strategies, 90% selected diet
      composition, and 90% identified thought distortions for continued use. At 12
      months, 94% of the participants (76 of 81) were still using at least 6
      strategies, and adherence was greater than 79% for all subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: We
      developed a CSM program to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life in
      patients with IBS that produced sustainable behavioral changes in almost all
      patients (94%) after 1 year of follow-up.

TI  - Frequency and Cause of Persistent Symptoms in Celiac Disease Patients on a
      Long-term Gluten-free Diet.
PG  - 239-43
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000392 [doi]
AB  - GOALS: To estimate the frequency and cause of nonresponsive celiac disease (CD). 
      BACKGROUND: Treatment of CD is based on life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet
      (GFD). Some celiac patients experience persistence of symptoms despite a GFD.
      This condition is defined as nonresponsive CD. STUDY: Celiac patients on a GFD
      for at least 12 months underwent diet compliance assessment, laboratory tests,
      breath tests, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations according to the
      symptoms/signs reported. RESULTS: Seventy of 321 (21.8%) patients had persistent 
      or recurrent symptoms/signs. The cause of symptom persistence was evaluated in 56
      of 70 patients. Thirteen of 56 (23%) patients were antiendomysial antibody
      positive. Among the patients with negative serology, 1 had fibromyalgia, and 3
      had evidence that disproved the diagnosis of CD. The remaining 39 patients with
      negative serology underwent duodenal biopsy sampling, which evidenced histologic 
      alterations in 24 patients. Among the 15 patients with normal histology 3 were
      lactose intolerant, 9 had irritable bowel syndrome, 2 had gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, and in 1 patient a cause for the persistent symptom was not identified. 
      In patients with confirmed diagnosis of CD, exposure to dietary gluten was the
      main cause of persistence of symptoms/signs, and consistently after dietary
      modification, symptoms resolved in 63% of the patients at later time points
      during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Nonresponsive CD occurs in nearly one fifth of
      celiac patients on GFD and its occurrence suggests further investigations to
      optimize the management of celiac patients.

TI  - The role of vitamin D in reducing gastrointestinal disease risk and assessment of
      individual dietary intake needs: Focus on genetic and genomic technologies.
PG  - 119-33
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201500243 [doi]
AB  - With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because 
      of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary
      sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing
      susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal
      cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel
      syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such
      diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake
      overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have
      revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature 
      of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating
      vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data,
      including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a
      position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
      proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency
      has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for
      considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary
      supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might
      beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for
      optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.

TI  - Does oral alpha-galactosidase relieve irritable bowel symptoms?
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1063156 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal bloating is reported by a majority of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients. Excess colonic fermentation may cause gaseous symptoms. 
      Several foodstuffs contain oligosaccharides with an alpha-galactosidic linkage
      that is resistant to mammalian hydrolases. Assisted hydrolysis by exogenous
      alpha-galactosidase enzyme (AG) could offer a way of controlling IBS symptoms by 
      reducing colonic fermentation and gas production. The aim of this study was to
      assess the effect of AG on symptom severity and quality of life in IBS patients
      with abdominal bloating or flatulence. METHODS: A total of 125 subjects with IBS 
      received AG or placebo at meals for 12 weeks. IBS-Symptom Severity Score
      (IBS-SSS) and quality of life (QoL) were assessed at baseline, during the
      treatment and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: AG showed a trend toward a more
      prominent decrease in IBS-SSS. The responder rate at week 16 was higher for the
      AG group. No difference was detected in QoL between AG and placebo groups. A
      total of 25 patients (18 in AG group and 7 in placebo group, p = 0.016) withdrew 
      from the study. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were more often reported as reason
      for withdrawal in AG group. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support the use 
      of AG routinely in IBS patients. Improvement of clinical response at 4-week
      follow-up may suggest a long-term effect of unknown mechanism, but could also be 
      attributed to non-responder drop out. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects may be a
      coincidence in this study, but irritation of GI tract by AG administration cannot
      be excluded.

TI  - Sensitivity to wheat, gluten and FODMAPs in IBS: facts or fiction?
PG  - 169-78
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309757 [doi]
AB  - IBS is one of the most common types of functional bowel disorder. Increasing
      attention has been paid to the causative role of food in IBS. Food ingestion
      precipitates or exacerbates symptoms, such as abdominal pain and bloating in
      patients with IBS through different hypothesised mechanisms including immune and 
      mast cell activation, mechanoreceptor stimulation and chemosensory activation.
      Wheat is regarded as one of the most relevant IBS triggers, although which
      component(s) of this cereal is/are involved remain(s) unknown. Gluten, other
      wheat proteins, for example, amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fructans (the latter
      belonging to fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)), have
      been identified as possible factors for symptom generation/exacerbation. This
      uncertainty on the true culprit(s) opened a scenario of semantic definitions
      favoured by the discordant results of double-blind placebo-controlled trials,
      which have generated various terms ranging from non-coeliac gluten sensitivity to
      the broader one of non-coeliac wheat or wheat protein sensitivity or, even,
      FODMAP sensitivity. The role of FODMAPs in eliciting the clinical picture of IBS 
      goes further since these short-chain carbohydrates are found in many other
      dietary components, including vegetables and fruits. In this review, we assessed 
      current literature in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity
      represent 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms. This knowledge is expected
      to promote standardisation in dietary strategies (gluten/wheat-free and low
      FODMAP) as effective measures for the management of IBS symptoms.

TI  - Does a diet low in FODMAPs reduce symptoms associated with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 897-906
LID - 10.1007/s00394-015-0922-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain,
      bloating, distension, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence have been noted in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      The diversity of symptoms has meant that finding an effective treatment has been 
      challenging with most treatments alleviating only the primary symptom. A novel
      treatment option for IBS and IBD currently generating much excitement is the low 
      fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet. The aim of
      this meta-analysis was to determine the evidence of the efficacy of such a diet
      in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Electronic
      databases were searched through to March 2015 to identify relevant studies.
      Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the
      effect of a low FODMAP diet on the reduction in IBS [Symptoms Severity Score
      (SSS)] score and increase in IBS quality of life (QOL) score for both randomized 
      clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized interventions using a random-effects
      model. RESULTS: Six RCTs and 16 non-randomized interventions were included in the
      analysis. There was a significant decrease in IBS SSS scores for those
      individuals on a low FODMAP diet in both the RCTs (OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.25-0.76; I 
      (2) = 35.52, p = 0.00) and non-randomized interventions (OR 0.03, 95 % CI
      0.01-0.2; I (2) = 69.1, p = 0.02). In addition, there was a significant
      improvement in the IBS-QOL score for RCTs (OR 1.84, 95 % CI 1.12-3.03; I (2) =
      0.00, p = 0.39) and for non-randomized interventions (OR 3.18, 95 % CI 1.60-6.31;
      I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.89). Further, following a low FODMAP diet was found to
      significantly reduce symptom severity for abdominal pain (OR 1.81, 95 % CI
      1.13-2.88; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.56), bloating (OR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.07-2.87; I (2) =
      0.00, p = 0.45) and overall symptoms (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.11-2.95; I (2) = 0.00, p
      = 0.4) in the RCTs. In the non-randomized interventions similar findings were
      observed. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis supports the efficacy of a low
      FODMAP diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Further
      research should ensure studies include dietary adherence, and more studies
      looking at greater number of patients and long-term adherence to a low FODMAP
      diet need to be conducted.
