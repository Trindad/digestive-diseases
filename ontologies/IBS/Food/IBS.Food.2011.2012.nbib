TI  - [Lactase deficiency in patients with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and 
      the role of intestinal microflora in its development].
PG  - 91-8
AB  - PURPOSE: to define the frequency of secondary lactase deficiency (SLD) in
      patients with postinfectious IBS and to develop therapy for the correction of
      mild SLD in adult patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this study, 138 patients
      (the mean age - 33.9 +/- 9.09; F/M - 112/26) with postinfectious IBS were
      analyzed concerning lactase deficiency. All patients underwent intestinal
      endoscopy with biopsies from the mucosa of the descending duodenum in order to
      determine lactase deficiency twice before and after therapy. To diagnose small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) all patients underwent lactulose breath
      test during 2 hours. RESULTS: SLD was detected in 59.4% of patients with
      postinfectious IBS. Mild SLD was determined in 43.5% of patients, and severe SLD 
      - in 15.9% of patients. SLD in all cases was accompanied by SIBO (the mean level 
      of lactulose breath test was 101 +/- 37 ppm, N<20 ppm). In group patients who
      took the probiotic during 14 days in 70.8% of patients recovering of lactose
      metabolism in the small intestine and decreasing of the intensity of clinical
      symptoms were registered. The decrease of the lactulose breath test level (86.9
      +/- 40.9 ppm; 17.4 +/- 6.6 ppm; p<0.01) and negative LQT (p<0.01) were registered
      in the first group. In group patients who took placebo during 14 days there was
      no positive effect in 68.4% of cases. CONCLUSION: the probiotic Bifiform,
      composed of Bifidobacterium longum 10(7) and Enterococcus faecium 10(7),
      demonstrated efficiency in correction of mild SLD in patients with postinfectious
      IBS and can be used to prevent SIBO.

AB  - There is an undeniable link between gastrointestinal disorders and malnutrition. 
      Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions that can 
      impact a patient's nutritional status. The nutritional consequences will depend
      on the cause of the diarrhoea as well as the location and extent of
      gastrointestinal involvement. In general, malabsorption plays a central role in
      the interaction between malnutrition and chronic diarrhoea. Malabsorption can
      result in both nutritional deficits and diarrhoea. With severe malnutrition,
      chronic diarrhoea can persist due to impaired immune function and poor mucosal
      recovery. Food intolerance and an inappropriate diet in the setting of
      malabsorption may also contribute to chronic diarrhoea. Patients may attribute
      their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific dietary intake, which can lead to
      self-imposed indiscriminate dietary restrictions. Therefore, disease-specific
      treatment in conjunction with appropriate nutritional counselling and
      intervention is recommended in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in
      patients with chronic diarrhoea. Specialized nutritional support through enteral 
      or parenteral administration may be required to treat severe caloric and
      micronutrient deficiencies. In this review, we aim to summarize the mechanism,
      diagnosis, and treatment of the nutritional consequences of chronic diarrhoea.

AB  - IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which has been subtyped according
      to bowel habits. This review presents recommendations for IBS-D which makes up
      about 1/3 of all patients and which is defined as IBS with loose or watery stools
      with >/=25% of bowel movements. Because IBS is a complex biopsychosocial illness,
      treatment cannot and should not be directed only to altered bowel habits.
      Evidence will be presented for dietary manipulations, probiotics and
      pharmacotherapies including tricyclic agents, antibiotics, serotonin antagonists 
      and anti-diarrhoeal agents in the management of patients with IBS-D.

TI  - [Effect of acupuncture at "Zusanli" (ST 36 and "Taichong" (LR 3) on
      gastrointestinal hormone levels in rats with diarrhea type irritable bowel
      syndrome].
PG  - 363-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture of "Zusanli" (ST 36) and
      "Taichong" (LR 3) on gastrointestinal hormone levels in diarrhea type irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rats so as to provide experimental evidence for
      acupuncture treatment of IBS-D. METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were randomly
      divided into control, model, acupuncture and medication groups, with 12 rats in
      each group. IBS-D model was established by chronic mild restraining stress
      combined with isolated raising and intragastric administration of Folium Sennae
      (10 mL/kg). For rats of the acupuncture group, bilateral "Zusanli" (ST 36) and
      "Taichong" (LR 3) were punctured and stimulated for 30 min, once daily for 14
      days. The rats of the medication group were treated by gavage of Pinaverin
      bromide, once daily for 14 days, and those of the control and model groups were
      given with equal volume of saline. Somatostatin (SS), substance P (SP) and
      vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the rats' plasma and ileum tissues were
      detected by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Compared
      with the control group, the body weight and food intake quantity were reduced
      significantly, while the diarrhea index was increased significantly in the model 
      group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In comparison with the model group, the body weight
      and food intake volume in both acupuncture and medication groups were increased
      remarkably after the treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) whereas the diarrhea index in
      the latter two groups was reduced obviously (P < 0.01). Compared with the control
      group, plasma VIP level was increased significantly in the model group (P <
      0.01), while those in both acupuncture and medication groups were decreased
      remarkably compared with the model group (P < 0.05). No significant changes of
      plasma SP and SS levels were found after modeling and after both acupuncture and 
      medication treatments. In comparison with the control group, ileum SP, VIP and SS
      levels in the model group were up-regulated significantly (P < 0.01), while those
      in both acupuncture and medication groups were down-regulated considerably
      compared with the model group (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found
      between acupuncture and medication groups in the levels of ileum SP, VIP and SS
      (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture of ST 36 and LR 3 can effectively
      down-regulate ileum SP, VIP and SS levels in IBS-D rats, which may contribute to 
      its effect in relieving IBS-D.

TI  - Does our food (environment) change our gut microbiome ('in-vironment'): a
      potential role for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - [Probiotic supplement (Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus) utility in the
      treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 387-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common functional condition 
      and a frequent cause of consultation in gastroenterology. With a multifactorial
      pathophysiology IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, distension and altered
      bowel habits. Loperamide, antispasmodics and antidepressants are symptomatic
      relievers of this disorder. Recently probiotics were incorporated to therapy, and
      could improve the symptomatology. METHODS: multicenter randomized
      placebo-controlled trial that included IBS patients, diagnosed with Rome III
      criteria. The patients were given pinaverium bromure and placebo or pinaverium
      bromure and probiotics for 3 weeks. The intensity of symptoms and the effect of
      therapy were evaluated with the Francis Score, before and after the treatment.
      Statistics were done with SPSS 12.0 (C.I 95%). RESULTS: 51 patients were
      evaluated, with an average age of 43 years old, mostly mestizo, 75% (38) married 
      and 55% (28) female. There were statistical differences in four variables:
      abdominal pain, intensity of pain, days of pain and total score at the end of
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics used as supplement are effective in improving
      symptomatology of IBS.

PG  - 357-62
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent papers highlight the role of the diet in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), but very few population-based studies have evaluated this. 
      The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of IBS in the general urban 
      population and to evaluate the type of diet associated with IBS symptoms.
      METHODS: A randomized sample of subjects (n=300) from a general urban population 
      in Romania selected from family doctors' patient lists was invited for interview 
      in the doctor's office. Selected subjects were evaluated for the diagnosis of IBS
      using Rome III criteria and for their eating habits and diet using a food
      frequency questionnaire. Socio-demographic factors and general medical history
      were also included in the interview together with standard weight measurements.
      Results from logistic regression were presented as odd ratios and 95 % confidence
      intervals. RESULTS: From the selected sample, 193 subjects (80 males, 113 women, 
      mean age 50.8 +/- 16.2) agreed to participate (rate 64.3%). Prevalence of IBS was
      19.1 % (19.4% for females and 18.7 % for males). IBS was associated with older
      age (1.05, 1.02-1.08, p <0.001) and past history of digestive diseases (5.0,
      2.0-12.7, p<0.01). IBS subjects eat significantly more frequently canned food
      (23.74, 3.17-177.7, p<0.01), processed meat (4.7, 1.6-14.1, p<0.01), pulses
      (legumes) (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.01), whole cereals (8.7, 2.0-37.8, p<0.01),

      2.5-23.1, p<0.001) and herb teas (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study updates prevalence data and reveals a possible association between diet and
      irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Effects on gastrointestinal functions and symptoms of serotonergic psychoactive
      agents used in functional gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 177-81
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0726-5 [doi]
AB  - The effects of antidepressants on the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to
      their potential efficacy in functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome;
      buspirone, a prototype 5-HT1A agonist, enhances gastric accommodation and reduces
      postprandial symptoms in response to a challenge meal. Paroxetine, a selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor, accelerates small bowel but not colonic transit,
      and this property may not be relevant to improve gut function in functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. Venlafaxine, a prototype serotonin norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitor, enhances gastric accommodation, increases colonic compliance 
      and reduces sensations to distension; however, it is associated with adverse
      effects that reduce its applicability in treatment of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants reduce sensations in response to food,
      including nausea, and delay gastric emptying, especially in females. Buspirone
      appears efficacious in functional dyspepsia; amitriptyline was not efficacious in
      a large trial of children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Clinical
      trials of antidepressants for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are generally
      small. The recommendations of efficacy and number needed to treat from
      meta-analyses are suspect, and more prospective trials are needed in patients
      without diagnosed psychiatric diseases. Antidepressants appear to be more
      effective in the treatment of patients with anxiety or depression, but larger
      prospective trials assessing both clinical and pharmacodynamic effects on gut
      sensorimotor function are needed.

PG  - 1287-91
LID - 10.1111/imj.12015 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics in
      various areas of gastrointestinal (GI) health. Probiotics are defined as live
      microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when
      administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress 
      bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier
      function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials
      are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with
      better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon
      yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the
      current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health.

      intake in healthy subjects and patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2012.11.034 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of lactase deficiency on digestive symptoms and
      diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not been well defined. 
      We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in 
      healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS).
      METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital,
      Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect
      malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in
      random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the
      dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose
      intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of
      controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS 
      were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 
      1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; 
      P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients
      with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 
      95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However,
      self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests.
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and
      intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported 
      LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with
      avoidance of dairy products.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating functional disorder 
      of the gastrointestinal tract with serious and detrimental impacts on quality of 
      life. Its aetiology is largely unknown and the identification of effective
      management strategies remains far from complete. This paper first reports, a case
      of a 41-year-old woman IBS sufferer who reported significant symptom improvements
      with high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation. The sufferer identified a substantial 
      body of patient data surrounding this potential therapy on social media sites,
      and this paper, therefore, also reports the findings from a systematic analysis
      of patient-centred, internet-based data surrounding this phenomenon. Data from 37
      IBS sufferers commenting on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on their
      condition were located; approximately 70% of these reported that high-dose
      supplementation improved their IBS symptoms. A randomised controlled trial into
      the effect of vitamin D supplementation on IBS symptomatology to test this
      association scientifically is merited.

PG  - 514-25
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2012.02296.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapeutic potential of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based
      elimination diet among migraine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      BACKGROUND: Food elimination has been suggested as an effective and inexpensive
      therapeutic strategy in patients with migraine and concomitant IBS in the past
      studies. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 38.0
      [11.2] years; 85.7% females) diagnosed with migraine and IBS were included in
      this double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial composed of 
      baseline (usual diet), first diet (elimination or provocation diets), and second 
      diet (interchange of elimination or provocations diets) phases and 4 visits.
      RESULTS: IgG antibody tests against 270 food allergens revealed mean (standard
      deviation) reaction count to be 23.1 (14.1). Compared with baseline levels,
      elimination diet per se was associated with significant reductions in attack
      count (4.8 [2.1] vs 2.7 [2.0]; P < .001), maximum attack duration (2.6 [0.6] vs. 
      1.4 [1.1] days; P < .001), mean attack duration (1.8 [0.5] vs. 1.1 [0.8] days; P 
      < .01), maximum attack severity (visual analog scale 8.5 [1.4] vs. visual analog 
      scale 6.6 [3.3]; P < .001), and number of attacks with acute medication (4.0
      [1.5] vs. 1.9 [1.8]; P < .001). There was a significant reduction in
      pain-bloating severity (1.8 [1.3] vs. 3.2 [0.8]; P < .05), pain-bloating within
      the last 10 days (3.2 [2.8] vs. 5.5 [3.1]; P < .05), and improvement obtained in 
      quality of life (3.6 [1.4] vs. 2.9 [1.0]; P < .05) by the elimination diet as
      compared with provocation diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that food
      elimination based on IgG antibodies in migraine patients who suffer from
      concomitant IBS may effectively reduce symptoms from both disorders with possible
      positive impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as potential
      savings to the health-care system.

TI  - Non-celiac wheat sensitivity: separating the wheat from the chat!
PG  - 1908-12
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.344 [doi]
AB  - Historically, it has been reported that patients with undetected celiac disease
      (CD) may present with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) type symptoms. This has led 
      to the recommendation by the American College of Gastroenterology Task force that
      patients presenting with diarrhea predominant IBS type symptoms should be
      serologically tested for CD. Concurrently speculative media data suggest that the
      US general public have increased their uptake of a gluten-free diet (GFD) far in 
      excess of the known prevalence of CD. This may suggest that individuals with
      gastrointestinal symptoms are deriving benefit from a GFD even if they do not
      have CD. This has led to the scientific community considering the evidence for an
      emerging concept of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. There is a significant
      disparity in our views about what this phenomenon may be. There is also confusion
      about the nomenclature for this entity and indeed whether patients are suffering 
      due to symptoms related to gluten or perhaps other components of wheat, for
      example fructans. In this month's edition of the American Journal of
      Gastroenterology, we see evidence to support the clinical concept of wheat
      sensitivity or intolerance. Irrespective of the nomenclature Carroccio provides a
      clinically applicable approach that may be adopted internationally by clinicians.
      This offers a new option in our armamentarium when seeing patients with IBS type 
      symptoms.

AB  - The brain-gut axis allows bidirectional communication between the central nervous
      system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), linking emotional and
      cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. Recent
      experimental work suggests that the gut microbiota have an impact on the
      brain-gut axis. A group of experts convened by the International Scientific
      Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) discussed the role of gut
      bacteria on brain functions and the implications for probiotic and prebiotic
      science. The experts reviewed and discussed current available data on the role of
      gut microbiota on epithelial cell function, gastrointestinal motility, visceral
      sensitivity, perception and behavior. Data, mostly gathered from animal studies, 
      suggest interactions of gut microbiota not only with the enteric nervous system
      but also with the central nervous system via neural, neuroendocrine, neuroimmune 
      and humoral links. Microbial colonization impacts mammalian brain development in 
      early life and subsequent adult behavior. These findings provide novel insights
      for improved understanding of the potential role of gut microbial communities on 
      psychological disorders, most particularly in the field of psychological
      comorbidities associated with functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and should present new opportunity for interventions with pro- and
      prebiotics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims were: firstly, to review the definition and diagnosis of
      irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C, a subtype of IBS); secondly,
      to critically assess current therapies for IBS-C with a focus on effectiveness
      for abdominal pain; and thirdly, to review clinical studies evaluating the
      efficacy of linaclotide, a therapy recently approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of adults with IBS-C and chronic idiopathic
      constipation and the European Medicines Agency for the symptomatic treatment of
      moderate to severe IBS-C in adults, and in development for treatment of IBS-C
      worldwide. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed to summarize 
      IBS-C and current treatments. MEDLINE and gastrointestinal society congress
      proceedings were searched to identify data from linaclotide clinical studies in
      adults with IBS-C published between January 2010 and August 2012. RESULTS: IBS-C 
      patients have chronic, relapsing symptoms. Rome III diagnostic criteria define
      the presence of chronic abdominal pain that improves with defecation and has
      onset associated with changes in stool frequency or form as a key element of
      IBS-C and other IBS subtypes. IBS-C patients generally are not completely
      satisfied with existing therapies. A therapy that treats bowel and abdominal
      symptoms effectively and can be taken safely on a chronic basis is a current
      unmet need for IBS-C patients. The guanylate cyclase-C agonist linaclotide has
      been shown to reduce visceral hypersensitivity in preclinical studies and to
      improve abdominal pain and constipation symptoms in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials
      of IBS-C patients. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-C is a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      with chronic, relapsing abdominal and constipation symptoms. By virtue of its
      effects in relieving abdominal pain by reducing visceral hypersensitivity and
      improving constipation symptoms by increasing intestinal secretion and
      accelerating transit, linaclotide may be uniquely positioned for a role in the
      management of IBS-C patients.

TI  - IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome: a case control
      study in the general population.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often relate their
      symptoms to the intake of food and modify their diet. IgE-mediated food allergy
      is uncommon in IBS, but the role of IgG-mediated food hypersensitivity remains
      inconclusive. The primary aim of this study was to compare food- and
      yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with and without IBS. METHODS:
      This was a case control study in the general population for which subjects
      completed questionnaires about abdominal complaints and their intake of common
      food items. Blood samples were collected, and food- and yeast-specific IgG and
      IgG4 antibodies were measured. Antibodies were measured in mg/L. RESULTS: We
      included 269 subjects with IBS and 277 control subjects. After correction for
      subject characteristics and diet, there were no significant differences with
      regard to food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies between subjects with 
      IBS and controls. Lower values of IgG antibodies against egg (OR 0.99 (0.98 to
      1.00), p = 0.002) and beef (OR 0.75 (0.60 to 0.94), p = 0.012) and higher values 
      of IgG antibodies against chicken (OR 1.14 (1.03 to 1.27), p = 0.009) were
      associated with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that
      IgG-and IgG4-mediated food and yeast hypersensitivity in IBS is unlikely. IgG
      antibodies against food and yeast may reflect the diet.

TI  - Linaclotide: promising IBS-C efficacy in an era of provisional study endpoints.
PG  - 1726-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.325 [doi]
AB  - Recent disappointing developments in the pharmacotherapy of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) have not dampened the enthusiasm surrounding linaclotide, a novel 
      guanylate cyclase-C agonist for the management of constipation-predominant IBS
      (IBS-C). Two recent phase 3 studies reporting on a single, daily dose of
      linaclotide are presented in this issue of the American Journal of
      Gastroenterology. Importantly, these studies are the first to examine a
      provisional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) combined response endpoint for
      IBS-C, which mandates improvements of both abdominal pain and defecatory
      symptoms. Potential limitations of this FDA endpoint relate to a lack of
      inclusion of other potentially important IBS symptoms and an inability to
      directly compare findings with other recent IBS-C trials. Both studies
      successfully reached this endpoint in approximately one-third of study subjects, 
      resulting in numbers needed to treat (NNT) of five to eight, to achieve an FDA
      responder. Individual symptom responses to linaclotide were seen in nearly 50% of
      participants, and potential explanations for these discrepancies when compared
      with the FDA endpoint are offered. Adequate relief measures also were assessed
      and, with NNTs of 3.4-6.8, compared favorably with other contemporary IBS-C
      studies. Overall, both linaclotide trials found the medication to be safe in
      terms of serious adverse events, though the secretagogue mechanism of action led 
      to diarrhea in approximately one in five subjects. Together, these studies
      inspire several other important questions regarding linaclotide, including its
      role in the management of IBS-C relative to existing treatment options, such as
      lubiprostone. Greater clinical use of linaclotide will reveal whether the
      observed responses measured with the FDA provisional endpoint will translate into
      real-world experiences of improvement in IBS patients.

AB  - Guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) is a transmembrane receptor activated by bacterial
      heat-stable enterotoxins and by the endogenous hormones guanylin and uroguanylin.
      GC-C plays key roles in the regulation of intestinal fluid and electrolyte
      homeostasis. This is highlighted by several recently identified human mutations
      in GUCY2C, the gene encoding GC-C, which leads to the respective gain or loss of 
      function of GC-C, resulting in profound effects on gastrointestinal function.
      However, a wealth of recent studies indicates GC-C signalling extends to a
      multitude of diverse additional functions. Recent pre-clinical and clinical
      studies demonstrate a novel first-in-class GC-C activating peptide, Linaclotide, 
      provides effective relief from constipation and abdominal pain in patients with
      chronic constipation and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
      Accumulating evidence also suggests GC-C plays protective roles in mucosal
      barrier function, tissue injury and inflammation, whilst GC-C signalling is a key
      regulator of intestinal cell proliferation and apoptosis. Finally, recently
      identified extra-intestinal GC-C signalling pathways make novel contributions to 
      the regulation of food intake and symptoms associated with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder. Consequently, these findings provide GC-C expression and 
      its associated mutations as potential diagnostic markers for disease. They also
      provide current and future therapeutic potential for GC-C signalling within and
      outside the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The traditional classification of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a
      functional disorder has been challenged in recent years by evidence of ongoing
      low-grade gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Inflammation may alter
      gastrointestinal motility and thus be central to the pathogenesis of IBS. Many
      foods and food additives are known to cause allergic contact dermatitis. We
      hypothesize that allergenic foods and food additives may elicit a similar
      allergic reaction in the gastrointestinal tract, giving rise to symptoms
      suggestive of IBS. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether skin patch testing
      to a panel of foods and food additives may identify food allergens that may be
      responsible for symptoms of IBS. METHODS: We performed skin patch testing to
      common allergenic foods and food additives on individuals with a history of or
      symptoms suggestive of IBS. We used patch test-guided avoidance diets to
      determine whether avoidance alleviates IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty of the 51
      study participants showed at least 1 doubtful or positive patch test result.
      Fourteen of the participants reported symptomatic improvement, ranging from
      slight to great, upon avoidance of the foods/food additives to which they
      reacted. LIMITATIONS: Double-blind study design, inclusion of only patients with 
      active IBS, larger sample size, more balanced gender distribution, testing of
      more foods/food additives, and longer duration of and more precise quantification
      of response to dietary avoidance are suggested for future studies. CONCLUSION:
      Allergic contact enteritis to ingested foods, food additives, or both may
      contribute to IBS symptoms. Patch testing may be useful in identifying the
      causative foods.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic constipation (CC) are common problems 
      worldwide and are associated with significant impact on activities of daily
      living and quality of life. Recent interest, in IBS in particular, has focused on
      the potential roles of the microbiota and its interaction with the host's immune 
      system. Recently, high-quality clinical trials have been performed on prebiotics 
      and probiotics in IBS or CC. Although strategies that seek to modify the
      microbiota, such as the use of probiotics, offer much promise in IBS and CC, more
      high-quality trials and, studies of longer duration are required.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: diet and complementary medicine therapies?].
PG  - 430-5
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent and invalidating functional bowel
      disorder with entangled mechanisms. Its therapeutic approach is therefore
      complex. Classical therapies, prescribed alone or in combination in light of the 
      predominant symptom, consist of antispasmodics, fibers, laxatives,
      antidiarrheals, and psychotropic agents. Other emerging pharmacological
      therapies, such as prokinetics, prosecretory or serotoninergic agents, bile acid 
      modulators and antibiotics have been recently studied in clinical trials. Dietary
      measures can include reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (FODMAPs) and gluten restriction. Assessment of food allergy can be proposed in a
      subgroup of IBS patients. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies, that 
      are generally low cost and safe, appear to be appreciated by patients. Probiotics
      have demonstrated action on the gut microbiote modulation, and may be helpful in 
      a subset of patients. Peppermint oil has an established visceral analgesic
      effect. Hypnotherapy represents an original, global and effective approach.
      Finally, education, reassurance and listening to the patient, leading to a solid 
      therapeutic relationship, represents an essential backdrop of remedy or diet
      effectiveness.

AB  - In the past few years, intestinal microbiota has emerged as a novel target for
      the treatment of gut-brain axis alterations. These include functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can be 
      comorbid with stress-related psychiatric conditions. Thus, modulation of the
      microbiota (e.g. with the use of probiotics) could be proposed as a novel
      strategy not only for the treatment of IBS but also as an adjuvant for
      psychiatric treatment of anxiety and depression.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The human gastrointestinal lumen is inhabited by a wide
      variety of microbiota. Our understanding of the intestinal microbiota and its
      full consequences on gastrointestinal health is still evolving. However, it is
      well accepted that altered colonic flora drives the pathogenesis of many
      disorders and diseases as seen in antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium 
      difficile infection. Recent works published in the area of probiotics are
      reviewed here. RECENT FINDINGS: Alterations in colonic microbiota, or dysbiosis, 
      are now implicated in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Probiotics and prebiotics are evolving treatment options that are targeted at
      restoring nonpathogenic digestive flora. There has been great interest in the
      role of these therapies in treatment of many diseases including childhood
      diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. SUMMARY: Trials of
      probiotics have been shown to be helpful in some of these, not in others, and
      more work is needed in others. We review recent work done in these areas.

PG  - 473-97

AB  - Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders constitute the majority of
      patients seeking healthcare for gastrointestinal symptoms in primary and
      secondary care. Of these disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the
      most common and affects 10-20% in the Western world. IBS is a functional bowel
      disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and
      alteration of bowel habits in the absence of any detectable organic cause. Sex
      and gender aspects are important in understanding differences between men and
      women in their risk and experience of IBS. Relative to men, women are diagnosed
      more frequently with IBS. Female patients are more likely to be constipated,
      complain of abdominal distension and of certain extracolonic symptoms. Given the 
      variability of IBS, the most successful treatment will be comprehensive,
      involving multiple strategies. Efficacy, safety and tolerability are important in
      the evaluation of IBS therapies, as patients are likely to require long-term
      treatment. Laxatives, antidiarrheals or antispasmodics are common in the
      treatment of IBS but the majority of patients receive antispasmodics followed by 
      prokinetic agents. In treatment of IBS there appears to be a greater clinical
      response to serotonergic agents developed for IBS in women compared to men. There
      is an absence of drugs licensed specifically for the treatment of IBS. Further
      studies with novel agents are needed, to evaluate new approaches to IBS
      management including gender specific behavioral therapies and better
      characterization of patient subgroups with regard to drug therapy so that
      personalized therapy can be tested.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare chronic physical health disorder prevalence amongst
      Australian adults with and without mental illness. METHOD: Total n=1,716
      participants (58% female) with a mean age of 52 +/- 13 years (range: 18 to 89
      years) completed an online survey of Australian adults in 2010. Outcome measures 
      including prevalence of chronic physical conditions and self-reported body mass
      index (BMI) in n=387 (23%) with a self-reported mental illness diagnosis were
      compared to respondents without mental illness. RESULTS: A significantly higher
      proportion of participants with mental illness were obese (BMI >/= 30; 31 vs 24%,
      p=0.005). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic
      bronchitis or emphysema, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies or 
      intolerances (OR range: 1.54-3.19) demonstrated that chronic physical disorders
      were significantly more common in participants with a mental illness. CONCLUSION:
      Australian adults with a diagnosis for mental illness have a significantly
      increased likelihood of demonstrating chronic physical health disorders compared 
      to persons without mental illness. IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals must be
      alert to the increased likelihood of comorbid chronic physical disorders in

TI  - Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity
      and disease.
PG  - 1095-119
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside
      in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the
      human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must
      maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive
      to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory
      processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence
      suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence
      susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
      Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased
      incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early
      childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an
      alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant
      immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced
      dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will
      be discussed.

TI  - A 12-week, randomized, controlled trial with a 4-week randomized withdrawal
      period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in irritable bowel
      syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 1714-24; quiz p.1725
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed guanylate cyclase-C agonist. The 
      objective of this trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). METHODS:
      This phase 3, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial randomized
      IBS-C patients to placebo or 290 mu g oral linaclotide once daily in a 12-week
      treatment period, followed by a 4-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period. There
      were four primary end points, the Food and Drug Administration ' s (FDA ' s)
      primary end point for IBS-C (responder: improvement of >/= 30 % in average daily 
      worst abdominal pain score and increase by >/= 1 complete spontaneous bowel
      movement (CSBM) from baseline (same week) for at least 50 % of weeks assessed)
      and three other primary end points, based on improvements in abdominal pain and
      CSBMs for 9 / 12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. RESULTS: The trial
      evaluated 800 patients (mean age = 43.5 years, female = 90.5 % , white = 76.9 %
      ). The FDA end point was met by 136 / 405 linaclotide-treated patients (33.6 % ),
      compared with 83 / 395 placebo-treated patients (21.0 % ) ( P < 0.0001) (number
      needed to treat: 8.0, 95 % confidence interval: 5.4, 15.5). A greater percentage 
      of linaclotide patients, compared with placebo patients, reported for at least 6 
      / 12 treatment period weeks, a reduction of >/= 30 % in abdominal pain (50.1 vs. 
      37.5 % , P = 0.0003) and an increase of >/= 1 CSBM from baseline (48.6 vs. 29.6 %
      , P < 0.0001). A greater percentage of linaclotide patients vs. placebo patients 
      were also responders for the other three primary end points ( P < 0.05).
      Significantly greater improvements were seen in linaclotide vs. placebo patients 
      for all secondary end points ( P < 0.001). During the RW period, patients
      remaining on linaclotide showed sustained improvement; patients re-randomized
      from linaclotide to placebo showed return of symptoms, but without worsening of
      symptoms relative to baseline. Diarrhea, the most common AE, resulted in
      discontinuation of 5.7 % of linaclotide and 0.3 % of placebo patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Linaclotide significantly improved abdominal pain and bowel symptoms
      associated with IBS-C for at least 12 weeks; there was no worsening of symptoms
      compared with baseline following cessation of linaclotide during the RW period.

      safety.
PG  - 1702-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed peptide guanylate cyclase-C
      agonist. The objective of this trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of 
      linaclotide treatment in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation
      (IBS-C) over 26 weeks. METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled trial randomized IBS-C patients to placebo or 290 mug of oral 
      linaclotide once daily for a 26-week treatment period. The primary and the
      secondary efficacy assessments were evaluated over the first 12 weeks of
      treatment. Primary end points included the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's)
      end point for IBS-C (responder: a patient who reported (i) improvement of >/= 30 
      % from baseline in average daily worst abdominal pain score and (ii) increase of 
      >/= 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, both in the same 
      week for >/= 6 / 12 weeks) and three other primary end points, based on
      improvements in abdominal pain and CSBMs for 9/12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs)
      were monitored. RESULTS: In all, 804 patients (mean age = 44 years, female = 90 %
      , white = 78 % ) were evaluated; 33.7 % of linaclotide-treated patients were FDA 
      end point responders, vs. 13.9 % of placebo-treated patients ( P < 0.0001)
      (number needed to treat = 5.1, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 3.9, 7.1). The pain
      responder criterion of the FDA end point was met by 48.9 % of linaclotide-treated
      patients vs. 34.5 % of placebo-treated patients (number needed to treat = 7.0, 95
      % CI: 4.7, 13.1), and the CSBM responder criterion was met by 47.6 % of
      linaclotide-treated patients, vs. 22.6 % of placebo patients (number needed to
      treat = 4.0, 95 % CI: 3.2, 5.4). Remaining primary end points ( P < 0.0001) and
      all secondary end points ( P < 0.001), including abdominal pain, abdominal
      bloating, and bowel symptoms (SBM and CSBM rates, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS)
      score, and straining), were also statistically significantly improved with
      linaclotide vs. placebo. Statistically significant differences from placebo were 
      observed for responder and continuous end points over 26 weeks of treatment. AE
      incidence was similar between treatment groups, except for diarrhea, which caused
      discontinuation in 4.5 % of linaclotide patients vs. 0.2 % of placebo patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Linaclotide 290 mug once daily significantly improved abdominal and 
      bowel symptoms associated with IBS-C over 26 weeks of treatment.

      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - S52-5
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318264e918 [doi]
AB  - There is increasingly convincing evidence supporting the participation of the gut
      microenvironment in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Studies particularly suggest an interplay between luminal factors (eg, foods and 
      bacteria residing in the intestine), the epithelial barrier, and the mucosal
      immune system. Decreased expression and structural rearrangement of tight
      junction proteins in the small bowel and colon leading to increased intestinal
      permeability have been observed, particularly in postinfectious IBS and in IBS
      with diarrhea. These abnormalities are thought to contribute to the outflow of
      antigens through the leaky epithelium, causing overstimulation of the mucosal
      immune system. Accordingly, subsets of patients with IBS show higher numbers and 
      an increased activation of mucosal immunocytes, particularly mast cells. Immune
      factors, released by these cells, including proteases, histamine, and
      prostanoids, participate in the perpetuation of the permeability dysfunction and 
      contribute to the activation of abnormal neural responses involved in abdominal
      pain perception and changes in bowel habits. All these mechanisms represent new
      targets for therapeutic approaches in IBS. Probiotics are an attractive
      therapeutic option in IBS given their recognized safety and by virtue of positive
      biological effects they can exert on the host. Of importance for the IBS
      pathophysiology is that preclinical studies have shown that selective probiotic
      strains exhibit potentially useful properties including anti-inflammatory
      effects, improvement of mucosal barrier homeostasis, beneficial effects on
      intestinal microbiota, and a reduction of visceral hypersensitivity. The effect
      of probiotics on IBS is positive in most randomized, controlled studies, although
      the gain over the placebo is small. Identifying tailored probiotic approaches for
      subgroups of IBS patients represents a challenge for the future.

      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A total of 130 patients were randomly allocated to
      consume, twice daily for 8 wk, either the composite yogurt or the control
      product. The composite yogurt contained acacia dietary fiber and high-dose B.
      lactis together with two classic yogurt starter cultures. Patients were evaluated
      using the visual analog scale via a structured questionnaire administered at
      baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in bowel habit satisfaction
      and overall IBS symptoms from baseline were significantly higher in the test
      group than in the control group (27.16 vs 15.51, P = 0.010, 64.2 +/- 17.0 vs 50.4
      +/- 20.5, P < 0.001; respectively). In constipation-predominant IBS, improvement 
      in overall IBS symptoms was significantly higher in the test group than in the
      control group (72.4 +/- 18.4 vs 50.0 +/- 21.8, P < 0.001). In patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS, improvement in bowel habit satisfaction from baseline
      was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (32.90 vs
      7.81, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that composite yogurt enriched
      with acacia fiber and B. lactis has greater therapeutic effects in patients with 
      IBS than standard yogurt.

AB  - The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome following 
      an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (pos-infectious irritable bowel syndrome)
      illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause
      this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other
      observations, as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the
      enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have,
      somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in irritable bowel syndrome research,
      given their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are
      associated with irritable bowel syndrome. While evidence for immune dysfunction
      both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological
      limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in
      irritable bowel syndrome. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a
      firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in irritable
      bowel syndrome, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency.
      Despite its prevalence, there is a striking lack of effective therapeutic options
      for irritable bowel syndrome. While there is reason for optimism in the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome with several promising new agents
      currently undergoing clinical trials, confirmation of the efficacy and safety of 
      these agents in wider patient populations is awaited. A clearer understanding of 
      the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      of interrelationships between irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal
      and non-gastrointestinal disorders, will likely be required before effective drug
      therapies can be found.

      results from a case-control study.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) seen by a
      gastroenterologist often utilize medications that may alter intestinal
      homeostasis. The question arises whether exposure to these drugs is associated
      with the development of IBS symptoms. Aim of this study was therefore to assess
      the use of PPIs and NSAIDs in patients with IBS versus controls. METHODS: Cases
      of IBS from the last 5 years were reviewed. All patients having had at least one 
      prescription for a particular drug (PPIs, NSAIDs, SSRIs, diuretics, ACE
      inhibitors) in the 6 months prior to the time of initial symptom onset were
      considered exposed. The control group consisted of individuals randomly selected 
      from the general population. RESULTS: 287 cases of IBS were retrieved for
      analysis together with 287 age and sex-matched controls. Exposure to PPIs and
      NSAIDs was significantly higher in IBS patients, whereas no association between
      ACE inhibitor use and IBS was found. PPIs were not significantly associated when 
      excluding patients with gastrointestinal reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. 
      Exposure to SSRIs was also positively associated with IBS, but only when patients
      with psychiatric comorbidity were included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Medications that may alter intestinal homeostasis such as NSAIDs and PPIs were
      more frequently used in IBS patients compared to controls. This association might
      be relevant for everyday clinical practice, but it is remains to be elucidated
      whether this association is of etiological nature.

TI  - Nutrient intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with the
      general population.
PG  - 23-30.e1
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS.
      Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to
      the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups
      based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate 
      if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187
      IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food
      registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control 
      group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic
      Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was 
      similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations.
      Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from
      macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended
      to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher
      daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well
      as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no
      association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food
      items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large
      extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency
      toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy
      products in IBS patients.

AB  - Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a
      considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is
      referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional
      diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of
      coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid
      intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a
      preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of
      underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at 
      decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying
      precipitating food items.

PG  - 581-602
LID - 10.1016/j.gtc.2012.06.002 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal microflora can be considered an organ of the body. It has several
      functions in the human gut, mostly metabolic and immunologic, and constantly
      interacts with the intestinal mucosa in a delicate equilibrium. Chronic diarrhea 
      is associated with an alteration of gut microbiota when a pathogen invades the
      gut and also in several conditions associated with intestinal mucosal damage or
      bowel dysfunction, as in inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or
      small bowel bacterial overgrowth. This article discusses the basis of gut
      microbiota modulation. Evidence for the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation in 
      chronic conditions is also discussed.

AB  - AIM: To assess the symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (L.
      plantarum 299v) (DSM 9843) for the relief of abdominal symptoms in a large subset
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria.
      METHODS: In this double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-designed study,
      subjects were randomized to daily receive either one capsule of L. plantarum 299v
      (DSM 9843) or placebo for 4 wk. Frequency and intensity of abdominal pain,
      bloating and feeling of incomplete rectal emptying were assessed weekly on a
      visual analogue scale while stool frequency was calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      and fourteen IBS patients were recruited. After 4 wk, both pain severity (0.68 + 
      0.53 vs 0.92 + 0.57, P < 0.05) and daily frequency (1.01 + 0.77 vs 1.71 + 0.93, P
      < 0.05) were lower with L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) than with placebo. Similar
      results were obtained for bloating. At week 4, 78.1 % of the patients scored the 
      L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) symptomatic effect as excellent or good vs only 8.1 
      % for placebo (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A 4-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299v
      (DSM 9843) provided effective symptom relief, particularly of abdominal pain and 
      bloating, in IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal
      (GI) tract disorder with significant disability and a considerable financial
      burden to health service due to the consumption of resources including
      investigations, physician time, and cost of treatment. Despite availability of
      multiple treatment options, there is still poor functional recovery. AREAS
      COVERED: Probiotics has been investigated as a promising treatment for IBS, and
      have demonstrated beneficial effects in some patients. There are many clinical
      trials investigating the therapeutic benefits of probiotics in IBS but most of
      them are heterogenic in terms of dose or species used and clinical endpoints.
      However, recent major meta-analyses revealed benefits of probiotics in patients
      with IBS. Inhibition of binding of pathogenic bacteria to intestinal epithelial
      cells, enhancing barrier function of intestinal epithelial, acidification of the 
      colon, suppression of the growth of pathogens, modulation of immunity, inhibition
      of visceral hypersensitivity, alteration in mucosal response to stress, and
      improvement of bowel dysmotility are among mechanisms that probiotics may act.
      Most commonly used probiotics come from the genera Bifidobacterium and
      Lactobacillus but other species are in trial. EXPERT OPINION: Although further
      studies are still needed, current evidences are almost enough to convince experts
      that probiotics are efficient in the treatment of IBS.

AB  - Hygienic and dietology estimation of cereal breakfast (oat muesli and crispbread)
      were carried out on 137 irritable colon syndrome (SRK) patients with functional
      chronic constipation. It is established that inclusion of cereal breakfast in a

      digestive tract and promotes improvement of indicators of carbohydrate and lipid 
      metabolism. It is important for patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes.
      Positive improvements of research allow making a cereal breakfast use
      recommendations: muesli in number of 50 g/days (with milk or kefir), crispbread
      and crunchy snacks in number of 100 g/days in SRK patients with functional
      chronic constipation dietary nutrition.

TI  - Multitargeting by turmeric, the golden spice: From kitchen to clinic.
PG  - 1510-28
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100741 [doi]
AB  - Although much has been published about curcumin, which is obtained from turmeric,
      comparatively little is known about turmeric itself. Turmeric, a golden spice
      obtained from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has been used to give color
      and taste to food preparations since ancient times. Traditionally, this spice has
      been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine for the treatment of such ailments as
      gynecological problems, gastric problems, hepatic disorders, infectious diseases,
      and blood disorders. Modern science has provided the scientific basis for the use
      of turmeric against such disorders. Various chemical constituents have been
      isolated from this spice, including polyphenols, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes,
      triterpenoids, sterols, and alkaloids. Curcumin, which constitutes 2-5% of
      turmeric, is perhaps the most-studied component. Although some of the activities 
      of turmeric can be mimicked by curcumin, other activities are
      curcumin-independent. Cell-based studies have demonstrated the potential of
      turmeric as an antimicrobial, insecticidal, larvicidal, antimutagenic,
      radioprotector, and anticancer agent. Numerous animal studies have shown the
      potential of this spice against proinflammatory diseases, cancer,
      neurodegenerative diseases, depression, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis.
      At the molecular level, this spice has been shown to modulate numerous
      cell-signaling pathways. In clinical trials, turmeric has shown efficacy against 
      numerous human ailments including lupus nephritis, cancer, diabetes, irritable
      bowel syndrome, acne, and fibrosis. Thus, a spice originally common in the
      kitchen is now exhibiting activities in the clinic. In this review, we discuss
      the chemical constituents of turmeric, its biological activities, its molecular
      targets, and its potential in the clinic.

      of life.
PG  - 349-58
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1552-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised
      placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain
      symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is
      only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS.
      METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The
      primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and
      bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of
      treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in
      abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale,
      stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale
      and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time
      (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS
      patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were
      studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of
      treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of
      responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the
      treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in
      most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This
      symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of
      flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect
      profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory
      relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.

TI  - [Variation of intestinal fermentative profile after sequential therapy with
      rifaximin/probiotics].
PG  - 99-104
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is evidence suggesting that intestinal microbiota plays a
      role in the development of irritable bowel syndrome. Its activity can be
      indirectly assessed using the lactulose breath test. Antibiotics like rifaximin
      or probiotics can be used as therapeutic options for patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome. Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of a sequential
      treatment with rifaximin and probiotics in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      We prospectively evaluated patients with diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome
      according to Rome III criteria. Included patients had to fill in a questionnaire 
      in order to assess their symptoms severity. A lactulose breath test was also
      performed in each case and a curve with the results of hydrogen concentration and
      time was elaborated. Then, the area under the curve was calculated After initial 
      evaluation, patients received a seven-day treatment with rifaximin, followed by a
      ten-day course of probiotics. Thirty days after completion of treatment a new
      lactulose breath test along with a questionnaire were performed. RESULTS: We
      included 15 patients and 93% experienced a significant improvement of their
      symptoms as well as a significant reduction of the lactulose breath test values. 
      CONCLUSION: Sequential treatment with rifaximin/probiotics seems to be effective 
      for symptom and fermentative profile improvement in irritable bowel syndrome
      patients.

AB  - Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota 
      have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ
      principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ
      on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the
      identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the
      identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different
      species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of
      these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a
      balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced
      composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not
      only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with
      the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities
      have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases,
      including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory
      bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. Recognition of the strong potential for
      food to manipulate microbiota composition has opened up new therapeutic
      strategies against these diseases based on dietary intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of biocomplexes "Normoflorin L,
      B" in the treatment of functional bowel disease with constipation syndrome. The
      study involved 30 patients with functional bowel disease (Rome criteria III,
      2006), with irritable bowel syndrome with predominance of constipatio--16 people 
      with functional constipation--14 people. The criteria of efficacy were: the
      dynamics of clinical symptoms, bacteriological examination of feces before and
      after treatment, intestinal transit time of Activated Charcoa- "carbolen" test
      the definition of short-chain fatty acids (SFA) in the feces by gas-liquid
      chromatography before and after treatment. The results of the study. In
      Normoflorin therapy there comes normalization of intestinal motor activity;
      positive changes in colon ecosystem, consisting of changes of methabolic activity
      of colonic microflora and its generic composition, normalization of
      anaerobic-aerobic relations, restoration of intracavitary redox potential of the 
      luminal environment; eliminating the symptoms of intestinal dyspepsia (rumbling, 
      flatulence). Bio-complexes Normofloriny are characterized by good tolerability
      and safety. The positive effect of "aftereffect" of drugs persists for at least 2
      weeks. These data allow us to recommend the use of bio-complexes Normofloriny in 
      treatment of functional bowel disease. These data allow to recommend the use of
      bio-complexes Normofloriny in treatment of functional bowel disease.

TI  - Non-celiac wheat sensitivity diagnosed by double-blind placebo-controlled
      challenge: exploring a new clinical entity.
PG  - 1898-906; quiz 1907
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.236 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (WS) is considered a new clinical
      entity. An increasing percentage of the general population avoids gluten
      ingestion. However, the real existence of this condition is debated and specific 
      markers are lacking. Our aim was thus to demonstrate the existence of WS and
      define its clinical, serologic, and histological markers. METHODS: We reviewed
      the clinical charts of all subjects with an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      presentation who had been diagnosed with WS using a double-blind
      placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge in the years 2001-2011. One hundred celiac
      disease (CD) patients and fifty IBS patients served as controls. RESULTS: Two
      hundred and seventy-six patients with WS, as diagnosed by DBPC challenge, were
      included. Two groups showing distinct clinical characteristics were identified:
      WS alone (group 1) and WS associated with multiple food hypersensitivity (group
      2). As a whole group, the WS patients showed a higher frequency of anemia, weight
      loss, self-reported wheat intolerance, coexistent atopy, and food allergy in
      infancy than the IBS controls. There was also a higher frequency of positive
      serum assays for IgG/IgA anti-gliadin and cytometric basophil activation in "in
      vitro" assay. The main histology characteristic of WS patients was eosinophil
      infiltration of the duodenal and colon mucosa. Patients with WS alone were
      characterized by clinical features very similar to those found in CD patients.
      Patients with multiple food sensitivity were characterized by clinical features
      similar to those found in allergic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the
      existence of non-celiac WS as a distinct clinical condition. We also suggest the 
      existence of two distinct populations of subjects with WS: one with
      characteristics more similar to CD and the other with characteristics pointing to
      food allergy.

TI  - Intestinal gas: has diet anything to do in the absence of a demonstrable
      malabsorption state?
PG  - 489-93
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328356662d [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the relevant publications during the last 12
      months supporting that diet can influence gas-related symptoms in the absence of 
      a malabsorption state. RECENT FINDINGS: Gas symptoms during carbohydrate
      fermentation: a diet incorporating beans is well tolerated by a majority of
      individuals involved in a program of heart disease biomarkers. By contrast, in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a diet avoiding fermentable carbohydrates
      improved gas-related abdominal symptoms. The rate of fermentation determines the 
      production of abdominal symptoms, and many slowly fermentable fibers have a rapid
      fermentation profile that can generate abdominal symptoms. Modulation of visceral
      sensitivity: diet can influence gas symptoms by increasing the tolerability of
      the intestine to gas. Capsaicin decreases visceral hyperalgesia and improved
      bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Changes in gas-producing
      bacteria: different strains of Lactobacillus have antimicrobial properties
      against gas-forming coliforms. New clinical studies show beneficial effects of
      prebiotics and probiotics on abdominal bloating. SUMMARY: Actual data suggest
      that diet could improve gas-related abdominal symptoms acting on several
      mechanisms: gas production, visceral hypersensitivity and modulation of
      gas-producing enteric bacteria.

TI  - Diverticular disease as a chronic illness: evolving epidemiologic and clinical
      insights.
PG  - 1486-93
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.194 [doi]
AB  - Diverticular disease imposes a significant burden on Western and industrialized
      societies. The traditional pathogenesis model posits that low dietary fiber
      predisposes to diverticulosis, and fecalith obstruction prompts acute
      diverticulitis that is managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics or surgery.
      However, a growing body of knowledge is shifting the paradigm of diverticular
      disease from an acute surgical illness to a chronic bowel disorder composed of
      recurrent abdominal symptoms and considerable psychosocial impact. New research
      implicates a role for low-grade inflammation, sensory-motor nerve damage, and
      dysbiosis in a clinical picture that mimics irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      even inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Far from being an isolated event, acute
      diverticulitis may be the catalyst for chronic symptoms including abdominal pain,
      cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and "post-diverticulitis IBS." In
      addition, studies reveal lower health-related quality of life in patients with
      chronic diverticular disease vs. controls. Health-care providers should maintain 
      a high index of suspicion for the multifaceted presentations of diverticular
      disease, and remain aware that it might contribute to long-term emotional
      distress beyond traditional diverticulitis attacks. These developments are
      prompting a shift in therapeutic approaches from widespread antimicrobials and
      supportive care to the use of probiotics, mesalamine, and gut-directed
      antibiotics. This review addresses the emerging literature regarding
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of chronic, symptomatic
      diverticular disease, and provides current answers to common clinical questions.

LID - 10.3945/jn.112.159285 [doi]
AB  - Preliminary studies indicate that dietary restriction of fermentable short-chain 
      carbohydrates improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Prebiotic
      fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides stimulate colonic
      bifidobacteria. However, the effect of restricting fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has never been examined.
      This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of fermentable 
      carbohydrate restriction on luminal microbiota, SCFA, and GI symptoms in patients
      with IBS. Patients with IBS were randomized to the intervention diet or habitual 
      diet for 4 wk. The incidence and severity of symptoms and stool output were
      recorded for 7 d at baseline and follow-up. A stool sample was collected and
      analyzed for bacterial groups using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Of 41
      patients randomized, 6 were withdrawn. At follow-up, there was lower intake of
      total short-chain fermentable carbohydrates in the intervention group compared
      with controls (P = 0.001). The total luminal bacteria at follow-up did not differ
      between groups; however, there were lower concentrations (P < 0.001) and
      proportions (P < 0.001) of bifidobacteria in the intervention group compared with
      controls when adjusted for baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, more
      patients in the intervention group reported adequate control of symptoms (13/19, 
      68%) compared with controls (5/22, 23%; P = 0.005). This randomized controlled
      trial demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal
      bifidobacteria after 4 wk of fermentable carbohydrate restriction. Although the
      intervention was effective in managing IBS symptoms, the implications of its
      effect on the GI microbiota are still to be determined.

AB  - It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important
      elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The
      most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a
      bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in
      the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the
      evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The
      introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major
      advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from
      16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and 
      qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS.
      Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS.
      The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal
      innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate
      nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we
      await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic
      target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics,
      probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although
      most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the
      authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the
      pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of
      microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on 
      modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.

      study.
PG  - 627-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study bowel patterns (function/habits) and its associated variables
      in an adult Saudi population. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, a 21-item
      questionnaire on bowel function (habits and frequency) was distributed to 10,000 
      high school students from all 5 regions of Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, between
      February and April 2011. The randomly selected students, and 2 of their household
      or family members completed the questionnaire. Socio-demographic characteristics,
      eating habits, chronic diseases, and medications used were studied. RESULTS:
      Sixty-one percent (N=4918) were above the age of 16 years, of which 51.5% were
      males, and 88.1% were Saudis. It was observed that 18.1% of respondents perceived
      their bowel movements as being irregular and abnormal. There was no association
      between gender and abnormal/irregular bowel movement (OR: 0.89; p=0.13).
      Individuals over 60 years suffered from bowel pattern abnormalities (OR=1.8;
      p=0.01). Educational status (secondary), occupation (teacher and unemployed),
      diet habits, and chronic diseases of study subjects were also statistically
      significantly associated with their bowel movements. Respondents consuming more
      vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy products, and rice had significantly more normal
      bowel movements. Females tended to defecate less frequently as compared with
      males (p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of both genders have bowel movements at least
      once a day. CONCLUSION: Our results may serve as a baseline for appropriate
      intervention strategies, and also for future studies to substantiate, negate, or 
      add more observations/conclusions.

AB  - The functional colopathies are frequent in digestive pathology and are
      particularly badly felt by African patients. The authors, after the determination
      of the masticatory efficiency score (classification of Verkindere) of 100
      subjects affected by colopathies and diagnosed in the service of gastroenterology
      of Cocody University Hospital (Abidjan), attempt to determine the importance of
      the masticatory deficiency in functional colopathies. Among the toothless
      subjects with functional colopathies, the restoration of the masticatory
      efficiency by functional prosthetic rehabilitation constitutes an essential
      therapeutic act in the reduction of the symptoms of the functional colopathies
      and the improvement of the comfort of the patients. Patients' global care raises 
      the interest of collaboration between odontologists and gastroenterologists for
      an efficient treatment.

TI  - IBS-associated phylogenetic unbalances of the intestinal microbiota are not
      reverted by probiotic supplementation.
PG  - 406-13
AB  - IBS is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder, in which the microbiota 
      has been demonstrated to play a role. An increasing number of studies have
      suggested how probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms and several mechanisms of
      action have been proposed. In the present study we characterized the intestinal
      microbiota of 19 subjects suffering from diagnosed IBS using a fully validated
      High Taxonomic Fingerprint Microbiota Array (HTF-Microbi.Array). We demonstrated 
      that the IBS microbiota is different from that of healthy individuals due to an
      unbalance in a number of commensal species, with an increase in relative
      abundance of lactobacilli, B. cereus and B. clausii, bifidobacteria, Clostridium 
      cluster IX and E. rectale, and a decrease in abundance of Bacteroides/Prevotella 
      group and Veillonella genus. Additionally, we demonstrated that some bacterial
      groups of the human intestinal microbiota, recently defined as pathobionts, are
      increased in concentration in the IBS microbiota. Furthermore, we aimed at
      investigating if the daily administration of a novel probiotic yogurt containing 
      B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 and K. marxianus B0399, recently demonstrated to
      have beneficial effects in the management of IBS symptoms, could impact on the
      biostructure of IBS microbiota, modulating its composition to counteract putative
      dysbiosis found in IBS subjects. Notably, we demonstrated that the beneficial
      effects associated to the probiotic preparation are not related to significant
      modifications in the composition of the human intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Effects of linseeds on the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: a pilot
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 435-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01263.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Manipulation of dietary fibre intake represents a longstanding
      treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly for
      those with constipation. Linseeds are often recommended by both clinicians and
      dietitians as a source of dietary fibre to alleviate symptoms. Recent guidance on
      the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) advises that linseeds may reduce
      wind and bloating, although there is limited clinical evidence to support this
      recommendation. The present pilot study aimed to compare the clinical
      effectiveness of: (i) whole linseeds versus ground linseeds; (ii) whole linseeds 
      versus no linseeds; and (iii) ground linseeds versus no linseeds in the
      management of IBS symptoms. METHODS: In an open randomised controlled trial,
      subjects with IBS (n = 40) were allocated to one of three intervention groups:
      two tablespoons of whole linseeds per day (n = 14), two tablespoons of ground
      linseeds per day (n = 13) and no linseeds as controls (n = 13). Symptom severity 
      (primary outcome) and bowel habit were assessed before and after a 4-week
      intervention and statistical differences between the groups were compared.
      RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the present study. Between-group analysis 
      comparing the improvement in symptom severity did not reach statistical
      significance for whole linseeds (n = 11) versus ground linseeds (n = 11; P =
      0.62), whole linseeds versus controls (n = 9; P = 0.12) and ground linseeds
      versus controls (P = 0.10). There were no significant changes in stool frequency 
      or stool consistency for any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linseeds may be useful
      in relief of IBS symptoms. Further research is needed to detect clear differences
      between the effects of whole and ground linseeds.

TI  - Marine bioactives: pharmacological properties and potential applications against 
      inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 812-33
LID - 10.3390/md10040812 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in
      inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis,
      diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease,
      Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the
      past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually
      the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may
      lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation
      of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an
      influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of
      the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is
      not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been
      implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the
      antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of
      oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing
      antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic
      substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related
      oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped
      reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for
      exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such 
      as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of
      health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic
      and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining
      attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory
      degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published
      studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of
      many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.

LID - 10.1186/1756-6606-5-19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain contains both sensory and affective dimensions. Using a rodent
      visceral pain assay that combines the colorectal distension (CRD) model with the 
      conditioned place avoidance (CPA) paradigms, we measured a learned behavior that 
      directly reflects the affective component of visceral pain, and showed that
      perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) activation is critical for memory
      processing involved in long-term visceral affective state and prediction of
      aversive stimuli by contextual cue. Progress has been made and suggested that
      activation of vagal afferents plays a role in the behavioral control nociception 
      and memory storage processes.In human patients, electrical vagus nerve
      stimulation enhanced retention of verbal learning performance.

      during feeding, has been shown to enhance memory retention. Mice access to food
      immediately after training session enhanced memory retention. It has been well
      demonstrated that CCK acting on vagal afferent fibers mediates various
      physiological functions. We hypothesize that CCK activation of vagal afferent
      enhances visceral pain-related affective memory. RESULTS: In the presented study,
      infusion of CCK-8 at physiological concentration combining with conditional
      training significantly increased the CRD-induced CPA scores, and enhanced the
      pain affective memory retention. In contrast, CCK had no effect on CPA induced by
      non-nociceptive aversive stimulus (U69,593). The physiological implications were 
      further strengthened by the similar effects observed in the rats with duodenal
      infusion of 5% peptone, which has been shown to induce increases in plasma CCK
      levels. CCK-8 receptor antagonist CR-1409 or perivagal application of capsaicin
      abolished the effect of CCK on aversive visceral pain memory, which was
      consistent with the notion that vagal afferent modulates affective aspects of
      visceral pain. CCK does not change the nociceptive response (visceral pain
      sensitivity) and anterior cingulate cortex neuronal responses to CRD. CONCLUSION:
      CCK activating vagal afferent C fibers enhances memory consolidation and
      retention involved in long-term visceral negative affective state. Thus, in a
      number of gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, nutrient 
      content may contribute to painful visceral perception by enhancing visceral
      aversive memory via acts on vagal afferent pathway.

TI  - Tianeptine vs amitriptyline for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with
      diarrhea: a multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled
      study.
PG  - 860-e398
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01945.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tricyclic antidepressants have good efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), but their clinical use is limited by
      considerations of tolerability. Tianeptine, another antidepressant, acts as a
      selective serotonin reuptake enhancer. We compared tianeptine with amitriptyline 
      for the treatment of patients with IBS-D. METHODS: We undertook a multicenter,
      randomized, open-label, non-inferiority clinical study that compared tianeptine
      with amitriptyline, each in combination with probiotics, for the treatment of
      IBS-D. Subjects were randomized to receive tianeptine (37.5 mg)/probiotics
      (Bacillus subtilis + Streptococcus faecium) or amitriptyline (10 mg)/probiotics
      (Bacillus subtilis + Streptococcus faecium) for 4 weeks. A total of 228 patients 
      were analyzed by the intention-to-treat approach. The primary efficacy endpoint
      was the proportion of patients who had global relief of IBS symptoms at week 4.
      The secondary efficacy endpoints were intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      stool frequency/consistency, quality of life, and overall satisfaction with
      treatment. KEY RESULTS: At week 4, non-inferiority of the tianeptine group to the
      amitriptyline group (treatment difference -15.1%; 95% CI -26.6% to -3.8%) was
      shown, with 81.1% (99 of 122 patients) of the patients in the tianeptine group
      and 66.0% (70 of 106 patients) in the amitriptyline group reporting global relief
      of IBS symptoms. The secondary endpoints also demonstrated non-inferiority of the
      tianeptine group to the amitriptyline group. Adverse events such as dry mouth and
      constipation were significantly lower in the tianeptine group than the
      amitriptyline group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Tianeptine is not
      inferior to amitriptyline for treating IBS-D in terms of both efficacy and
      tolerability.

TI  - [Comparison of the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture and probiotics
      combined with deanxit in treating diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 594-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture and
      probiotics combine Deanxit in treating diarrhea predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (D-IBS). METHODS: Totally 64 D-IBS patients accompanied with anxiety
      and/or depression were randomly assigned to the Western medicine group (Group A) 
      and the electroacupuncture (EA) group (Group B), 30 patients in Group A and 34
      patients in Group B. Patients in Group A took Bacillus licheniformis and Deanxit,
      while those in Group B received EA. Four weeks consisted of one therapeutic
      course. Three-month follow-up was carried out. The scoring for the digestive
      tract symptoms, HAMA score, and HAMD score were evaluated before and after
      treatment. The recurrence in the 3-month follow-up was also observed. RESULTS:
      The total effect rate was 86.67% in Group A and 88.24% in Group B with no
      statistical difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was statistical
      difference in the scoring for the digestive tract symptoms, HAMA score, and HAMD 
      score (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the
      improvement of defecation frequency score, HAMA score, HAMD score between the two
      groups after treatment (P > 0.05). Better effects on improving abdominal pain
      score and abdominal distention score was obtained in Group B (P < 0.01), while
      better effects on improving the stool form score and mucus score were obtained in
      Group A (P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the recurrence rate
      between the two groups within the two-month follow-up (P > 0.05). The recurrence 
      rate within the 3-month follow-up was obviously lower in Group B than in Group A 
      (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EA and Western medicine (probiotics combined Deanxit)
      could effectively treat D-IBS patients accompanied with anxiety and/or
      depression. Both of them had different superiorities in improving symptoms. But
      EA had better long-term therapeutic effects.

TI  - Diet in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome: a cross-sectional study in the
      general population.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-61 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often relate symptoms to
      the intake of certain foods. This study assesses differences in diet in subjects 
      with and without IBS. METHODS: The cross-sectional, population-based study was
      conducted in Norway in 2001. Out of 11078 invited subjects, 4621 completed a
      survey about abdominal complaints and intake of common food items. IBS and IBS
      subgroups were classified according to Rome II criteria. RESULTS: IBS was
      diagnosed in 388 subjects (8.4%) and, of these, 26.5% had
      constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), 44.8% alternating IBS (A-IBS), and 28.6%
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Low intake of dairy products (portions/day)
      (Odds Ratio 0.85 [CI 0.78 to 0.93], p = 0.001) and high intake of water (100
      ml/day) (1.08 [1.02 to 1.15], p = 0.002), tea (1.05 [1.01 to 1.10], p = 0.019)
      and carbonated beverages (1.07 [1.01 to 1.14], p = 0.023) were associated with
      IBS. A lower intake of dairy products and a higher intake of alcohol and
      carbonated beverages were associated with D-IBS and a higher intake of water and 
      tea was associated with A-IBS. In subjects with IBS the severity of symptoms was 
      associated with a higher intake of vegetables and potatoes in subjects with
      C-IBS, with a higher intake of vegetables in subjects with A-IBS, and with a
      higher intake of fruits and berries, carbonated beverages and alcohol in subjects
      with D-IBS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the diet differed in subjects with and
      without IBS and between IBS subgroups and was associated with the severity of
      symptoms.

AB  - Unexpected, urgent, sometimes painful bowel movements after eating are common
      complaints among adults. Without a clear etiology, if pain is present and
      resolves with the movements, this is usually labeled "irritable bowel
      syndrome-diarrhea" based solely on symptoms. If this symptom-based approach is
      applied exclusively, it may lead physicians not to consider treatable conditions:
      celiac disease, or maldigestion due to bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic
      exocrine insufficiency, or an a-glucosidase (sucrase, glucoamylase, maltase, or
      isomaltase) deficiency. These conditions can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel
      syndrome-diarrhea (or functional diarrhea, if pain is not present). Limited
      testing is currently available to confirm these conditions (antibody screens for 
      celiac disease; fecal fat as a surrogate marker for pancreatic function).
      Therefore, empirical treatment with alpha amylase, pancreatic enzymes, or a bile 
      acid-binding agent may simultaneously treat these patients and serve as a
      surrogate diagnostic test. This review will summarize the current evidence for
      bile acid malabsorption, and deficiencies of pancreatic enzymes or a-glucosidases
      as potential causes for postprandial diarrhea, and provide an algorithm for
      treatment options.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: methods, mechanisms, and pathophysiology. Methods to
      assess visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, 
      characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort in combination with
      disturbed bowel habits in the absence of identifiable organic cause. Visceral
      hypersensitivity has emerged as a key hypothesis in explaining the painful
      symptoms in IBS and has been proposed as a "biological hallmark" for the
      condition. Current techniques of assessing visceral perception include the
      computerized barostat using rectal distensions, registering responses induced by 
      sensory stimuli including the flexor reflex and cerebral evoked potentials, as
      well as brain imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
      and positron emission tomography. These methods have provided further insight
      into alterations in pain processing in IBS, although the most optimal method and 
      condition remain to be established. In an attempt to give an overview of these
      methods, a literature search in the electronic databases PubMed and MEDLINE was
      executed using the search terms "assessment of visceral pain/visceral
      nociception/visceral hypersensitivity" and "irritable bowel syndrome." Both
      original articles and review articles were considered for data extraction. This
      review aims to discuss currently used modalities in assessing visceral
      perception, along with advantages and limitations, and aims also to define future
      directions for methodological aspects in visceral pain research. Although novel
      paradigms such as brain imaging and neurophysiological recordings have been
      introduced in the study of visceral pain, confirmative studies are warranted to
      establish their robustness and clinical relevance. Therefore, subjective verbal
      reporting following rectal distension currently remains the best-validated
      technique in assessing visceral perception in IBS.

TI  - Functional bowel symptoms, fibromyalgia and fatigue: a food-induced triad?
PG  - 914-9
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.690045 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with perceived food hypersensitivity typically present with
      multiple health complaints. We aimed to assess the severity of their intestinal
      and extra-intestinal symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 84 
      patients referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation of perceived food
      hypersensitivity were enrolled consecutively. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was 
      diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Severity and impact of bowel
      symptoms, fatigue and musculoskeletal pain were evaluated by using the following 
      questionnaires: The IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), the Fatigue Impact
      Scale (FIS), the FibroFatigue Scale (FFS), and visual analogue scales (VAS) for
      scoring of musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: All but one patient were diagnosed with
      IBS, 58% with severe symptoms. Extra-intestinal symptoms suggestive of chronic
      fatigue and fibromyalgia were demonstrated in 85% and 71%, respectively. Neither 
      IgE-mediated food allergy nor organic pathology could explain the patients'
      symptoms. Nevertheless, malabsorption of fat was demonstrated in 10 of 38
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food hypersensitivity may be associated with
      severe, debilitating illness. The comorbid triad of IBS, chronic fatigue, and
      musculoskeletal pain is striking and may point to a common underlying cause.

PG  - 1290-4
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.040568-0 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, typically chronic and sometimes
      disabling gastrointestinal condition of uncertain aetiology. Recently, a variety 
      of links to gastrointestinal infections have been described including the onset
      of IBS following exposure to enteric pathogens and an apparent predisposition to 
      gastrointestinal infection. The prevalence of Clostridium difficile in a
      population of IBS outpatients (n = 87) in the absence of established risk factors
      for the acquisition of C. difficile infection was examined. Overall, 5.7 % of
      patients (n = 5) carried culturable C. difficile and 4.6 % (n = 4) of isolates
      were toxigenic, belonging to toxinotype group 0, compared with 1.1 % (n = 1) for 
      the healthy control group (n = 88). These isolates were members of toxigenic PCR 
      ribotype groups 005 and 050 (IBS group) and 062 (control group) and were
      identified further as three individual strains by PFGE. Although no significant
      difference was observed between IBS patients and healthy volunteers, these
      findings support the concept that a subpopulation of IBS patients may be
      susceptible to gastrointestinal infection.

TI  - Efficacy and safety profile of LCR35 complete freeze-dried culture in irritable
      bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 2067-75
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i17.2067 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the effects and safety of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus LCR35
      complete freeze-dried culture (LCR35) in patients suffering from irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in 
      50 patients complaining of IBS symptoms complying with Rome III criteria.
      Patients were allocated to receive either LCR35 (n = 25) at a minimum daily dose 
      of 6 x 10(8) colony forming units or placebo (n = 25) for 4 wk. At inclusion,
      after treatment and 2 wk later, patients completed the IBS severity scale. Change
      from baseline in the IBS severity score at the end of treatment was the primary
      efficacy criterion. Changes were compared between groups in the whole population 
      and in IBS subtypes (IBS with predominance of constipation, IBS with predominance
      of diarrhoea, mixed IBS, unsubtyped IBS). The presence of lactobacillus casei
      rhamnosus in stools was investigated at inclusion and at the end of treatment.
      The gastrointestinal quality of life questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and
      depression (HAD) scale were also completed. RESULTS: Both groups were balanced
      for baseline characteristics. In 85% of patients, stool analyses showed that
      lactobacillus casei rhamnosus able to survive in the digestive tract. In the
      whole population, improvements in the IBS severity score did not differ
      significantly between treatments with a 25% decrease after 4-wk treatment, and a 
      15% decrease from baseline 2 wk later in both groups. In IBS subgroups,
      statistical analysis could not be performed due to small sample size, but a
      clinical response in favour of LCR35 was observed in IBS patients with
      predominance of diarrhoea: no change in the symptom severity score was seen with 
      the placebo after 4 wk treatment, whereas a clinically relevant decrease occurred
      with LCR35 (-37% vs -3%). Furthermore, in spite of an increase in symptom
      intensity, the IBS severity score was maintained below the baseline value 2 wk
      later with LCR35 (-19% from baseline), whilst a slight 5% increase from baseline 
      was observed with placebo. In the IBS subgroup with predominance of diarrhoea
      only, a clinically relevant decrease in abdominal pain severity score (-36%) was 
      observed with LCR35, whereas no change occurred with placebo. In mixed IBS
      patients, the 20% and 30% decreases in the IBS severity score observed after
      treatment with LCR35 and placebo, respectively, were maintained 2 wk later in
      both groups. A clinical response slightly in favour of placebo was observed at
      the end of the treatment period in IBS patients with predominance of constipation
      (-41% vs -20%) and unsubtyped IBS patients (-47% vs -17%), with the same value
      maintained 2 wk later. In both groups, no clinically relevant changes were
      observed either for the gastrointestinal quality of life index or HAD score.
      Thus, these results suggest that sub-grouping of IBS patients may be important
      for optimizing treatment responses by the physician. CONCLUSION: This pilot study
      suggests that LCR35 could have some efficacy in IBS patients complaining of
      diarrhoea. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in larger studies.

PG  - e34938
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific
      gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease
      prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for
      treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with
      differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed.
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included randomized controlled trials in humans
      that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of Pouchitis,
      Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium
      difficile Disease, Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, Traveler's Diarrhea, or
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis. Random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy
      as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic
      species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of
      treatment. Probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight
      gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (CI) 0.51-0.65). Six 
      of the eight diseases: Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, 
      Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, and Antibiotic Associated
      Diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. Traveler's Diarrhea and
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. Of the
      11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except
      for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium
      infantis. Across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects
      of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and 
      treatment lengths. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics are generally beneficial 
      in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Efficacy was not
      observed for Traveler's Diarrhea or Necrotizing Enterocolitis or for the
      probiotic species L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and B. infantis. When choosing to
      use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the
      type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to 
      take into consideration.

TI  - Revisiting concepts of visceral nociception in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1444-54
LID - 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2012.00147.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder
      characterized by abdominal pain related to defecation with a change in bowel
      habit. Patients with IBS often exhibit increased visceral sensitivity, which can 
      be tested clinically by rectal balloon distension procedures. This paper aims to 
      give an overview of mechanisms involved in visceral hypersensitivity in IBS by
      reviewing recent literature. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: A literature search in
      the electronic databases Pubmed and MEDLINE was executed using the search terms
      'visceral pain' or 'visceral nociception' or 'visceral hypersensitivity' and
      'irritable bowel syndrome.' Both original articles and review articles were
      considered for data extraction. RESULTS: Recent advances in molecular
      neurophysiology provide knowledge to better understand the underlying mechanism
      in pain generation in the human gut, in particular, in IBS patients.
      Sensitization of peripheral nociceptive afferents, more specifically
      high-threshold afferents, has been proposed as one of the principle mechanism in 
      the development of visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, central
      mechanisms also play an important role. In terms of clinical testing of visceral 
      perception, considerable discrepancies remain, however, across different centres.
      CONCLUSION: Alterations in the modulatory balance of pro- and antinociceptive
      central processing of noxious peripheral input may serve as in integrative
      hypothesis for explaining visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Nevertheless, it
      remains troublesome to estimate the contribution of central and peripheral
      factors in visceral hypersensitivity, posing a challenge in determining effective
      therapeutic entities.

TI  - A gastroenterologist's guide to probiotics.
PG  - 960-8

AB  - The enteric microbiota contribute to gastrointestinal health, and their
      disruption has been associated with many disease states. Some patients consume
      probiotic products in attempts to manipulate the intestinal microbiota for health
      benefit. It is important for gastroenterologists to improve their understanding
      of the mechanisms of probiotics and the evidence that support their use in
      practice. Clinical trials have assessed the therapeutic effects of probiotic
      agents for several disorders, including antibiotic- or Clostridium
      difficile-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and the inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Although probiotic research is a rapidly evolving field, there
      are sufficient data to justify a trial of probiotics for treatment or prevention 
      of some of these conditions. However, the capacity of probiotics to modify
      disease symptoms is likely to be modest and varies among probiotic strains-not
      all probiotics are right for all diseases. The current review provides
      condition-specific rationale for using probiotic therapy and literature-based
      recommendations.

TI  - Probiotics in the gastrointestinal diseases of the elderly.
PG  - 402-10
AB  - Changes of the gut microflora in elderly appear to involve a reduction in numbers
      of healthy bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and an increase in numbers 
      of potentially pathogenic species. These changes are generally described as
      gastrointestinal disorders and infections. This review analyses benefits of
      probiotics in old people, with particular interesting for the latest researches
      relevant to elderly people, e.g. trials examining enteric infections,
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea,
      functional bowel problems (constipation and irritable bowel syndrome),
      inflammatory bowel diseases, stimulation of the immune system and prevention of
      cancer. A growing number of researches indicates that some probiotic strains may 
      help to maintain the health in old people, suggesting both health and cost-saving
      benefits in offering fermented dairy products. These benefits include:
      establishment of balanced intestinal microflora; improving colonization
      resistance and or prevention of diarrhea; reduction of fecal enzymes; reduction
      of serum cholesterol; reduction of potential mutagenes; reduction of lactose
      intolerance; synthesis of vitamins; predigestion of proteins.

TI  - British Dietetic Association evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management
      of irritable bowel syndrome in adults.
PG  - 260-74
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01242.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional
      gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management
      strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects
      of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based
      guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet 
      and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These
      included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP),
      fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or
      elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant
      studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic
      database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and
      Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and
      research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically 
      appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of
      treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary
      management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy 
      eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP.
      Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP,
      fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical
      diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for
      adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS:
      These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful 
      dietary management of IBS.

AB  - There is now an expanding volume of evidence to support the view that commensal
      organisms within the gut play a role in early programming and later responsivity 
      of the stress system. The gut is inhabited by 10(1)(3)-10(1)(4) micro-organisms, 
      which is ten times the number of cells in the human body and contains 150 times
      as many genes as our genome. It has long been recognised that gut pathogens such 
      as Escherichia coli, if they enter the gut can activate the HPA. However, animals
      raised in a germ-free environment show exaggerated HPA responses to psychological
      stress, which normalises with monocolonisation by certain bacterial species
      including Bifidobacterium infantis. Moreover, increased evidence suggests that
      animals treated with probiotics have a blunted HPA response. Stress induces
      increased permeability of the gut allowing bacteria and bacterial antigens to
      cross the epithelial barrier and activate a mucosal immune response, which in
      turn alters the composition of the microbiome and leads to enhanced HPA drive.
      Increasing data from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and major depression 
      indicate that in these syndromes alteration of the HPA may be induced by
      increased gut permeability. In the case of irritable bowel syndrome the increased
      permeability can respond to probiotic therapy. Detailed prospective studies in
      patients with mood disorders examining the gut microbiota, immune parameters and 
      HPA activity are required to throw further light on this emerging area. It is
      however clear that the gut microbiota must be taken into account when considering
      the factors regulating the HPA.

AB  - The human body is home to more than 1 trillion microbes, with the
      gastrointestinal tract alone harboring a diverse array of commensal microbes that
      are believed to contribute to host nutrition, developmental regulation of
      intestinal angiogenesis, protection from pathogens, and development of the immune
      response. Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies and metagenomic
      analysis are providing a broader understanding of these resident microbes and
      highlighting differences between healthy and disease states. The aim of this
      review is to provide a detailed summary of current pediatric microbiome studies
      in the literature, in addition to highlighting recent findings and advancements
      in studies of the adult microbiome. This review also seeks to elucidate the
      development of, and factors that could lead to changes in, the composition and
      function of the human microbiome.

AB  - This article describes changes in the basic digestive functions (motility,
      secretion, intraluminal digestion, absorption) that occur during aging. Elderly
      individuals frequently have oropharyngeal muscle dysmotility and altered
      swallowing of food. Reductions in esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal
      sphincter (LES) pressures are also more common in the aged and may cause
      gastroesophageal reflux. Gastric motility and emptying and small bowel motility
      are generally normal in elderly subjects, although delayed motility and gastric
      emptying have been reported in some cases. The propulsive motility of the colon
      is also decreased, and this alteration is associated with neurological and
      endocrine-paracrine changes in the colonic wall. Decreased gastric secretions
      (acid, pepsin) and impairment of the mucous-bicarbonate barrier are frequently
      described in the elderly and may lead to gastric ulcer. Exocrine pancreatic
      secretion is often decreased, as is the bile salt content of bile. These changes 
      represent the underlying mechanisms of symptomatic gastrointestinal dysfunctions 
      in the elderly, such as dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, primary
      dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, primary constipation, maldigestion, and
      reduced absorption of nutrients. Therapeutic management of these conditions is
      also described. The authors also review the gastrointestinal diseases that are
      more common in the elderly, such as atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colon
      diverticulosis, malignant tumors, gallstones, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis,
      Hepato Cellular Carcinoma (HCC), and chronic pancreatitis.

AB  - Chronic constipation is a highly prevalent, heterogeneous disorder that
      significantly affects patients' lives. Nearly 15% of the U.S. population meets
      diagnostic criteria for chronic constipation (1). Chronic constipation reduces
      patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the
      healthcare system (2, 3). A number of therapeutic options are currently available
      to treat symptoms of chronic constipation, although they are not universally
      successful (4, 5). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is another common functional
      gastrointestinal disorder, with a prevalence rate estimated at up to 12% in the
      U.S. (6). Similar to chronic constipation, IBS imposes a significant impact on
      both the healthcare system and the individual patient (7-12). Currently, only one
      medication (lubiprostone) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      for the treatment of IBS with constipation (IBS-C), and is approved only for
      women (13). Although effective in many patients, it is not universally effective 
      for the treatment of constipation symptoms in all patients with IBS-C. Other
      treatment options are therefore needed for those patients with chronic
      constipation and IBS-C who fail currently available therapies. This article will 
      present information on the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of linaclotide, a
      new agent designed to treat symptoms of both chronic constipation and IBS-C.
      Preclinical data, clinical studies and safety data will also be reviewed.

AB  - First defined in the mid-1990s, prebiotics, which alter the composition and
      activity of gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota to improve health and well-being,
      have generated scientific and consumer interest and regulatory debate. The Life
      Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the
      Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess
      the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for
      prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A 
      developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk
      and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory
      bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders,
      including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability 
      and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by
      promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the
      relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of
      human health. New information derived from the characterization of the
      composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions
      among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our
      understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist
      in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.

LID - 10.3892/mmr.2012.843 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigated the diet and quality of life of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients in comparison to the background population. Furthermore, 
      it studied the effects of guidance on diet management on changes in food intake, 
      quality of life and symptoms. A total of 35 healthy controls, 36 IBS patients and
      43 IBS patients who had received guidance on diet management 2 years earlier were
      included. The controls and patients were asked to complete an FFQ questionnaire, 
      an SF-NDI questionnaire, an IBS-QoL questionnaire and a Birmingham IBS symptom
      score questionnaire. There were no statistical differences in the intake of
      calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat between the controls and IBS patients, 
      with or without guidance on diet management. IBS patients made a conscious choice
      to avoid certain food items, some of which belong to fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs). They had a
      higher consumption, however, of other food items that are rich in FODMAPs. They
      also avoided other food sources which are crucial for their health. Two years
      after receiving guidance on diet management, IBS patients had a different diet
      profile. They avoided all FODMAPrich food, consumed more food with probiotic
      supplements and did not avoid food sources that were crucial to their health. In 
      addition, they had improved quality of life and reduced symptoms. Although at
      first sight the diet of IBS patients did not differ from that of the background
      population, detailed examination showed avoidance of certain food items. Guidance
      on the management of diet improved their choice of a healthier diet, improved
      quality of life and reduced IBS symptoms.

TI  - The value of eliminating foods according to food-specific immunoglobulin G
      antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea.
PG  - 204-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the role of food intolerance in irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (D-IBS). METHODS: Specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      antibodies against 14 common food antigens in the serum were measured in 77
      patients with D-IBS and 26 healthy controls. Food-specific IgG antibodies were
      identified in 39 (50.65%) patients with D-IBS patients compared with four
      (15.38%) controls. For 12 weeks following the serological testing, 35 patients
      with D-IBS and food intolerance consumed diets that excluded the identified food.
      Changes in the main symptoms of D-IBS were evaluated before treatment and
      regularly during treatment in these patients. RESULTS: After 4 weeks' dietary
      therapy, most symptoms of D-IBS had improved. By 12 weeks, all symptom scores had
      decreased significantly compared with the baseline scores. CONCLUSIONS: The
      12-week specific-food exclusion diets resulted in significant improvements in
      abdominal pain (bloating level and frequency), diarrhoea frequency, abdominal
      distension, stool shape, general feelings of distress and total symptom score
      compared with baseline in patients with D-IBS.

      words.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-10-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      are chronic conditions affecting millions of individuals in the United States.
      The symptoms are well-documented and can be debilitating. How these chronic
      gastrointestinal (GI) conditions impact the daily lives of those afflicted is not
      well documented, especially from a patient's perspective. METHODS: Here we
      describe data from a series of 22 focus groups held at three different academic
      medical centers with individuals suffering from chronic GI conditions. All focus 
      groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Two research team members
      independently analyzed transcripts from each focus group following an agreed upon
      coding scheme. RESULTS: One-hundred-thirty-six individuals participated in our
      study, all with a chronic GI related condition. They candidly discussed three
      broad themes that characterize their daily lives: identification of disease and
      personal identity, medications and therapeutics, and daily adaptations. These all
      tie to our participants trying to deal with symptoms on a daily basis. We find
      that a recurrent topic underlying these themes is the dichotomy of experiencing
      uncertainty and striving for control. CONCLUSIONS: Study participants' open
      dialogue and exchange of experiences living with a chronic GI condition provide
      insight into how these conditions shape day-to-day activities. Our findings
      provide fertile ground for discussions about how clinicians might best
      facilitate, acknowledge, and elicit patients' stories in routine care to better
      address their experience of illness.

      (Review).
PG  - 723-31
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2012.926 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) believe that diet plays a
      significant role in inducing IBS symptoms and desire to know what foods to avoid.
      It has been found that the intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat by
      IBS patients does not differ from that of the background population. IBS patients
      were found to avoid certain food items that are rich in fermentable oligo-, di-
      and monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs), but they did have a high consumption of
      many other FODMAP-rich food items. The diet of IBS patients was found to consist 
      of a low calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin B2 and vitamin A content. There 
      is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy, nor is
      there documented evidence that food intolerance plays a role in IBS symptoms.
      Abnormalities in gut hormones have been reported in IBS patients. As gut hormones
      control and regulate gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this may explain
      the abnormal gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity reported in 
      these patients. Guidance concerning food management which includes individually
      based restrictions of FODMAP-rich food items and individual evaluation of the
      effects of protein-, fat- and carbohydrate-rich/poor diets may reduce IBS
      symptoms.

TI  - Alternative procedure to shorten rectal barostat procedure for the assessment of 
      rectal compliance and visceral perception: a feasibility study.
PG  - 896-903
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0543-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Barostat methodology is widely used for assessing visceral
      perception. Different barostat protocols are described with respect to the
      measurement of rectal compliance and visceral perception. The choice of protocols
      affects the duration, which is normally 60-90 min, and accuracy of the procedure.
      This study aimed to shorten the procedure by using the semi-random distension
      protocol for both compliance and visceral perception measurement and a correction
      based on rectal capacity (RC) instead of minimal distension pressure (MDP).
      METHODS: Twelve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (7 females) and 11
      healthy controls (8 females) underwent a barostat procedure. Compliance was
      determined during both a staircase distension and a semi-random protocol.
      Visceral perception data were compared as a function of pressure or relative
      volume, corrected for MDP or RC, respectively. RESULTS: Compliance measurement
      using the semi-random protocol instead of the staircase distension protocol
      resulted in an overestimation in healthy volunteers, but not in IBS patients. The
      overall conclusion that IBS patients had a lower compliance compared to controls 
      was not different between protocols. Data presentation of the visceral perception
      scores as a function of corrected volume instead of pressures corrected for MDP
      did not alter the conclusion that sensation scores in IBS patients were higher as
      compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that barostat
      procedures may be shortened by approximately 20 min, without losing the ability
      to discriminate between healthy controls and IBS patients. A correction for RC
      instead of MDP may improve the accuracy of the procedure.

TI  - The shortcomings of clinical trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 112-9
LID - 10.1089/acm.2011.0015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical trials within the past decade have aimed to study
      the safety and efficacy of various probiotic strains in treating patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there exists much heterogenicity in
      study design among these trials, namely, in bacterial strain, dose, dosage form, 
      sample size, study duration, and population demographics. AIM: The aim of this
      study was to identify the shortcomings of clinical trials using probiotic
      treatments in subjects with IBS, so that researchers may realize where
      limitations exist, allowing them to curtail these limitations in future trials.
      METHODS: An extensive PubMed search was conducted using the following keywords:
      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, probiotic pharmacokinetics,
      Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Alosetron, Tegaserod, Alosetron, and Tegaserod
      safety profile. A total of 62 articles were used in constructing this review,
      with 20 original articles. RESULTS: Stark differences in study design existed
      among the 20 original articles analyzed, as well as an outstandingly high
      "placebo effect," making the ability to compare these articles as a means for
      evidence-based treatment therapy in IBS very difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Future
      large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials must be
      conducted, embodying minimal variability in study designs, to appropriately
      assess the efficacy of specific probiotic strains over placebo.

TI  - Stress and the gut: pathophysiology, clinical consequences, diagnostic approach
      and treatment options.
PG  - 591-9
AB  - Stress, which is defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, shows both short- and
      long-term effects on the functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to
      stress results in alterations of the brain-gut interactions ("brain-gut axis")
      ultimately leading to the development of a broad array of gastrointestinal
      disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal diseases, food antigen-related
      adverse responses, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The
      major effects of stress on gut physiology include: 1) alterations in
      gastrointestinal motility; 2) increase in visceral perception; 3) changes in
      gastrointestinal secretion; 4) increase in intestinal permeability; 5) negative
      effects on regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal mucosa and mucosal blood
      flow; and 6) negative effects on intestinal microbiota. Mast cells (MC) are
      important effectors of brain-gut axis that translate the stress signals into the 
      release of a wide range of neurotransmitters and proinflammatory cytokines, which
      may profoundly affect the gastrointestinal physiology. IBS represents the most
      important gastrointestinal disorder in humans, and is characterized by chronic or
      recurrent pain associated with altered bowel motility. The diagnostic testing for
      IBS patients include routine blood tests, stool tests, celiac disease serology,
      abdominal sonography, breath testing to rule out carbohydrate (lactose, fructose,
      etc.) intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is
      recommended if alarming symptoms are present or to obtain colonic biopsies
      especially in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. The management of IBS is
      based on a multifactorial approach and includes pharmacotherapy targeted against 
      the predominant symptom, behavioural and psychological treatment, dietary
      alterations, education, reassurance and effective patient-physician relationship.
      When evaluating for the stress-induced condition in the upper GI tract, the
      diagnostic testing includes mainly blood tests and gastroscopy to rule out GERD
      and peptic ulcer disease. The therapy for these conditions is mainly based on the
      inhibition of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors and eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori-infection. Additionally, melatonin an important mediator of
      brain gut axis has been shown to exhibit important protective effects against
      stress-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, probiotics may
      profoundly affect the brain-gut interactions ("microbiome-gut-brain axis") and
      attenuate the development of stress-induced disorders in both the upper and lower
      gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on the brain-gut axis are needed to open 
      new therapeutic avenues in the future.

LID - 0410 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) varies depending
      on the criteria used to diagnose it, but it ranges from about 5% to 20%. IBS is
      associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor function and enhanced visceral
      perception, as well as psychosocial and genetic factors. People with IBS often
      have other bodily and psychiatric symptoms, and have an increased likelihood of
      having unnecessary surgery compared with people without IBS. METHODS AND
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following
      clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with IBS? We
      searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up
      to August 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check 
      our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms
      alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
      RESULTS: We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met 
      our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of
      evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present
      information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following
      interventions: 5HT(3) receptor antagonists (alosetron and ramosetron), 5HT(4)
      receptor agonists (tegaserod), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), antispasmodics (including
      peppermint oil), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy, loperamide,
      and soluble and insoluble fibre supplementation.

PG  - 403-13

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a poorly understood, yet highly
      prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). The withdrawal, due to
      adverse events, of a number of pharmacological agents that were approved for the 
      treatment of IBS has left a therapeutic vacuum for patients suffering from the
      disorder. AIM: To review, summarise and critically evaluate current knowledge of 
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used to treat IBS. METHODS: We assessed a
      comprehensive range of relevant literature from Pubmed, Medline and online
      sources based on our definition of LAB which included both typical and atypical
      species, covering Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, Enterococci, Streptococci and
      Bacilli. RESULTS: Of the 42 trials evaluated examining the efficacy of LAB in
      IBS, 34 reported beneficial effects in at least one of the endpoints or symptoms 
      examined, albeit with tremendous variation in both the magnitude of effect and
      the choice of outcome under consideration. However, numerous concerns have been
      expressed over deficits of trial design and execution relating to strain
      selection, optimum dosage, mode of action, safety and long-term tolerability in a
      disorder that can persist throughout the lifetime of affected individuals.
      CONCLUSIONS: Progress in the field will require an improved understanding of how 
      the microbiota impacts on health and disease, adequately powered long-term
      multicentre trials and the embracing of bench to bedside approaches. Recent
      incremental advances suggest these areas are being addressed and that the future 
      holds much promise for the use of lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome.

LID - 10.1159/000332987 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the intensity of symptoms of
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or the consequences of the disease on patients' 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This observational investigation assessed
      the symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, number of stools per day, and stool
      consistency), impact on HRQOL, and consequence on anal continence in 297 patients
      with IBS-D before and after 1 month of probiotic treatment with Lacteol
      (inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium). METHODS: Functional
      assessment using a standardized visual analogue scale in order to quantify
      abdominal pain, bloating, and quality of life before and after 1 month of
      treatment with 2 capsules/day of Lacteol. The number of symptomatic days per
      week, number of stools, consistency of stools, secondary fecal incontinence rate,
      and potential trigger effect of food were quantified. A chi2 test was used to
      compare qualitative data and the variance of quantitative criteria was analyzed. 
      RESULTS: The pain score decreased from 4.46+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 before
      treatment to 2.8+/-0.14 after treatment (p<0.0001). Bloating decreased from
      4.49+/-0.18 to 2.5+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 (p<0.0001). The HRQOL score, which
      is inversely correlated with quality of life, decreased from 5.99+/-0.14 to
      3.92+/-0.16 (p<0.0001). In this cohort study, the fecal incontinence rate
      secondary to diarrhea was clearly higher than that of the general population: 18%
      versus a prevalence of 9-10%, according to different studies. The mean number of 
      stools per week decreased from 17.59 to 12.83 after treatment (p<0.0001). Before 
      treatment, 54% of patients had watery stools and 46% had smooth stools; at the
      end of treatment, only 18.5% of patients still had watery stools, and 34% had
      normal stools. 52% of patients attributed their symptoms to their diet: 34% to
      vegetables, 29% to fruit, 15% to milk, 15% to fat, 6% to peppers and spices, and 
      4% to sugar. CONCLUSION: This observational investigation shed new light on
      patients with IBS-D, the HRQOL of which is altered by a fecal incontinence rate
      twice as high as that of the general population. Correlation with diet is
      confirmed by 1 out of 2 patients reporting poor tolerance of fiber and dairy
      products. Nutritional management should thus be part of these patients'
      treatment. Inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium is a
      probiotic drug that has been used by physicians for a long time to treat patients
      with diarrhea. Strongly concentrated, it has no side effects and seems to help
      these patients. Due to a strong placebo effect in patients with this pathology,
      however, a controlled study is necessary to confirm this result.

AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are present in foods or dietary
      supplements and that confer health benefits to the host when ingested in
      sufficient quantities. Probiotics can be bacterial (e.g. Bifidobacteria spp. and 
      Lactobacillus spp.) or yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii). The administration 
      of probiotics is often believed to be by and large beneficial for individuals
      with inflammatory or infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These
      positive effects are generally attributed to the ability of probiotics to
      regulate intestinal permeability, normalize host intestinal flora, improve gut
      immune barrier function, and equilibrate the balance between proinflammatory and 
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, however, these claims are not always
      substantiated by findings from properly conducted clinical trials. Of particular 
      importance, even when results from randomized controlled trials support the
      beneficial effects of a particular probiotic for a specific indication, the
      benefits achieved by the probiotic are generally not translatable to other
      probiotic formulations. This review discusses the gastrointestinal indications
      for probiotic use and describes the level of evidence that supports the use of
      specific probiotics for these indications. Several indications are addressed,
      including enteric infections, gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, 
      necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

AB  - The gut flora carries out important functions for human health, although most of 
      them are still unknown, and an alteration of any of them, due to a condition of
      dysbiosis, can lead to relevant pathological implications. Commensal bacteria in 
      the gut are essential for the preservation of the integrity of the mucosal
      barrier function and an alteration in the anatomic functional integrity of this
      barrier has been implicated in the pathophysiologic process of different
      diseases. The gut microflora plays a role in modulating the intestinal immune
      system; in fact, it is essential for the maturation of gut-associated lymphatic
      tissue, the secretion of IgA and the production of antimicrobial peptides. The
      enteric flora represents a potent bioreactor which controls several metabolic
      functions, even if most of them are still unknown. The main metabolic functions
      are represented by the fermentation of indigestible food substances into simple
      sugars, absorbable nutrients, and short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the gut
      microbiota exerts important trophic and developmental functions on the intestinal
      mucosa. This overview focuses briefly on the physiological role of the gut
      microbiota in maintaining a healthy state and the potential role played by
      disturbances of both the function and composition of the gut microbiota in
      determining important pathological conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, 
      inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cancer.

TI  - The effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal
      microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 220-7
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31823712b1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      is still controversial. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic
      mixture on IBS symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with 
      diarrhea-dominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Fifty patients with D-IBS were randomized
      into placebo or probiotic mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus
      plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium
      lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 CFU)
      groups. Treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was adequate
      relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. A
      responder was defined as a patient who experienced AR for at least half of the
      10-week study period. Secondary outcomes included the effects on individual
      symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS quality of life. The fecal flora compositions
      were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The proportion of AR was consistently higher in 
      the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period
      (P<0.05). The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics
      group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, P=0.01). Stool consistency improved
      significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. Percent
      changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but IBS
      quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group.
      Comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora
      showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after 
      treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo
      group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic mixture was
      effective in providing AR of overall IBS symptoms and improvement of stool
      consistency in D-IBS patients, although it had no significant effect on
      individual symptoms. The therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the 
      stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the therapeutic effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle
      1917 (EcN) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and identify subgroups benefiting
      most. BACKGROUND: Some trials investigating therapeutic effects in irritable
      bowel syndrome have shown benefits in IBS subgroups only. Probiotic treatment
      seems to be promising. METHODS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (120; Rome
      II) were recruited to a prospective double-blind study and randomized to either
      EcN (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60) given for 12 weeks. Objectives were to describe 
      efficacy and safety of EcN in different groups of irritable bowel syndrome.
      Outcome was assessed by 'Integrative Medicine Patient Satisfaction Scale'.
      RESULTS: Altogether, the responder rate was higher in the EcN than in the placebo
      group. However, only after 10 and 11 weeks, the differences were significant
      (Delta 20.0% points [95% CI 2.6; 37.4], p = 0.01 and Delta 18.3% points [95% CI
      1.0; 35.7], p = 0.02, respectively). The best response was observed in the
      subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel
      syndrome onset (Delta 45.7% points, p = 0.029). No significant differences were
      observed in any other subgroup. Both treatment groups showed similar adverse
      events and tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic EcN shows effects in irritable bowel
      syndrome, especially in patients with altered enteric microflora, e.g. after
      gastroenterocolitis or administration of antibiotics.

AB  - The synbiotic concept was first introduced, along with prebiotics, as "mixtures
      of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the
      survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the
      gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by
      activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting
      bacteria, thus improving host welfare" (Gibson & Roberfroid 1995). Since, there
      have been many in vitro and in vivo studies focusing on the application of
      prebiotics, firstly in health and gradually in disease states. Only recently have
      studies on synbiotics started to emerge with the main focus being on applications
      against disease. Here, we review the current literature, with the main focus on
      in vivo human studies.

      disorders in adults.
PG  - 195-200
LID - 10.1177/0884533611423926 [doi]
AB  - For decades, if not centuries, a variety of products with what would now be
      regarded as prebiotic and probiotic properties have been consumed by the general 
      public and advocated for their benefits on health and, in particular,
      gastrointestinal well-being. More recently, medical science has taken a great
      interest in the population of micro-organisms, the gut microbiota that normally
      populates the human gut, and the range of important functions carried out by the 
      microbiota in health is being progressively defined. As a corollary, the list of 
      disorders and diseases that may result from disruption of the normal microbiota
      and/or its interaction with the host continues to grow. A scientific basis for
      the use of probiotics and prebiotics is, therefore, beginning to emerge.
      Unfortunately, although progress has been made, the clinical evidence to support 
      the use of these preparations lags behind. Nevertheless, a number of human
      disease states may benefit from the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal
      illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases, certain infectious disorders, and
      irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria, and
      although a variety of health benefits have been attributed to their use,
      prebiotics have been subjected to few large-scale clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various
      gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current 
      attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for
      probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing,
      types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and
      clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were
      mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK.
      RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said 
      they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients,
      including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The
      most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing
      yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more
      popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were
      irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of
      prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants 
      had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their
      routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is
      necessary.

TI  - Probiotics--an alternative treatment for various diseases.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - Modulating the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract through probiotics is an 
      alternative to the conventional treatment of various diseases, based on synthetic
      drugs. The lifestyle, nutrition and stress of the present modern society could be
      among the factors responsible for modifications in the intestinal microbiota,
      correlated with specific diseases. The present study describes the positive
      effects of probiotics use, with special reference to the yeasts use in several
      frequently encountered diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia, the irritable
      bowel syndrome, gastritis and several uro-genital disorders.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: the role of the intestinal microbiota, pathogenesis and
      therapeutic targets.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that
      predominantly affects women and accounts for up to 40% of the gastroenterology
      unit outpatient visits. The pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. In the
      present review we will focus on the role of intestinal dysbiosis in its
      pathogenesis and treatment. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) can put light on the
      mechanisms underlying IBS. Modified commensal gut flora may lead to mucosal
      inflammation. Several changes such as an increase in mucosal cellularity
      (enterochromaffin cells, lamina propria T lymphocytes and mast cells), modified
      pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and disordered
      neurotransmission have been observed. The normal microbiota is an essential
      factor in health. A modification of the flora, such as small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) is thought to play a pathogenic role in IBS. Changes in the
      composition of the luminal and mucosal colonic flora have been linked to IBS. It 
      is not clear however, whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of the
      syndrome. The comprehension of the interaction between the dysbiotic microbiota
      and the host will probably lead to the development of focused therapies. Based on
      these assumptions, treatments modulating the microbiota have been investigated.
      On the one hand several probiotics have shown a reduction in IBS symptoms by an
      immunomodulatory and analgesic effects. On the other hand antibiotic treatment
      has proven efficacy in treating IBS with or without associated SIBO. Due to its
      complex pathophysiology, treating IBS nowadays implies multiple approaches, one
      of which may be modulation of the intestinal flora.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy of fibromyalgia.
PG  - 285-97
LID - 10.1016/j.berh.2011.01.015 [doi]
AB  - There have been substantial advances in the pharmacotherapy of fibromyalgia (FM),
      which have occurred in parallel with advances in our understanding of the
      pathophysiology of FM in the past several years. Consortia of researchers have
      established a core set of symptom domains, which constitute the condition of FM, 
      including pain, fatigue, sleep and mood disturbance and cognitive dysfunction,
      which significantly impact a patient's overall well-being and ability to
      function. Outcome measures, which assess these domains, both singly and in
      composite format, are showing increasing reliability to discriminate between the 
      treatment and placebo arms in clinical trials of emerging therapies, which are
      targeting the pathophysiologic mechanisms of FM. Several different medications,
      including the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, duloxetine and
      milnacipran, and the alpha(2)delta modulator, pregabalin, have been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of FM, based on their
      clinically meaningful and durable effect on pain in monotherapy trials. They also
      have been shown to beneficially effect patient global impression of change,
      function and variably other key symptom domains, such as fatigue, sleep
      disturbance and cognition. Other medicines, although they have not gone through
      the formal approval process, have also shown efficacy in multiple domains of FM. 
      Although combination trials have generally not yet been performed, the combined
      use of medicines with complementary mechanisms of action is rational, and, when
      done with appropriate caution, will likely be shown to be safe and well
      tolerated. Adjunctive therapy with medicines targeted at specific symptom
      domains, such as sleep, as well as treatments aimed at common co-morbid
      conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, or disease states, such as
      rheumatoid arthritis, should be considered for the purpose of reducing the
      patient's overall symptom burden. Current therapies neither completely treat FM
      symptoms nor benefit all patients; thus, further research on new therapies with
      different mechanisms and side-effect profiles is needed.

AB  - Colonic motor abnormalities are implicated in several gastrointestinal disorders 
      including constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and functional diarrhoea.
      Defining the colonic abnormalities is difficult and several novel techniques
      including, high-resolution fibre optic manometry, wireless motility capsules,
      ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have emerged to help in the diagnosis
      of these conditions. Coupled with the developing techniques are the novel
      treatments that look to restore normal colonic motility. These treatments include
      pharmacological agents (pharmabiotics, serotonin agonist, secretagogues) and
      medical devices (sacral nerve stimulation, transcutaneous electrical stimulation 
      and biofeedback). This review summarizes the novel techniques used to record and 
      define colonic motor abnormalities and the current status of the emerging
      treatments used to treat them.

PG  - 664-71
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31823c9b88 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present qualitative study was to develop the
      items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for pediatric patients with
      functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and organic GI diseases, hereafter
      referred to as GI disorders. METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase
      qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to
      generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with
      extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding
      the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 
      5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis],
      gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and
      cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing
      protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods
      involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content
      saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items
      measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines,
      and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients 
      and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for
      the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next
      iterative phase.

AB  - Thanks to rapid progress in the development and application of molecular
      techniques to the assessment of the human gut microbiome, the true nature,
      diversity and metabolic potential of this 'hidden organ' are being revealed.
      Simultaneously, the complex physiological, immunological and metabolic
      interactions between host and microbiome are being untangled. By contrast, the
      probiotic concept has been with us for decades and, while supported more by fad
      and folklore in the past, is now gaining support, not only from experimental work
      in animal models, but also by well-designed studies in human diseases, most
      notably infectious diarrheas, inflammatory bowel disease and the irritable bowel 
      syndrome.

PG  - S168-71
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318230928b [doi]
AB  - This study describes the consensus opinion of the participants of the third Yale 
      Workshop on probiotic use. There were 10 experts participating. The
      recommendations update those of the first 2 meetings that were published in 2005 
      and 2008. The workshop presentations and papers in this supplement relate to the 
      involvement of normal microbiota involved in intestinal microecology, how the
      microbes interact with the intestine to affect our immunologic responses, the
      stability and natural history of probiotic organisms, and the role of the
      intestinal microbatome with regard to affecting cardiac risk factors and obesity.
      Recommendations for the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis, childhood
      diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium
      difficile diarrhea are reviewed. As in previous publications, the recommendations
      are given as A, B, or C ratings. The recent positive experiences with
      bacteriotherapy (fecal microbiome transplant) are also discussed in detail and a 
      positive recommendation is made for use in severe resistant C. difficile
      diarrhea.

AB  - The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unknown. However, 
      several lines of epidemiological, physiological, and clinical data suggest a role
      for intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recent microbiology 
      studies demonstrated differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota 
      between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. In addition, physiological
      studies have shown that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotics,
      prebiotics, or probiotics can affect intestinal functions (eg, motility and
      sensation) relevant in the pathogenesis of IBS. Several randomized control trials
      comparing the effects of probiotics versus placebo in IBS have been published.
      Despite considerable differences in study design, dosing regimens, probiotic
      species used, and reported clinical end points, the current data indicate
      improving IBS symptoms and reducing the risk of persistent IBS symptoms. The data
      on the use of probiotics in children with IBS is more limited but is also
      suggestive for beneficial effects. The inconsistencies between the studies
      underline the need to look at each probiotic product separately for specific
      conditions, symptoms, and patient populations. This review article discusses the 
      rationale for targeting the intestinal microbiota in patient with IBS and
      provides an overview and a critical evaluation of the currently available
      clinical data on the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with IBS.

AB  - The objective of this research was to study the efficacy and safety of capsule
      'UB03' to treat patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Thirty patients
      with Rome II IBS were assigned to receive capsule 'UB03' (10 billion lyophilised 
      bacteria and yeast/capsule produced by Unique Biotech Limited, India) twice daily
      for 90 days. Assessment of IBS was carried out according with Rome II criteria
      and their severity for 90 days of treatment with an interval of 30 days. Complete
      haemogram, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum creatinine were performed
      as a part of safety evaluation at the time of inclusion and after 90 days of
      treatment. There was significant improvement in frequency of defecation (23%),
      consistency of stool, abdominal discomfort, bloating and flatulence. However,
      there was no significant change in abdominal pain and mucus in stool. This trial 
      demonstrates that the consumption of capsule 'UB03' containing potential
      probiotic strains is found to be effective and safe for the treatment of patients
      with IBS.

AB  - Strains of Saccharomyces boulardii, a probiotic yeast, have been found to be
      effective in the treatment of diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable
      bowel syndrome and other conditions. In the present study, Unique 28, a strain of
      S. boulardii isolated and characterised in our laboratory, was evaluated for its 
      safety assessment. Acute and subacute toxicity tests were performed in rats. The 
      dose of Unique 28 (5x10(9) cfu/g) fed orally was, up to 6,500 mg per kg of b.w.
      (body weight) for acute toxicity and up to 1,300 mg per kg of b.w. for sub-acute 
      toxicity studies. This dose was well tolerated and there was no morbidity or any 
      kind of toxic clinical symptoms displayed either in male or female rats.
      Moreover, the results of sub-acute toxicity studies using Unique 28 administered 
      for 14 weeks indicated that there were no clear unwanted treatment related
      effects. Overall results of this toxicology assessment indicate that Unique 28 is
      safe for human consumption.

TI  - BDNF expression in the hippocampus of maternally separated rats: does
      Bifidobacterium breve 6330 alter BDNF levels?
PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.3920/BM2011.0015 [doi]
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is of interest because of its putative
      role in stress and psychiatric disorders. Maternal separation is used as an
      animal model of early-life stress and of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Animals 
      exposed to the paradigm show altered gut function together with heightened levels
      of arousal and corticosterone. Some probiotic organisms have been shown to be of 
      benefit in IBS and influence the brain-gut axis. Our objective was to investigate
      the effects of maternal separation on BDNF under basal conditions and in response
      to the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve 6330. The study implemented the maternal
      separation model which we have previously described. Polymerase chain reaction
      and in situ hybridisation were performed to measure the effect of maternal
      separation on both BDNF total variants and BDNF splice variant (exon) IV in the
      hippocampus. Maternally separated and non-separated rats were treated with B.
      breve 6330, to investigate the effect of this probiotic on BDNF total variant and
      BDNF exon IV expression. Maternal separation increased BDNF total variants
      (P<0.01), whilst having no effect on BDNF exon IV. B. breve 6330 increased BDNF
      total variants (P<0.01), and decreased BDNF splice variant IV, in non-separated
      rats (P<0.01). B. breve 6330 did not alter BDNF levels in the maternally
      separated rats. Maternal separation caused a marked increase in BDNF in the
      hippocampus. While B. breve 6330 influenced BDNF in normal animals, it had no
      significant effect on BDNF in those which were maternally separated. We have
      demonstrated that an orally administered probiotic can influence hippocampal
      BDNF.

PG  - 975-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01775.x [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health issue that is characterized by 
      abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, and altered visceral perception. The
      complexity and variability in symptoms pose serious challenges in treating IBS.
      Current therapy for IBS is primarily focused on reducing the abdominal pain,
      thereby improving the quality of life to a significant extent. Although the use
      of fiber rich diet is widely recommended in treating IBS, some studies have
      questioned its use. Intra-colonic butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is
      primarily produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. In the
      existing literature there are conflicting reports about the function of butyrate.
      In rats it is known to induce visceral hypersensitivity without altered
      pathology, whereas in humans it has been reported to reduce visceral pain.
      Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for this contrasting effect of
      butyrate is important before recommending fiber rich diet to IBS patients.

TI  - Effect of herbal extract granules combined with probiotic mixture on irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhea: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 219
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-12-219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder
      characterized by abdominal pain and change of bowel habits without organic
      disease. Many patients seek alternative IBS treatments because of the limitations
      of conventional treatments. Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS), a herbal formula, has long
      been used for alleviating diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional
      medicine. Duolac7S, which comprises 7 bacterial species as probiotics, has been
      frequently used for D-IBS. Although GJS and Duolac7S have been administered
      simultaneously in many D-IBS patients, no study has investigated the effects of
      GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. METHODS/DESIGN: The current trial 
      is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm study. After a 2-week 
      run-in period, 60 patients with D-IBS will be randomly assigned to one of the 4
      combination groups consisting of GJS (water extract granules, 3 g/pack, 3 times a
      day) with Duolac7S (powder form, 1 capsule, 2 times a day) or their placebos and 
      followed up for 2 weeks. The assigned treatments will last for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcomes are adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort and the
      proportion of responders (on a weekly basis). The secondary outcomes are visual
      analog scale for IBS symptoms (on a daily basis), quality of life (at 0, 8, and
      10 weeks), intestinal permeability, and composition of intestinal microbiota (at 
      0 and 8 weeks). DISCUSSION: The present study is designed to examine the safety
      and efficacy of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. Our study provides
      the clinical evidence of a new therapeutic strategy for D-IBS.

TI  - Enterococci as probiotics and their implications in food safety.
PG  - 125-40
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.08.014 [doi]
AB  - Enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and they are of importance
      in foods due to their involvement in food spoilage and fermentations, as well as 
      their utilisation as probiotics in humans and slaughter animals. However, they
      are also important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and 
      other infections. Some strains are resistant to many antibiotics and possess
      virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, pili and haemolysin. The role of
      enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or
      as probiotics. Studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal
      strains isolated from food showed that some can harbour virulence traits, but it 
      is also thought that virulence is not the result of the presence of specific
      virulence determinants alone, but is rather a more intricate process. Specific
      genetic lineages of hospital-adapted strains have emerged, such as E. faecium
      clonal complex (CC) 17 and E. faecalis CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40, which are high
      risk enterococcal clonal complexes. These are characterised by the presence of
      antibiotic resistance determinants and/or virulence factors, often located on
      pathogenicity islands or plasmids. Mobile genetic elements thus are considered to
      play a major role in the establishment of problematic lineages. Although
      enterococci occur in high numbers in certain types of fermented cheeses and
      sausages, they are not deliberately added as starter cultures. Some E. faecium
      and E. faecalis strains are used as probiotics and are ingested in high numbers, 
      generally in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. Such probiotics are
      administered to treat diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea or irritable
      bowel syndrome, to lower cholesterol levels or to improve host immunity. In
      animals, enterococcal probiotics are mainly used to treat or prevent diarrhoea,
      for immune stimulation or to improve growth. From a food microbiological point of
      view, the safety of the bacteria used as probiotics must be assured, and data on 
      the major strains in use so far indicate that they are safe. The advantage of use
      of probiotics in slaughter animals, from a food microbiological point of view,
      lies in the reduction of zoonotic pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract of
      animals which prevents the transmission of these pathogens via food. The use of
      enterococcal probiotics should, in view of the development of problematic
      lineages and the potential for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract of
      both humans and animals, be carefully monitored, and the advantages of using
      these and new strains should be considered in a well contemplated risk/benefit
      analysis.

      focus on lab testing and CAM therapies.
PG  - 250-62
AB  - A 53-year-old female presented with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis.
      Additional conditions and symptoms included Raynaud syndrome, fatigue, irritable 
      bowel syndrome associated constipation (IBS-C), gastroesophageal reflux (GERD),
      menopausal symptoms, chronic urinary tract and upper respiratory infections, and 
      weight gain. She was taking Arthrotec (a combination of diclofenac and
      misoprostol - for pain and inflammation), Fosamax Plus D (alendronate with
      vitamin D3 - recently prescribed because of low bone density), and Catapres
      (clonidine - for menopausal symptoms). Against the advice of her rheumatologist, 
      she had recently discontinued taking Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine),
      methotrexate, and prednisone due to significant side effects. Lab tests to
      identify underlying imbalances and to direct treatment were ordered. Treatment
      included dietary, nutritional, hormonal, and mind/body support. After one year of
      therapy, the patient experienced improvement with all of her presenting
      conditions and symptoms, which enabled her to discontinue several medications.
      She became versed in identifying and avoiding the environmental triggers of her
      disease, including foods (dairy, wheat, eggs, and soy), molds, and emotional
      stress. Antinuclear antibodies were normalized. She experienced a 7.5-percent
      improvement in left trochanteric bone density - comparable to bisphosphonate
      therapy. Mild improvements were also noted in the spine and bilateral femoral
      neck.

TI  - Clinical value of duodenal biopsies--beyond the diagnosis of coeliac disease.
PG  - 538-44
LID - 10.1016/j.prp.2011.08.001 [doi]
AB  - At upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to investigate unexplained diarrhea and iron 
      deficiency anemia, duodenal biopsies are often taken to exclude a diagnosis of
      coeliac disease. While histology remains the gold standard for this diagnosis,
      recent developments in serological testing may overtake this as a first line test
      and biopsy restricted to confirming the diagnosis. Established coeliac disease on
      biopsy is straightforward, but early lesions may pose a challenge. Newer
      endoscopic procedures such as push-pull enteroscopy (balloon enteroscopy) with
      biopsy allow access to the small bowel beyond the second part of the duodenum.
      Controversy remains as to what constitutes the normal histology of the duodenum, 
      and small bowel. Lymphocytic duodenosis (increased intraepithelial lymphocytes
      with normal villous architecture) in patients with negative coeliac serology can 
      be associated with Helicobacter pylori, drugs, autoimmune and other diseases
      including food allergy. Full thickness small intestinal biopsies can aid in
      investigation of enteric neuropathies in severe dysmotility disorders. Biopsies
      are also taken to investigate malabsorption due to suspected infectious and
      metabolic disorders. Despite highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART),
      immunosuppressed patients may be affected by duodenal pathogens. The histology of
      duodenal mucosa in acid related disorders reflects the damage seen at endoscopy. 
      Although the prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease is decreasing, drugs causing
      ulceration remain an important disease entity. Recent observations in functional 
      bowel disorders suggest that the duodenum may be a key site for pathology. In
      functional dyspepsia, patients with early satiety may have excess eosinophil
      infiltration, and the mast cell is probably a key player in the irritable
      syndrome in the small intestine.

TI  - Combination of allergic factors can worsen diarrheic irritable bowel syndrome:
      role of barrier defects and mast cells.
PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.315 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence suggests a role for increased colonic permeability
      and mucosal mast cell (MC) mediators on symptoms related to the irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Whether allergic factors (AFs) are involved in the
      pathophysiology of IBS is unclear. We addressed the question of the possible
      influence of an allergic background on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We assessed
      paracellular permeability, mucosal MCs counts, and spontaneous release of
      tryptase of colonic biopsy specimens in 34 IBS patients and 15 healthy subjects. 
      The severity of IBS was assessed through self-reported questionnaires. All
      individuals were tested for the presence of AF, including self-perception of
      adverse reaction to food, personal and familial history of atopic disease,
      elevated total or specific immunoglobulin E against food/inhalant antigens, blood
      eosinophilia, and skin tests. RESULTS: IBS patients had significant enhanced
      colonic permeability, higher number of MCs, and spontaneous release of tryptase
      than healthy subjects. The severity of IBS was significantly correlated with
      colonic permeability (r=0.48, P=0.004), MCs counts (r=0.36, P=0.03), and tryptase
      (r=0.48, P=0.01). In 13 IBS patients (38.2%) having at least three AFs, symptoms 
      scores, colonic permeability, MCs counts, and tryptase release by colonic
      biopsies were significantly higher than in those with less than three AFs. IBS
      patients with at least three AFs were more prone to diarrhea or alternating
      symptoms. None AF was found to be predictive of IBS severity. CONCLUSIONS: In IBS
      patients, the presence of an allergic background correlates with a more severe
      disease and diarrhea predominance, possibly by enhancing mucosal MC activation
      and paracellular permeability.

      effects of dietary treatment.
PG  - 17-21
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1279747 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of a
      fructose-restricted diet in otherwise healthy children with abdominal pain and
      pathologic fructose hydrogen breath test. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 75 children
      (aging 3-14 years) with recurrent abdominal pain without gastrointestinal disease
      and fructose malabsorption followed a fructose restricted diet for 4 weeks.
      RESULTS: A median decline of weekly pain frequency from 4 (mean 3.64+1.6) before 
      diet to 1 (mean 1.46+1.4; p<0.001) under fructose restriction was documented. The
      intensity of pain decreased from median 6 (mean 5.83+2.0) before intervention to 
      median 3 (mean 3.4+2.5; p<0.001) with diet. Several additional life
      quality-influencing parameters such as daily stool frequency, nausea, problems to
      fall asleep, missed school days also improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study provides evidence that dietary fructose restriction represents a useful
      approach to address recurrent abdominal symptoms in children with fructose
      malabsorption.

TI  - DNFB-DNS hapten-induced colitis in mice should not be considered a model of
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2087-101
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was
      originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation
      resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC
      experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the
      immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by
      skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS 
      on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge 
      on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were
      evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in
      comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild
      mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days.
      Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory
      response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement 
      of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the
      initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response
      appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral
      response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased
      Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can
      display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for
      the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food
      allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.

TI  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and autism: is this a trigger?
PG  - 977-81
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.08.024 [doi]
AB  - Autism is a heterogeneous group of life-long neurologic problems that begin in
      childhood. Success in efforts to understand and treat autism has been mostly
      elusive. The role of autoimmunity in autism has gained recognition both for
      associated systemic autoimmune disease and the presence of brain autoantibodies
      in autistic children and their family members. There is an acknowledged genetic
      susceptibility to autism--most notably allotypes of complement C4. C4 defects are
      associated with several autoimmune diseases and also confer susceptibility to
      mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes
      an enteric inflammatory disease in ruminant animals (Johne's disease) and is the 
      putative cause of the very similar Crohn's disease in humans. Humans are widely
      exposed to MAP in food and water. MAP has been also linked to ulcerative colitis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune (Type 1)
      diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. Environmental agents
      are thought to trigger autism in the genetically at risk. Molecular mimicry is
      the proposed mechanism by which MAP is thought to trigger autoantibodies.
      Autoantibodies to brain myelin basic protein (MBP) is a common feature of autism.
      This article considers the subset of autoimmunity-related autism patients and
      postulates that MAP, through molecular mimicry to its heat shock protein HSP65,
      triggers autism by stimulating antibodies that cross react with myelin basic
      protein (MBP).

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in the management of irritable bowel syndrome: a review
      of recent clinical trials and systematic reviews.
PG  - 581-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32834b8082 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the
      gastrointestinal tract, about which there has been considerable recent research. 
      The aim of this article is to briefly review the aspects of IBS pathogenesis that
      involve the gastrointestinal microbiota, and then to critically appraise the
      recent and emerging evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in its
      management. RECENT FINDINGS: The increased risk of developing IBS following
      gastroenteritis and the co-existence of dysbiosis, elevated luminal gas
      production and immune activation, indicate that the gastrointestinal microbiota
      may be a therapeutic target in IBS. Most systematic reviews indicate that
      probiotics have a beneficial impact on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and
      flatulence. However, recent trials indicate that different probiotics can
      improve, have no effect, or even worsen symptoms, confirming that benefits are
      likely to be strain and symptom-specific. There are no recent clinical trials of 
      prebiotics in IBS, although previous studies indicate potential benefit at lower 
      doses. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the
      management of IBS; however, the benefits are likely to be strain-specific.
      Preliminary studies suggest low doses of prebiotics may improve symptoms of IBS, 
      although further robust clinical trials are required.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that leads
      to crampy pain, gassiness, bloating, and changes in bowel habits in the absence
      of any currently identifiable organic disorder. Patients with IBS may be
      classified by their predominant bowel habit: diarrhea-predominant,
      constipation-predominant, or IBS with alternating bowel movements. IBS is often
      associated with stress or anxiety. Although IBS can be frustrating and concerning
      to patients with this disorder, it does not cause permanent harm to the
      intestines and does not lead to a serious disease such as cancer. Although
      treatments exist for its symptoms, there is no known cure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal
      disorder comprising abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and disordered
      defecation. The prevalence of IBS is 10-15% in the general population. This study
      investigated the prevalence of IBS and the relationship between IBS and stress,
      lifestyle, and dietary habits among nursing and medical school students. METHODS:
      A blank self-administrated questionnaire was used to survey 2,639 students
      studying nursing or medicine. This questionnaire asked about IBS symptoms,
      lifestyle, dietary intake, life events, anxiety, and depression. The
      questionnaires were collected from 2,365 students (89.6%) and the responses of
      1,768 students (74.8%) were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 35.5% as
      a whole, 25.2% in males and 41.5% in females. Significantly higher stress scores 
      (anxiety and depression) and life events were found in the IBS group than in the 
      non-IBS group. Sleep disorders and the time spent sitting were also higher in
      males with IBS. In the IBS group, females ate less fish, fruit, milk, and
      green-yellow vegetables, and more processed food products than the non-IBS group 
      (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.032, p = 0.037, p < 0.001). The rates of missed
      meals and irregular mealtimes were significantly higher in females in the IBS
      group (p = 0.001, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS was higher among
      nursing and medical students, and further interventional studies are needed to
      improve IBS symptoms.

AB  - Whilst facing a worldwide fast increase of food and environmental allergies, the 
      medical community is also confronted with another inhomogeneous group of
      environment-associated disabling conditions, including multiple chemical
      sensitivity (MCS), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, electric
      hypersensitivity, amalgam disease and others. These share the features of
      poly-symptomatic multi-organ cutaneous and systemic manifestations, with
      postulated inherited/acquired impaired metabolism of
      chemical/physical/nutritional xenobiotics, triggering adverse reactions at
      exposure levels far below toxicologically-relevant values, often in the absence
      of clear-cut allergologic and/or immunologic involvement. Due to the lack of
      proven pathogenic mechanisms generating measurable disease biomarkers, these
      environmental hypersensitivities are generally ignored by sanitary and social
      systems, as psychogenic or "medically unexplained symptoms". The uncontrolled
      application of diagnostic and treatment protocols not corresponding to acceptable
      levels of validation, safety, and clinical efficacy, to a steadily increasing
      number of patients demanding assistance, occurs in many countries in the absence 
      of evidence-based guidelines. Here we revise available information supporting the
      organic nature of these clinical conditions. Following intense research on gene
      polymorphisms of phase I/II detoxification enzyme genes, so far statistically
      inconclusive, epigenetic and metabolic factors are under investigation, in
      particular free radical/antioxidant homeostasis disturbances. The finding of
      relevant alterations of catalase, glutathione-transferase and peroxidase
      detoxifying activities significantly correlating with clinical manifestations of 
      MCS, has recently registered some progress towards the identification of reliable
      biomarkers of disease onset, progression, and treatment outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      symptoms suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH); their symptoms improve when they
      are placed on elimination diets. No assays identify patients with FH with
      satisfactory levels of sensitivity. We determined the frequency of FH among
      patients with symptoms of IBS and the ability of fecal assays for tryptase,
      eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), or calprotectin to diagnose FH. METHODS: The
      study included 160 patients with IBS, 40 patients with other gastrointestinal
      diseases, and 50 healthy individuals (controls). At the start of the study,
      patients completed a symptom severity questionnaire, fecal samples were assayed, 
      and levels of specific immunoglobulin E were measured. Patients were observed for
      4 weeks, placed on an elimination diet (without cow's milk and derivatives,
      wheat, egg, tomato, and chocolate) for 4 weeks, and kept a diet diary. Those who 
      reported improvements after the elimination diet period were then diagnosed with 
      FH, based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food
      challenge (with cow's milk proteins and then with wheat proteins). RESULTS: Forty
      of the patients with IBS (25%) were found to have FH. Levels of fecal ECP and
      tryptase were significantly higher among patients with IBS and FH than those
      without FH. The ECP assay was the most accurate assay for diagnosis of FH,
      showing 65% sensitivity and 91% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of 
      patients with IBS have FH. These patients had increased levels of fecal ECP and
      tryptase, indicating that they might cause inflammation in patients with IBS.
      Fecal assays for ECP could be used to identify FH in patients with IBS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal
      disorder. The role of pharmacotherapy for IBS is limited and focused mainly on
      symptom control. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to
      evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodics and antidepressants for
      the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: Computer assisted
      structured searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane library, CINAHL and
      PsychInfo were conducted for the years 1966-2009. An updated search in April 2011
      identified 10 studies which will be considered for inclusion in a future update
      of this review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing
      bulking agents, antispasmodics or antidepressants with a placebo treatment in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome aged over 12 years were considered for
      inclusion. Only studies published as full papers were included. Studies were not 
      excluded on the basis of language. The primary outcome had to include improvement
      of abdominal pain, global assessment or symptom score. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data from the selected studies.
      Risk Ratios (RR) and Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) with 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated. A proof of practice analysis was conducted
      including sub-group analyses for different types of bulking agents, spasmolytic
      agents or antidepressant medication. This was followed by a proof of principle
      analysis where only the studies with adequate allocation concealment were
      included. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 56 studies (3725 patients) were included in
      this review. These included 12 studies of bulking agents (621 patients), 29 of
      antispasmodics (2333 patients), and 15 of antidepressants (922 patients). The
      risk of bias was low for most items. However, selection bias is unclear for many 
      of the included studies because the methods used for randomization and allocation
      concealment were not described. No beneficial effect for bulking agents over
      placebo was found for improvement of abdominal pain (4 studies; 186 patients; SMD
      0.03; 95% CI -0.34 to 0.40; P = 0.87), global assessment (11 studies; 565
      patients; RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; P = 0.32) or symptom score (3 studies;
      126 patients SMD -0.00; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.43; P = 1.00). Subgroup analyses for
      insoluble and soluble fibres also showed no statistically significant benefit.
      Separate analysis of the studies with adequate concealment of allocation did not 
      change these results. There was a beneficial effect for antispasmodics over
      placebo for improvement of abdominal pain (58% of antispasmodic patients improved
      compared to 46% of placebo; 13 studies; 1392 patients; RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.12 to
      1.55; P < 0.001; NNT = 7), global assessment (57% of antispasmodic patients
      improved compared to 39% of placebo; 22 studies; 1983 patients; RR 1.49; 95% CI
      1.25 to 1.77; P < 0.0001; NNT = 5) and symptom score (37% of antispasmodic
      patients improved compared to 22% of placebo; 4 studies; 586 patients; RR 1.86;
      95% CI 1.26 to 2.76; P < 0.01; NNT = 3). Subgroup analyses for different types of
      antispasmodics found statistically significant benefits for cimteropium/
      dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. Separate analysis of the
      studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for
      improvement of abdominal pain. There was a beneficial effect for antidepressants 
      over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain (54% of antidepressants patients
      improved compared to 37% of placebo; 8 studies; 517 patients; RR 1.49; 95% CI
      1.05 to 2.12; P = 0.03; NNT = 5), global assessment (59% of antidepressants
      patients improved compared to 39% of placebo; 11 studies; 750 patients; RR 1.57; 
      95% CI 1.23 to 2.00; P < 0.001; NNT = 4) and symptom score (53% of
      antidepressants patients improved compared to 26% of placebo; 3 studies; 159
      patients; RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.99; P = 0.001; NNT = 4). Subgroup analyses
      showed a statistically significant benefit for selective serotonin releasing
      inhibitors (SSRIs) for improvement of global assessment and for tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) for improvement of abdominal pain and symptom score.
      Separate analysis of studies with adequate allocation concealment found a
      significant benefit for improvement of symptom score and global assessment.
      Adverse events were not assessed as an outcome in this review. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that bulking agents are effective for treating 
      IBS. There is evidence that antispasmodics are effective for the treatment of
      IBS. The individual subgroups which are effective include:
      cimetropium/dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. There is
      good evidence that antidepressants are effective for the treatment of IBS. The
      subgroup analyses for SSRIs and TCAs are unequivocal and their effectiveness may 
      depend on the individual patient. Future research should use rigorous methodology
      and valid outcome measures.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the importance of nutrition in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to improve. With increasing evidence
      or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of
      nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment 
      of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel
      syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized
      in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because
      of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against
      new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now
      beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin
      D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory
      effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a
      randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and
      micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of
      all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding
      of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more
      effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like
      immune-suppressants should be explored.

TI  - Postprandial platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations during
      diarrhea and constipation periods of alternatingtype irritable bowel syndrome
      patients.
PG  - 270-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our aim was to measure concentrations of platelet-poor plasma
      5-hydroxytryptamine and to assess any relationship with gastrointestinal
      symptomatology under fasting and fed conditions in alternating-type irritable
      bowel syndrome during both constipation and diarrhea periods separately. Results 
      of the two periods were compared with each other as well as with the results of
      the controls. METHODS: Nine patients with alternating diarrhea and constipation
      symptoms and 9 controls were enrolled. Serial plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine was
      measured for 1 hour under fasting and for 3 hour after a standard carbohydrate
      meal. Patients underwent the same measurements during constipation and diarrhea
      periods separately. Serum 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations were determined by
      high-performance liquid chromatography. Symptomatology was assessed throughout
      the study. RESULTS: Patients exhibited higher concentrations of platelet-poor
      plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine under fed conditions during diarrhea, especially at
      postprandial 30 minutes (p<0.05) compared with concentrations during
      constipation. Increases in postprandial plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations
      relative to fasting concentrations were also significantly higher during the
      diarrhea period than during constipation and in controls (p<0.05). Although there
      was no significant correlation between plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations 
      and symptom scores, patients had worse postprandial symptomatology during
      diarrhea compared with controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-poor plasma
      5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations after meal ingestion differ between
      constipation and diarrhea periods in alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome.
      Postprandial symptomatology is also more prominent during diarrhea. These results
      suggest that differences in plasma levels of serotonin between diarrhea and
      constipation may underlie the pathogenesis of alternating-type irritable bowel
      syndrome and could be involved in some aspects of symptomatology.

TI  - Role of Saccharomyces boulardii in diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - Several studies with probiotics have shown promising results in the treatment of 
      IBS. One of the probiotics used was saccharomyces boulardii. This is a randomized
      double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of S. boulardii in diarrhoea
      predominant IBS and was carried out in the hospital of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib
      Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from June 2004 to July 2005. Thirty
      five (35) patients were included in each of the control and study groups. The
      study group was treated with S. boulardii 250 mg twice daily orally for one
      month. Patients were evaluated before therapy, at the end of therapy and 30 days 
      after end of therapy by a scoring system which included symptoms as well as
      personal and professional life. No significant difference between the two groups 
      was found in any of the parameters evaluated on any of the observation days. S.
      boulardii treatment for 30 days in diarrhoea predominant IBS patients did not
      result in any improvement in this study.

PG  - 4-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1834-4 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome complain of a sensation of an
      increase in pressure within their abdomen during the course of the day which is
      called bloating and, in approximately half of these individuals, this symptom is 
      accompanied by an actual increase in abdominal girth, which is referred to as
      distension. The pathophysiology of these two phenomena is somewhat different and 
      it is now recognised that a whole variety of overlapping mechanisms are involved.
      Some of these are potentially amenable to treatment by modification of the
      bacterial flora of the gut and this article reviews the evidence for this.

TI  - [Food intolerance: reliability and characteristics of different diagnostic
      alternative tests].
PG  - 1-10
AB  - The expression "food intolerance" dates back to the ancient Greece and can be
      generally defined as a sum of unpleasant symptoms of varying etiology that can
      onset in some patients after the ingestion of various food products. Adverse
      reactions to food can be divided into toxic and non-toxic. The last ones are
      classified as immunologically mediated, called "allergies", and
      non-immunologically mediated, commonly defined as "intolerances". The gut wall is
      directly involved in these adverse reactions to some foods, since it plays a key 
      role in food absorption and in the regulation of the immunitary system. In this
      paper we discuss food intolerances and allergies, evaluating the available
      diagnostic methods and their scientific reliability and focusing on IgG analysis 
      based immunoenzymatic test which is the most relevant test for intolerance
      diagnosis.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption and intolerance: effects of fructose with and without
      simultaneous glucose ingestion.
PG  - 583-92
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2011.566646 [doi]
AB  - Concern exists that increasing fructose consumption, particularly in the form of 
      high-fructose corn syrup, is resulting in increasing rates of fructose
      intolerance and aggravation of clinical symptoms in individuals with irritable
      bowel syndrome. Most clinical trials designed to test this hypothesis have used
      pure fructose, a form not commonly found in the food supply, often in quantities 
      and concentrations that exceed typical fructose intake levels. In addition, the
      amount of fructose provided in tests for malabsorption, which is thought to be a 
      key cause of intolerance, often exceeds the normal physiological absorption
      capacity for this sugar. To help health professionals accurately identify and
      treat this condition, this article reviews clinical data related to understanding
      fructose malabsorption and intolerance (i.e., malabsorption that manifests with
      symptoms) relative to usual fructose and other carbohydrate intake. Because
      simultaneous consumption of glucose attenuates fructose malabsorption,
      information on the fructose and glucose content of foods, beverages, and
      ingredients representing a variety of food categories is provided.

TI  - Epidemiology and symptom profile of gastroesophageal reflux in the Indian
      population: report of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology Task Force.
PG  - 118-27
LID - 10.1007/s12664-011-0112-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications are
      thought to be infrequent in India; there are no data from India on the prevalence
      of and risk factors for GERD. The Indian Society of Gastroenterology formed a
      task force aiming to study: (a) the frequency and profile of GERD in India, (b)
      factors including diet associated with GERD. METHODS: In this prospective,
      multi-center (12 centers) study, data were obtained using a questionnaire from
      3224 subjects regarding the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn,
      regurgitation and other symptoms of GERD. Data were also obtained regarding their
      dietary habits, addictions, and lifestyle, and whether any of these were related 
      or had been altered because of symptoms. Data were analyzed using univariate and 
      multivariate methods. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-five (7.6%) of 3224 subjects
      had heartburn and/or regurgitation at least once a week. On univariate analysis, 
      older age (OR 1.012; 95% CI 1.003-1.021), consumption of non-vegetarian and fried
      foods, aerated drinks, tea/coffee were associated with GERD. Frequency of smoking
      was similar among subjects with or without GERD. Body mass index (BMI) was
      similar in subjects with and without GERD. On multivariate analysis, consumption 
      of non-vegetarian food was independently associated with GERD symptoms. Overlap
      with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was not uncommon; 21% reported
      difficulty in passage of stool and 9% had mucus in stools. About 25% of patients 
      had consulted a doctor previously for their gastrointestinal symptoms.
      CONCLUSION: 7.6% of Indian subjects have significant GERD symptoms. Consumption
      of non-vegetarian foods was an independent predictor of GERD. BMI was comparable 
      among subjects with or without GERD.

TI  - Prevalence and associated factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders and
      bowel habits in Chinese adolescents: a school-based study.
PG  - 168-73
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182125388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we explored the prevalence rates and
      association factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders and the most common 
      modes and frequencies of bowel habit among a cohort of Chinese adolescents.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A stratified, randomized study based on cross-sectional
      data was performed using cluster sampling, which recruited 3671 students in
      Shanghai, China. All of the students were requested to complete a questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 88.05% +/- 0.28% of students had a bowel movement frequency of 
      between 1 of 2 times per day and once every 2 days. Female students were found to
      have a lower bowel frequency than boys (P < 0.01). The prevalence of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation, and functional diarrhea were
      19.89%, 24.93%, and 5.42%, respectively. Certain factors adjusted for age and sex
      were significantly associated with IBS (P < 0.05), including gastrointestinal
      tract infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.26), abuse of analgesics (OR 1.25), air
      swallowing to terminate hiccups (OR 1.28), fatigue (OR 1.15), and depression (OR 
      1.36). Other factors that were adjusted for age and sex, such as fried food (OR
      1.68), air swallowing to terminate hiccups (OR 1.21), anxiety (OR 1.12), and
      depression (OR 1.57), were significantly associated with the presence of
      functional constipation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: : Our findings suggest that
      normal bowel frequency among Chinese urban adolescents may be defined as between 
      1 or 2 bowel movements per day and once every 2 days. IBS, functional
      constipation, and diarrhea are common disorders among this adolescent group.

TI  - Clinical applications of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders in children.
PG  - 153-60
AB  - Probiotics are widely used in promoting human health and adjunctive therapy of
      human disease. Many clinical trials and research studies have shown benefits of
      probiotics. We review the literature associated with the clinical applications of
      probiotics in paediatric diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis, infantile
      colic, infectious diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection, antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhoea, constipation, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease,
      irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain. We also summarize the
      representative probiotics that are commonly used in paediatric diseases.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in prevention and treatment of diseases in infants and 
      children.
PG  - 292-300
LID - 10.2223/JPED.2103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of probiotics and prebiotics on the health of
      children. SOURCES: MEDLINE and LILACS were searched for relevant English and
      French-language articles. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Human milk is rich in
      prebiotic oligosaccharides and may contain some probiotics. No data suggest that 
      addition of probiotics to infant formula may be harmful, but evidence of its
      efficacy is insufficient for its recommendation. Since data suggest that addition
      of specific prebiotic oligosaccharides may reduce infections and atopy in healthy
      infants, their addition to infant formula seems reasonable. Long-term health
      benefits of pro- and prebiotics on the developing immune system remain to be
      proven. Selected probiotics reduce the duration of infectious diarrhea by 1 day, 
      but evidence in prevention is lacking, except in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. 
      Some specific probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, and other
      microorganisms may be beneficial in Helicobacter pylori gastritis and in
      infantile colic. Evidence is insufficient to recommend probiotics in prevention
      and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The use of probiotics in constipation,
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and extra-intestinal
      infections requires more studies. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of administration,
      microbial dosage, and species used need further validation for both pro- and
      prebiotics. Unjustified health claims are a major threat for the pro- and
      prebiotic concept.

TI  - Metabolomics of fecal extracts detects altered metabolic activity of gut
      microbiota in ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 4208-18
LID - 10.1021/pr2003598 [doi]
AB  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy of aqueous fecal extracts has been used to investigate
      differences in metabolic activity of gut microbiota in patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (n = 13), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (n = 10), and healthy
      controls (C) (n = 22). Up to four samples per individual were collected over 2
      years giving a total of 124 samples. Multivariate discriminant analysis, based on
      NMR data from all three groups, was able to predict UC and C group membership
      with good sensitivity and specificity; classification of IBS samples was less
      successful and could not be used for diagnosis. Trends were detected toward
      increased taurine and cadaverine levels in UC with increased bile acid and
      decreased branched chain fatty acids in IBS relative to controls; changes in
      short chain fatty acids and amino acids were not significant. Previous
      PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the same fecal
      material had shown alterations of the gut microbiota when comparing UC and IBS
      groups with controls. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that DGGE profiles
      from the same individual were stable over time, but NMR spectra were more
      variable; canonical correlation analysis of NMR and DGGE data partly separated
      the three groups and revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota profile
      and metabolite composition.

TI  - Rifaximin: new therapeutic indication and future directions.
PG  - 812-27
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.06.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable oral antibiotic that acts locally in the
      gastrointestinal tract with minimal systemic adverse effects. Rifaximin received 
      new labeling for reduction in the risk of the recurrence of overt hepatic
      encephalopathy (HE) in patients with advanced liver disease in March of 2010.
      OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of rifaximin. The efficacy and safety of rifaximin in reducing
      the risk of the recurrence of overt HE in patients with advanced liver disease,
      the new US Food and Drug Administration-approved indication, is the focus of this
      review. Emerging data on the use of rifaximin in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are also evaluated. METHODS: MEDLINE
      and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1983 to January 31, 2011, were
      searched using the key terms rifaximin, L/105, secondary hepatic encephalopathy, 
      irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile. Ongoing trials were
      identified using the clinicaltrials.gov Web site. Abstracts from the annual
      meetings of the American College of Gastroenterology and Digestive Disease Week
      from 2004 to 2010 and references from relevant articles were reviewed. Only
      trials examining use of rifaximin in secondary prophylaxis of HE were included.
      Studies on the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in the treatment of acute
      episodes of HE have been recently summarized elsewhere and are not reviewed here.
      RESULTS: Literature search identified one trial on rifaximin use in secondary
      prevention of HE, six trials in patients with IBS, and six small studies and case
      reports in patients with CDI. In a trial of 299 patients, use of rifaximin 550 mg
      by mouth twice daily for 6 months for prevention of recurrent HE was associated
      with significantly fewer breakthrough HE episodes compared with placebo
      (rifaximin 22%, placebo 46%; P < 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% CI,
      0.28-0.64). The rifaximin group also had fewer hospitalizations involving HE
      compared with placebo (rifaximin 13.6%, placebo 22.6%; P = 0.01), with a hazard
      ratio of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29-0.87). Rifaximin improved IBS symptom management in
      approximately 9% more patients than placebo in 2 prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1260 patients (in the rifaximin group,
      40.8% patients reported IBS symptom improvement compared with 31.7% in the
      placebo group; P < 0.001). The efficacy of rifaximin has been reported for the
      treatment of refractory or recurrent CDI in small studies, case series, and a
      case report. Optimal dosing, duration, and role of rifaximin for CDI management
      is unclear. In clinical trials of rifaximin for prevention of recurrent HE and
      for nonconstipated IBS, its safety profile was comparable to placebo. In the
      trial of rifaximin for prevention of recurrent HE, the most common adverse events
      occurring in 10% to 15% of patients were ascites, dizziness, fatigue, and
      peripheral edema. Most common adverse effects in IBS trials included abdominal
      pain, diarrhea, bad taste, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection,
      occurring in <10% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin can be an effective option 
      for reduction in the risk of the recurrence of HE in patients with advanced liver
      disease. Studies suggest that rifaximin provides relief of global symptoms of
      diarrhea-predominant IBS and bloating. Use of rifaximin in CDI requires further
      study.

AB  - There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment 
      we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive
      tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol,
      microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including
      obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases 
      of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the
      microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this
      is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The
      luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external
      factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's
      esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and
      colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel 
      diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel
      syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of
      particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are
      immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind
      disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic
      esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition
      mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined,
      providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free
      diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that 
      environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for
      its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in
      all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by
      modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to
      gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading
      ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or
      modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other
      novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that 
      lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the
      immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting 
      tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell
      responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease
      reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune
      response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and
      small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as
      ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much 
      more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and
      their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment
      strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterised by abdominal pain and an erratic 
      bowel habit, which depending on the definition used affects 5-10% of the
      population. As a typical complex disease, it is likely that the condition will
      develop when a genetically susceptible individual is exposed to an appropriate
      environment stimulus. This bio-psycho-social model assumes that there is no one
      cause of IBS, but rather that it is the product of complex interactions between
      host and environment. Host factors include gender, age and psychological
      characteristics, while environmental factors include psychosocial stressors,
      gastrointestinal infections, antibiotics and food.

TI  - How patients view probiotics: findings from a multicenter study of patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318225f545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to 
      improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about
      probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they
      consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and
      expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in
      collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted
      with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns
      Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common
      themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred
      thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August
      2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical
      drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option.
      Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their
      gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics,
      their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering 
      probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many
      unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD
      and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy
      advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to
      pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for
      patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits
      and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about
      their use.

AB  - Perceived food hypersensitivity is a prevalent, but poorly understood condition. 
      In this review article, we summarize narratively recent literature including
      results of our 10 years' interdisciplinary research program dealing with such
      patients. The patients (more than 400) included in our studies were all adults
      referred to a university hospital because of gastrointestinal complaints
      self-attributed to food hypersensitivity. Despite extensive examinations, food
      allergy was seldom diagnosed. The majority of the patients fulfilled the
      diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, most suffered from
      several extra-intestinal health complaints and had considerably impaired quality 
      of life. However, psychological factors could explain only approximately 10% of
      the variance in the patients' symptom severity and 90% of the variance thus
      remained unexplained. Intolerance to low-digestible carbohydrates was a common
      problem and abdominal symptoms were replicated by carbohydrate ingestion. A
      considerable number of patients showed evidence of immune activation by analyses 
      of B-cell activating factor, dendritic cells and "IgE-armed" mast cells. Multiple
      factors such as immune activation, disturbed intestinal fermentation, enteric
      dysmotility, post-infectious changes and "local" allergy in the gut as well as
      psychological disturbances may play a role in the pathophysiology of perceived
      food hypersensitivity. Hence, our results support the view that management of
      these patients should be interdisciplinary.

TI  - Gut clock: implication of circadian rhythms in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 139-50
AB  - Circadian and seasonal rhythms are a fundamental feature of all living organisms 
      and their organelles. Biological rhythms are responsible for daily food intake;
      the period of hunger and satiety is controlled by the central pacemaker, which
      resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and
      communicates with tissues via bidirectional neuronal and humoral pathways. The
      molecular basis for circadian timing in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) involves
      interlocking transcriptional/translational feedback loops which culminate in the 
      rhythmic expression and activity of a set of clock genes and related hormones.
      Interestingly, it has been found that clocks in the GIT are responsible for the
      periodic activity (PA) of its various segments and transit along the GIT; they
      are localized in special interstitial cells, with unstable membrane potentials
      located between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers. The rhythm of slow
      waves is controlled in various segments of the GIT: in the stomach (about 3
      cycles per min), in the duodenum (12 cycle per min), in the jejunum and ileum
      (from 7 to 10 cycles per min), and in the colon (12 cycles per min). The
      migrating motor complex (MMC) starts in the stomach and moves along the gut
      causing peristaltic contractions when the electrical activity spikes are
      superimposed on the slow waves. GIT hormones, such as motilin and ghrelin, are
      involved in the generation of MMCs, while others (gastrin, ghrelin,
      cholecystokinin, serotonin) are involved in the generation of spikes upon the
      slow waves, resulting in peristaltic or segmental contractions in the small
      (duodenum, jejunum ileum) and large bowel (colon). Additionally, melatonin,
      produced by neuro-endocrine cells of the GIT mucosa, plays an important role in
      the internal biological clock, related to food intake (hunger and satiety) and
      the myoelectric rhythm (produced primarily by the pineal gland during the dark
      period of the light-dark cycle). This appears to be an endocrine encoding of the 
      environmental light-dark cycle, conveying photic information which is used by
      organisms for both circadian and seasonal organization. Motor and secretory
      activity, as well as the rhythm of cell proliferation in the GIT and liver, are
      subject to many circadian rhythms, mediated by autonomic cells and some
      enterohormones (gastrin, ghrelin and somatostatin). Disruption of circadian
      physiology, due to sleep disturbance or shift work, may result in various
      gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease. In addition,
      circadian disruption accelerates aging, and promotes tumorigenesis in the liver
      and GIT. Identification of the molecular basis and role of melatonin in the
      regulation of circadian rhythm allows researchers and clinicians to approach
      gastrointestinal diseases from a chronobiological perspective. Clinical studies
      have demonstrated that the administration of melatonin improves symptoms in
      patients with IBS and GERD. Moreover, our own studies indicate that melatonin
      significantly protects gastrointestinal mucosa, and has strong protective effects
      on the liver in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Recently, it 
      has been postulated that disruption of circadian regulation may lead to obesity
      by shifting food intake schedules. Future research should focus on the role of
      clock genes in the pathophysiology of the GIT and liver.

TI  - Management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults: conventional and
      complementary/alternative approaches.
PG  - 134-51
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with a
      range of symptoms that significantly affect quality of life for patients. The
      difficulty of differential diagnosis and its treatment may significantly delay
      initiation of optimal therapy. Hence, persons with IBS often self-treat symptoms 
      with non-prescribed pharmacological regimens and/or complementary and alternative
      medicines (CAM) and by modifying diet and daily activities. In addition, most
      common pharmacological approaches target IBS symptom management rather than
      treatment, and prescribed medications often result in significant side effects.
      The purposes of this review article are to: (1) address current issues related to
      IBS, including symptom presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment options;
      (2) summarize benefits and side effects of currently available pharmacological
      regimens and other symptom management strategies, with an emphasis on commonly
      used CAM therapies and diet modification; and (3) outline recommendations and
      future directions of IBS management based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses,
      and research findings.

TI  - Low intake of vitamin B6 is associated with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
PG  - 356-61
LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2011.04.001 [doi]
AB  - Most subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience an association
      between symptoms and food consumption. Although dietary intake has been the focus
      of previous research, attention to specific nutrients has been rare. We
      hypothesized that there is an association between the severity of IBS symptoms
      and the intake of specific food groups and specific nutrients. In this
      cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the
      Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every
      evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of 
      food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period.
      Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily
      IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B(6) was the only
      component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score.
      The median daily intake of vitamin B(6) was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the
      recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day
      or more, respectively. A high symptom score was associated with low vitamin B(6) 
      intake (adjusted R(2) = 0.583; beta = -4.431; 95% confidence interval, -6.386 to 
      -2.476; P = 0.0002). A significant inverse association between intake of vitamin 
      B(6) and severity of IBS symptoms might have clinical implications.

TI  - [The child with chronic diarrhoea: suggestions for workup].
PG  - 1573-6
AB  - Causes of chronic diarrhoea (CD) are numerous. At the first consultation it is
      possible by simple means to evaluate the child for common causes and screen for
      the more severe ones: infection, food allergy, disaccharide malabsorption,
      general malabsorption (celiac disease and cystic fibrosis), inflammatory bowel
      disease, and functional disorders (toddler's diarrhoea and irritable colon
      syndrome). Second line evaluation should take place in the paediatric ward,
      aiming to confirm suspected, complicated disorders and to explore the possibility
      of the large number of rare causes of CD in the seriously sick child.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel
      syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are
      reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of
      medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of
      lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to
      provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to
      treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom
      endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles 
      published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome',
      'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre',
      'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone',
      'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine',
      hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative
      entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide',
      'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated
      for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for
      explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of
      abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete
      evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are
      reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified
      58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS
      symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies
      suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements,
      lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor
      inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine,
      octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is
      the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various
      pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific
      symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to
      better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult
      syndrome.

AB  - Chronic constipation and IBS-C are two of the most common functional bowel
      disorders encountered by primary care providers and gastroenterologists,
      affecting up to 27% of the population in Western countries [1-4]. The treatment
      of these disorders is often empiric and most current therapies are indicated for 
      episodic constipation. Over time, most patients become refractory to one or more 
      laxatives. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) has been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic-idiopathic constipation [6]. It
      is an oral bicyclic fatty acid that selectively activates type 2 chloride
      channels in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, hence
      stimulating chloride secretion, along with passive secretion of sodium and water,
      inducing peristalsis and laxation, without stimulating gastrointestinal smooth
      muscle. Several trials have shown it to be effective in the treatment of chronic 
      idiopathic constipation, and recently also IBS-C. It has little systemic
      absorption and almost free of any serious adverse effects, however, occasionally 
      can cause nausea. Based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude
      that lubiprostone should be added to the short list of evidence-based
      pharmacotherapies for chronic constipation and IBS-C. Given the overlap between
      chronic constipation and IBS-C, clinicians can consider two strategies when
      deciding on the initial dose of lubiprostone. Based on current product labeling, 
      it is recommended that 8 mug bid be started in patients with IBS-C whereas 24 mug
      bid be used in those with chronic constipation. Thus far, lubiprostone offers a
      novel approach to our therapeutic armamentarium, however, there is a need for
      more drugs with different mechanisms of action, in order to treat constipation
      that is often multifunctional.

PG  - 1302-10

AB  - BACKGROUND: A lack of reliable treatments for abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders prompts interest in new therapies. AIM: To evaluate
      systematically the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children.
      METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, trial registries and
      proceedings of major meetings were searched for randomised controlled trials
      (RCTs) evaluating LGG supplementation in children with abdominal pain-related
      functional gastrointestinal disorders based on the Rome II or Rome III criteria. 
      Risk of bias was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation
      concealment, blinding and follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, LGG
      supplementation was associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment
      responders (defined as no pain or a decrease in pain intensity) in the overall
      population with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (three RCTs, n = 290; risk ratio, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59, number needed to
      treat, NNT 7, 95% CI 4-22) and in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subgroup
      (three RCTs, n = 167; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.27, NNT 4, 95% CI 3-8). However, no 
      difference was found in the rate of treatment responders between children with
      functional abdominal pain or functional dyspepsia who received placebo or LGG.
      The intensity of pain was significantly reduced in the overall study population
      and in the IBS subgroup. The frequency of pain was significantly reduced in the
      IBS subgroup only. CONCLUSION: The use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG moderately
      increases treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, particularly among children with IBS.

AB  - GOALS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of probiotics on adult
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through clinical parameters and H
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics. BACKGROUND: As systematic
      effect of probiotics on inflammatory bowel disease through metabonomics approach 
      has been extensively studied to date, metabonomic characterization of the
      probiotics effect on IBS is also needed for better understanding the effect with 
      respect to host metabolic mechanism. STUDY: Seventy-four IBS patients meeting
      Rome criteria were randomized to receive probiotics and placebo through a
      parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study.
      Probiotic fermented milk and placebo were administered 3 times daily for 8 weeks.
      Improvements of IBS were assessed according to Rome III questionnaires and H NMR 
      metabolic profiling of serum and fecal samples from all participants was used to 
      characterize a significant change in serum and fecal metabolome before and after 
      probiotics. RESULTS: Fecal counts of the Lactobacilli, but not Bifidobacteria
      species, which included in the probiotic milk, were increased significantly in
      feces of IBS patients receiving treatment (P=0.014). NMR data set coupled with
      multivariate statistical analysis identified intrinsically elevated serum levels 
      of glucose (P=0.0265) and tyrosine (P=0.0016) in IBS patients. These levels
      normalized to those of healthy individuals in the probiotic administration group,
      but not the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This metabonomic study suggests that in a
      subset of IBS patients there exists a potential dysregulation in energy
      homeostasis (serum glucose) and liver function (serum tyrosine) that may be
      improved through probiotics supplementation. Moreover, global metabolic profiling
      highlights the potential of metabonomic approach for assessing bowel diseases or 
      symptoms with respect to host metabolic perturbation.

PG  - 1071-86

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal bloating and distension are common symptoms in patients
      with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), however, relatively little is
      known about their treatment. AIM: To review the treatment trials for abdominal
      bloating and distension. METHODS: A literature review in Medline for
      English-language publications through February 2010 of randomised, controlled
      treatment trials in adults. Study quality was assessed according to Jadad's
      score. RESULTS: Of the 89 studies reviewed, 18% evaluated patients with
      functional dyspepsia, 61% with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 10% with chronic
      constipation and 10% with other FGIDs. No studies were conducted in patients
      diagnosed with functional abdominal bloating. The majority of trials investigated
      the efficacy of prokinetics or probiotics, although studies are heterogeneous
      with respect to diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. In general, bloating
      and/or distension were evaluated as secondary endpoints or as individual symptoms
      as part of a composite score rather than as primary endpoints. A greater
      proportion of IBS patients with constipation reported improvement in bloating
      with tegaserod vs. placebo (51% vs. 40%, P<0.0001) and lubiprostone (P<0.001). A 
      greater proportion of nonconstipating IBS patients reported adequate relief of
      bloating with rifaximin vs. placebo (40% vs. 30%, P<0.001). Bloating was
      significantly reduced with the probiotics, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624
      (1x10(8) dose vs. placebo: -0.71 vs. -0.44, P<0.05) and B. animalis (live vs.
      heat-killed: -0.56+/-1.01 vs. -0.31+/-0.87, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Prokinetics,
      lubiprostone, antibiotics and probiotics demonstrate efficacy for the treatment
      of bloating and/or distension in certain FGIDs, but other agents have either not 
      been studied adequately or have shown conflicting results.

TI  - Is the colonic response to food different in IBS in contrast to simple
      constipation or diarrhea without abdominal pain?
PG  - 2947-56
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1700-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonic response to food (CRF) is abnormal in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare CRF in
      patients who complain of abnormal defecation pattern according to the presence or
      absence of abdominal pain. METHODS: One hundred forty-nine patients and 50
      controls were studied: 96 IBS patients (46 IBS-C, 13 IBS-D, 15 IBS-M, and 22
      IBS-U not included), 43 patients with functional constipation (group C) and ten
      with functional diarrhea (group D). Clinical evaluation and visual analog scales 
      about four items (constipation, diarrhea, abdominal bloating and abdominal pain) 
      were filled by all subjects. Colonic transit time (CTT) was measured in fasting
      conditions and after eating a standard 1,000-cal test meal. CRF was quantified by
      calculating the variation in number of markers between the two films. RESULTS:
      The frequency of meal-related symptoms did not vary among the different groups of
      patients but was significantly higher than in controls. Compared to IBS-C
      patients, constipated patients of the group C had longer total and segmental
      colonic transit time, and compared to IBS-D patients, diarrheic patients of the
      group D had shorter oro-anal and segmental colonic transit time except in the
      recto-sigmoid area. CRF was different in patients and controls, and differed
      between IBS and non IBS patients with similar transit abnormalities. Stool output
      was greater in patients of the group D than in patients of the IBS-D group.
      CONCLUSION: The different subgroups of IBS patients have different CRF patterns, 
      distinct from subjects with constipation and diarrhea, but without abdominal
      pain.

TI  - Does a self-management program change dietary intake in adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome?
PG  - 108-16
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e31821092e8 [doi]
AB  - Making dietary changes such as increasing fiber intake is recommended for the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Few studies have explored the
      efficacy of education on compliance with recommendations such as increasing
      fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome. This 
      study examined the effect of a multicomponent self-management intervention that
      included strategies to enhance fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake. Participants
      with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were randomized to usual care
      or individualized comprehensive self-management, delivered either in-person or by
      telephone. Since previously published analyses show the two delivery modes to be 
      equally effective, the two intervention groups were combined. Of the 188
      individuals randomized, 173 participants (113 in the self-management group and 60
      in the usual care group; 23 men, 150 women) provided data on at least one of the 
      three follow-up occasions (3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization). Fiber,
      vegetable, and fruit intakes were measured using the Food Frequency
      Questionnaire. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated increases (p <
      .05) in fiber and fruit intake and a trend in vegetable intake at 6 and 12 months
      postintervention. Improvement in dietary fiber intake following a self-management
      intervention for IBS continues to 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Food-related symptoms are commonly described by patients with
      functional bowel disorders, but dietary change as an evidence-based therapy has
      not been part of routine management strategies. This reviews aims to discuss
      strategies commonly applied. METHOD: Published literature was reviewed. RESULTS: 
      Traditional approaches involve elimination diets followed by placebo-controlled
      reintroduction of specific foods, which is tedious at best and not applied in
      routine practice. Pathogenically-based approaches include determining what food
      components are inducing food hypersensitivity responses using specific
      biomarkers, but this is probably applicable to a small proportion of patients
      only and has met with only limited success. Food bioactive chemicals, such as
      salicylates, have been targeted, but there is a paucity of quality evidence for
      or against this approach. In contrast, targeting poorly absorbed dietary
      components that might induce luminal distension via osmotic effects and rapid
      fermentation (FODMAPs) has been successful and the efficacy of the
      dietitian-delivered low FODMAP diet is now supported by high quality evidence.
      Improvement of all symptoms of FBD in three out of four patients has been
      achieved. The diet may potentially improve stool frequency in patients with an
      ileal pouch or a high output ileostomy, or functional symptoms in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. FODMAPs in enteral formulas may also be responsible
      for diarrhoea induced by enteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction of
      FODMAPs is an effective therapy in the majority of patients with functional bowel
      symptoms and, provided dietitians are trained in the technique, should be first
      line therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent
      functional disorder with poor understanding on its pathogenesis and pathology.
      China has huge amount of population and have a lot of literatures on IBS in
      Chinese publications. The aim of this article was to review the reported
      investigations on IBS in China and discuss the difference between China and other
      country. METHODS: Literatures pertaining IBS epidemiology, pathogenesis and
      pathophysiology, which published in the high level journals in china and SCI
      journals after 1998 were reviewed. RESULT: In the general health population, 5-6%
      meets the Rome II IBS criteria. Intestinal infection, food intolerance, genetic
      factor and psychological disturbance were responsible for the pathogenesis of
      IBS. In IBS patients, the impaired reaction to rectal distension, abnormal
      gastrointestinal motility, impaired autonomic nerve function, weakened colon
      epithelium connection, altered cerebral nuclei activation were the main
      pathophysiological findings. CONCLUSION: Comparing to the findings from other
      area, literatures from China provided more evidences on epidemiological data of
      IBS in China, post-infection IBS, visceral hypertension and gastrointestinal
      motility abnormalities in IBS. This detailed literature review may help the
      understanding and promoting the future studies on IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms are quite common among the
      general population, but different survey methods show different epidemiology, and
      the effect of psychosocial and behavioral factors on the symptoms have been
      studied mainly by the subgroup The aims of this studies are; 1: to clarify the
      difference of the survey methods on the epidemiology of FGID symptoms, 2:
      correlation with psycho-behavioral background in symptomatic subjects. METHODS:
      Questionnaires focused on GI symptoms and psycho-behavioral background were
      generated. Questionnaires were sent via e-mail and postal mail to the members of 
      the registered panel. RESULTS: A total of 2125 and 11,020 responses were
      recovered from electronic survey and postal survey. Significant difference in the
      prevalence of GI symptoms, 47% in electronic survey and 25% in postal survey,
      were observed. Despite the difference in the prevalence, the proportions of
      symptom subtypes and the patterns of the overlaps were similar in the two
      methods. In the analysis of the effect of psycho-behavioral factors, this study
      showed that those who have higher level of psycho-behavioral problem had higher
      prevalence of GERD, FD and IBS symptoms. Those who have impairment in the
      wellness sensation such as good eating, good bowel movement and good sleep showed
      higher prevalence of each symptom. Those who prefer unhealthier food have higher 
      prevalence of GI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that psycho-behavioral
      conditions may affect the development of functional GI symptoms regardless of the
      subtypes of GI symptoms, and may explain the high proportion of overlap in the
      subtypes.

PG  - 663-72
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2011.565066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms has been mixed, but remains
      an intriguing treatment option with appeal to the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized double-blind to a daily 
      intake of 500 ml of fermented milk containing at least 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml of
      Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and
      Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or an equal volume of acidified milk for 8 weeks.
      Symptoms were assessed at baseline and weekly using a disease-specific validated 
      symptom rating scale (IBS-SSI). The predefined primary outcome measure was
      patient reported adequate symptom relief. Adherence to study protocol were
      assessed by performing stool samples at the of the treatment period. RESULTS:
      Eight-one patients were screened. Sixty-four patients were randomized; 18
      patients did not complete the study due to protocol violations or withdrew due to
      lack of effect. Fifty-two patients (13 males) completed the study as per
      protocol; mean age was 51.3 years (range 29-67). The proportion of patients
      reporting adequate symptom relief increased in both patient groups, but there was
      not any statistical difference between the groups. IBS-SSI scores did not differ 
      statistically between the groups at the end of the treatment period, but improved
      during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: During this 8-week trial
      gastrointestinal symptoms improved. However, there was no difference between
      treatment with fermented milk containing probiotics or acidified milk. The effect
      of probiotics on IBS symptoms remains uncertain and further studies are
      warranted.

      effect. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus
      NCFM (L-NCFM) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 (B-LBi07) in nonconstipation FBDs.
      METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial of the probiotic
      bacterias L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day (2x10(11) CFU/d) versus placebo over 8
      weeks. Primary endpoints were global relief of gastrointestinal symptoms and
      satisfaction with treatment. Secondary endpoints were change in symptoms
      severity, well-being, and quality of life. Microbiological effect was assessed by
      quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction on fecal samples. RESULTS: Sixty
      patients (probiotic, n=31; placebo, n=29), 72% females, 84% whites, mean age 37
      years. Abdominal bloating improved in the probiotics compared with the placebo
      group at 4 weeks (4.10 vs 6.17, P=0.009; change in bloating severity P=0.02) and 
      8 weeks (4.26 vs 5.84, P=0.06; change in bloating severity P<0.01). Analyses on
      the irritable bowel syndrome subgroup (n=33) showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS:
      L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day improve symptoms of bloating in patients with
      FBDs. These data supports the role of intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology 
      of FBD and the role for probiotic bacteria in the management of these disorders.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 significantly
      alleviates irritable bowel syndrome and improves quality of life--a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1123-32

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that an imbalance of the intestinal
      microbiota and a dysfunctional intestinal barrier might trigger irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). As probiotics have been reported to restore the intestinal
      microbiota and the gut barrier, the therapeutic potential of probiotics within
      IBS became of strong interest. AIM: To assess the efficacy of Bifidobacterium
      bifidum MIMBb75 in IBS. METHODS: A total of 122 patients were randomised to
      receive either placebo (N=62) or MIMBb75 (N=60) once a day for 4 weeks. The
      severity of IBS symptoms was recorded daily on a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS:
      MIMBb75 significantly reduced the global assessment of IBS symptoms by -0.88
      points (95% CI: -1.07; -0.69) when compared with only -0.16 (95% CI: -0.32; 0.00)
      points in the placebo group (P<0.0001). MIMBb75 also significantly improved the
      IBS symptoms pain/discomfort, distension/bloating, urgency and digestive
      disorder. The evaluation of the SF12 sum scores showed a significant gain in
      quality of life within the bifidobacteria group. Furthermore, adequate relief was
      reported by 47% of the patients in the bifidobacteria and only by 11% of the
      patients in the placebo group (P<0.0001). Overall responder rates were 57% in the
      bifidobacteria group but only 21% in the placebo group (P=0.0001). MIMBb75 was
      well tolerated and adverse events were not different from placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 effectively alleviates global IBS and improves
      IBS symptoms simultaneously with an improvement of quality of life. Considering
      the high efficacy of MIMBb75 in IBS along with the good side-effect profile,
      MIMBb75 is a promising candidate for IBS therapy.

TI  - Neuroimmune mechanisms in functional bowel disorders.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - The enteric nervous system regulates diverse functions including gastrointestinal
      motility and nociception. The sensory neurons detect mechanical and chemical
      stimuli while motor neurons control peristalsis and secretion. In addition to
      this extensive neuronal network, the gut also houses a highly specialised immune 
      system which plays an important role in the induction and maintenance of
      tolerance to food and other luminal antigens and in the protection of the
      epithelial barrier against pathogenic invasion. It is now increasingly recognised
      that the gastrointestinal immune system and the enteric nervous system closely
      interact. This review will focus on two common functional gastrointestinal
      disorders in which neuroimmune interaction is involved in the pathophysiology:
      i.e. postoperative ileus and irritable bowel syndrome. Postoperative ileus arises
      after almost every abdominal surgical procedure. Handling of the bowel results in
      local inflammation and activation of inhibitory neuronal pathways resulting in a 
      generalised impairment of gastrointestinal motor function or ileus. On the other 
      hand, postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) occurs in 10 to 30% of
      patients who suffer from infectious gastroenteritis. PI -IBS patients develop
      abnormal gastrointestinal sensitivity, motility and secretion which contribute to
      abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating and abnormal bowel function (diarrhoea
      and/or constipation). Biopsy studies revealed persistent low-grade inflammation
      and altered immunological function which may lead to abnormal pain perception and
      motor activity within the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - The role of psyllium fibre supplementation in treating irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - e107-14
AB  - North American family physicians and dietitians commonly recommend psyllium fibre
      supplementation for treating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this 
      review, evidence on the effectiveness of psyllium supplementation for diagnosed
      IBS symptoms was evaluated and summarized. A systematic search of MEDLINE,
      CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Included were full-length,
      peer-reviewed, English-language articles in which psyllium ingestion was tested
      for its effect on IBS symptoms. Quality of these articles also was assessed.
      Twelve met the criteria for complete data abstraction. Seventy-five percent of
      the studies examined were of weak quality. Study designs and methods were
      heterogeneous. Patient-perceived global symptoms improved significantly in six of
      the nine studies measuring a global symptom outcome. In one study, significant
      improvements occurred in reported abdominal pain; in three, improvement did not
      occur. Quality of life and flatulence did not improve significantly in any
      studies in which these outcomes were examined. The results of this systematic
      review indicate limited and conflicting evidence to support the recommendation of
      psyllium supplementation for symptomatic IBS treatment.

AB  - AIM: To study the natural history and prevalence of heartburn at a 10-year
      interval, and to study the effect of heartburn on various symptoms and
      activities. METHODS: A population-based postal study was carried out.
      Questionnaires were mailed to the same age- and gender-stratified random sample
      of the Icelandic population (aged 18-75 years) in 1996 and again in 2006.
      Subjects were classified with heartburn if they reported heartburn in the
      preceding year and/or week, based on the definition of heartburn. RESULTS:
      Heartburn in the preceding year was reported in 42.8% (1996) and 44.2% (2006) of 
      subjects, with a strong relationship between those who experienced heartburn in
      both years. Heartburn in the preceding week was diagnosed in 20.8%. There was a
      significant relationship between heartburn, dyspepsia and irritable bowel
      syndrome. Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) below or higher than normal
      weight were more likely to have heartburn. Heartburn caused by food or beverages 
      was reported very often by 20.0% of subjects. CONCLUSION: Heartburn is a common
      and chronic condition. Subjects with a BMI below or higher than normal weight are
      more likely to experience heartburn. Heartburn has a great impact on daily
      activities, sleep and quality of life.

TI  - [Guidelines for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 82-99
AB  - Traditional symptom-based therapies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are
      directed at the relief of individual IBS symptoms, but they are often of limited 
      efficacy in addressing the entire symptom complex. Combinations of drugs to
      target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic
      treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms
      of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches.
      Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the
      modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving
      symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber,
      bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the
      improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents
      for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain
      and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and
      5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and
      individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short
      term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms,
      particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear
      to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2
      chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS
      symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Both tricyclic
      antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are equally effective
      in relieving global IBS symptoms, and have some benefits in treating abdominal
      pain. Certain types of psychologic therapy may be effective in improving global
      symptoms in some IBS patients. Further studies are strongly needed to develop
      better treatment strategies for Korean patients with IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder,
      characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain and bloating. Complementary 
      and alternative medicine (CAM) is a diverse group of medical treatments that are 
      not commonly considered to be a part of conventional medicine yet frequently used
      together with conventional medicine. CAM is widely used, particularly for chronic
      medical conditions that are difficult to treat. Because only a limited number of 
      treatments are available for IBS, many patients choose CAM. This article reviews 
      current evidence supporting the use of CAM in IBS, with a focus on prebiotics,
      acupuncture, and herbal medicines.

      gut microbiota and/or a low-grade inflammatory state may contribute to
      symptomatology and the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Consequent on 
      these hypotheses, several therapeutic categories have found their way into the
      armamentarium of those who care for IBS sufferers. These agents include
      probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents.

AB  - Gut-acting therapies are common therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Most of these peripheral acting agents are primarily targeted at individual
      symptoms. The evidence supporting the use of these agents in IBS is largely
      anecdotal. Serotonergic agents and the chloride channel activator lubiprostone
      have shown efficacy in treating symptoms of IBS. The clinical evidence supporting
      the use of these agents is based on data from high-quality clinical trials. The
      use of serotonergic agents for IBS in the United States is limited to the
      5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonist alosetron in the treatment of women with severe 
      IBS with diarrhea refractory to traditional therapy.

AB  - After years of inattention, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that
      dietary constituents at least exacerbate symptoms and perhaps contribute to the
      pathogenesis of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although patients with IBS
      self-report food allergies more often than the general population, the evidence
      suggests that true food allergies are relatively uncommon. Less clearly defined
      food intolerances may be an important contributor to symptoms in IBS patients.
      This article reviews the literature supporting a causal link between food and the
      symptoms of IBS as well as the evidence supporting dietary interventions as a
      means of managing IBS symptoms.

AB  - A "biomarker" (biological marker) is an indicator of a bodily function that can
      be objectively measured. A wide range of possible biomarkers for IBS have been
      considered but at present only gut transit measured using radio-isotope markers
      meet the criteria of reproducibility and availability. While barostat studies
      perform reasonably in expert centers, to do them reproducibly requires
      considerable effort and standardization. This makes them unsuitable for
      widespread use. However radio-isotope tests are expensive and of limited
      availability so the search for other more convenient markers including blood and 
      stool tests is still an important goal for the future.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal condition,
      affecting 10% to 20% of adults in developed countries. Over the last few years,
      growing evidence has supported a new hypothesis for IBS based on alterations in
      intestinal bacterial composition. This article reviews the evidence for a
      bacterial concept in IBS and begins to formulate a hypothesis of how these
      bacterial systems could integrate in a new pathophysiologic mechanism in the
      development of IBS. Data suggesting an interaction between this gut flora and
      inflammation in the context of IBS is also presented.

AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common disorders in
      gastroenterological practice with a prevalence of approx. 12 % in Germany, and it
      is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, altered stool frequency and
      consistency, and meteorism and bloating. There is currently no agreement between 
      those seeing patients with IBS (general practitioner, gastroenterologist,
      psychosomatics) on the criteria for clinical diagnosis. Metaanalyses of treatment
      studies in IBS have shown that probiotics have a high clinical efficacy in IBS,
      especially since development of novel pharmaceutical compounds have not reached
      the market or have been withdrawn. In addition to the actual status of probiotic 
      efficacy in IBS studies conducted worldwide, we present 3 German clinical studies
      with probiotic E.COLI preparations that have proven their efficacy in IBS in
      adults and in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Similar to other bacterial or protozoan infections, human
      cryptosporidiosis may trigger postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like 
      symptoms, a condition in which enhanced visceral perception of pain during
      intestinal distension plays a pivotal role. In an immunocompetent suckling rat
      model which mimicks features of postinfectious IBS, Cryptosporidium parvum
      infection induces long-lasting jejunal hypersensitivity to distension in
      association with intestinal activated mast cell accumulation. The aim of the
      present study was to explore in this model whether octreotide, a somatostatin
      agonist analog, could prevent the development of jejunal hypersensitivity and
      intestinal mast cell/nerve fiber accumulation. METHODS: Five-day-old
      Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with C. parvum and treated 10 days later with
      octreotide (50 g kg(-1) day(-1), i.p.) for 7 days. KEY RESULTS: Compared with
      untreated infected rats, octreotide treatment of infected rats resulted in
      increased weight gain [day 23 postinfection (PI)], decreased food intake (day 16 
      PI), and a reduction in jejunal villus alterations (day 14 PI), CD3(+) IEL (day
      37 PI) and mast cell (days 37 and 50 PI) accumulations, nerve fiber densities
      (day 50 PI), and hypersensitivity to distension (day 120 PI). In uninfected rats,
      the effects of octreotide treatment were limited to higher weight gain (days 16
      and 23 PI) and decreased food intake (day 23 PI) compared with
      uninfected-untreated rats. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Data confirms the relevance 
      of the present rat model to postinfectious IBS studies and prompt further
      investigation of somatostatin-dependent regulatory interactions in
      cryptosporidiosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics confer health benefits to the host. However, its clinical 
      effect on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial. AIMS: This study was
      aimed to evaluate the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii on quality of life (QOL)
      and symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS or mixed-type IBS.
      METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with IBS were randomized either to receive S.
      boulardii at 2x10 live cells as a daily dose (n=34), or placebo (n=33) for 4
      weeks. IBS-QOL was assessed at the beginning and end of the treatment phase.
      IBS-related symptoms, bowel movement frequency, and stool consistency were
      recorded on a daily basis and assessed each week. RESULTS: The overall
      improvement in IBS-QOL was higher in S. boulardii group than placebo (15.4% vs
      7.0%; P<0.05). All eight domains of IBS-QOL were significantly improved in S.
      boulardii group; however, placebo group only showed improvements in dysphoria and
      health worry. Composite scores for IBS symptoms were significantly reduced in
      both groups to a similar extent. Bowel frequency and stool consistency did not
      change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: S. boulardii improved IBS-QOL better than
      placebo but was not superior for individual symptoms in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS or mixed-type IBS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterised by episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits.
      Many IBS sufferers believe that diet may play a role in triggering these episodes
      and may avoid certain foods. However relatively few studies have undertaken a
      dietary assessment in IBS sufferers to examine the wider impact of the condition 
      upon diet. METHODS: 104 individuals with IBS were recruited and asked to complete
      a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The data were analysed against
      Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom and
      observed intakes for the general population and for differences between IBS
      subtypes and the UK population. RESULTS: The data show that the dietary intakes
      of this population of IBS sufferers met the UK Dietary Reference Values. The
      average energy intake of the population exceeded the Estimated Average
      Requirements of the UK population and the balance of macronutrients was
      favourable. Intakes of selected micronutrients significantly exceeded the
      reference nutrient intakes. There were no differences between IBS subtypes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The IBS subpopulation appear to have an adequate and balanced
      macronutrient intake with no evidence of inadequate micronutrient intake.

TI  - Health benefits of probiotics: are mixtures more effective than single strains?
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s00394-010-0166-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes
      incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of
      probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures 
      are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more
      or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: 
      Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including
      irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune
      function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation,
      inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
      However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its
      component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more
      effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide
      range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain
      probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains
      that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to
      synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic
      dose used in some studies is at present unclear.

TI  - Alosetron for severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: improving
      patient outcomes.
PG  - 503-12
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2010.547933 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder 
      often diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians (PCPs). Despite the high
      prevalence of IBS, symptom severity is often underappreciated and inadequately
      managed. The goal of this review is to discern IBS treatment gaps and identify
      opportunities for improving its management in the primary care setting, as well
      as describe the most current clinical experience with alosetron, a targeted
      treatment for severe diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) in women. SCOPE: PubMed was
      searched for English language articles using combinations of the following key
      words: 'irritable bowel syndrome,' 'diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome,' 'diagnosis,' 'guidelines,' 'general practice,' 'primary care,'
      'quality of life,' 'burden,' 'prevalence,' 'patient satisfaction,' 'patient
      survey,' 'severe,' 'severity,' and 'alosetron.' FINDINGS: Establishing the
      diagnosis of IBS in primary care represents a clinical challenge for many
      healthcare professionals. While many patients seek care for IBS symptoms in the
      primary care setting, evidence shows that PCPs are often unaware of established
      diagnostic criteria for IBS. Establishing the severity of IBS is also
      problematic, given the lack of consensus guidelines defining severe IBS, which in
      turn complicates treatment decisions. Severe IBS is often inferred after
      inadequate response to conventional agents; the level of disease impact on
      quality of life and patient functioning also defines severity. The selective
      5-HT(3) antagonist alosetron has been shown to provide improvement across
      multiple symptom domains, and the incidence of adverse events continues to be low
      since the implementation of the Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Alosetron is
      the only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of
      severe IBS-D in women. CONCLUSION: PCPs often are required to evaluate and treat 
      suspected IBS. The diagnosis and management of IBS in the primary care setting
      could be optimized through the use of published diagnostic criteria, adequate
      assessment of symptom severity, and a thorough knowledge of the therapeutic
      agents that have provided evidence of effectiveness. In the subset of women who
      suffer from IBS-D, targeted serotonergic therapy with alosetron has been shown to
      provide symptom relief across multiple domains, including improvement of the
      patient's quality of life.

TI  - Diet, disease activity, and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1007/s10067-010-1625-x [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate, firstly, the relationship between
      diet and disease activity and, secondly, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and their relationship to diet among patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) using a cross-sectional design. One hundred sixty-five
      individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal
      questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal 
      symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., 
      the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation
      between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients
      reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain
      foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal
      pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status
      according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively).
      Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher
      consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured
      milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In
      multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were
      independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To
      conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and
      disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between
      diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be
      prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.

LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e328341dc67 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the recent studies which have enhanced our
      appreciation of the composition of the microbiota in the human small intestine
      and its relevance to the health of the host. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past number 
      of years, the composition of the microorganisms present in our small intestines
      has been the subject of greater scrutiny than ever before. These investigations
      have been possible as a consequence of the development and utilization of new
      molecular tools which have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology and have
      focused predominantly on the small intestinal microbiota associated with
      pediatric celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome
      and pouchitis. The impact of invasive procedures, such as small bowel transplant,
      ileostomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis, on the ileal microbiota has also been
      investigated. SUMMARY: The ever greater appreciation of the link between the
      small intestinal microbiota and the health status of the host has the potential
      to lead to the development of new strategies to alter this microbiota in a
      targeted way to prevent or treat specific disorders.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incidence of gastrointestinal infections continues to
      increase and infectious colitis contributes to significant morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent
      advances in knowledge of pathogens causing infectious colitis. We describe the
      various pathogens and specifically focus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
      (EHEC) O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Entamoeba histolytica
      infections, and their impact on long-term effects, including postinfectious
      irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Salmonella, Campylobacter, and EHEC outbreaks continue to occur with disturbing
      regularity. Peanut butter and peppers were recently responsible for outbreaks of 
      nontyphoid Salmonella. Recent research has identified Salmonella genes required
      for colonization of various hosts and transposon-mediated differential
      hybridization was recently used to identify genes required during infection in
      different animal models. A number of other strains of EHEC in addition to O157:H7
      are emerging as serious threats to food safety in the USA. Campylobacter jejuni
      isolates are of interest because of absence of genes encoding for classical
      enterotoxins, and lack of plasmids encoding genes promoting bacterial invasion.
      Recent research has identified that the organism is able to invade and replicate 
      in infected epithelia via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4. Also patients
      with infectious colitis, in particular Salmonella and Campylobacter, are at
      increased risk of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel 
      disease on long-term follow-up. The paradigm of Entamoeba histolytica infection
      is changing with recent reports of detection of E. dispar deoxyribonucleic acid
      sequences, previously considered nonpathogenic. SUMMARY: There has been an
      explosion in the understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology, and mechanisms 
      underlying infectious colitis. Additional studies to address prevention
      strategies and strict screening modalities for these infections are necessary.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption: true condition or a variance from normality.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181eed6bf [doi]
AB  - Fructose exists in food naturally or as a sweetening additive. It has been
      thought that fructose malabsorption may cause the gastrointestinal symptoms seen 
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, fructose malabsorption is
      still poorly understood, and clinicians are still uncertain of its role. This
      review attempts to clarify the relation between fructose malabsorption and
      symptoms in normal individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The
      main problem lies in the diagnosis. First, there is no definite cut off value for
      the breath tests. Second, we are unsure of the normal absorptive capacity of
      fructose in normal individuals. Normal individuals will have a degree of fructose
      malabsorption with or without symptoms depending on the dose of fructose used.
      From earlier studies, 25 g of fructose seems to be the cut-off dose to
      investigate fructose malabsorption, with a positive breath test at this dose
      suggesting abnormally low capacity to absorb fructose. This low level may be
      difficult to exclude from the daily diet, resulting in symptoms of fructose
      malabsorption.

TI  - GLP-1 playing the role of a gut regulatory compound.
PG  - 151-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02150.x [doi]
AB  - Gastric emptying is the first step in the metabolic endocrine cascade that takes 
      place after food intake. The incretin hormones originating in the gut,
      particularly GLP-1, exert multiple antihyperglycaemic actions such as enhancement
      of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion,
      slowing of gastric emptying with an ensuing decrease in food intake and weight
      loss. From extensive studies in experimental animals and humans we have found
      that GLP-1 also exerts a motility-inhibiting and antispasmodic effect in the gut 
      that was verified in healthy volunteers and patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). In order to further investigate the effect of GLP-1 in humans, we
      used the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV resistant GLP-1 analogue ROSE-010, thereby
      extending its biological activity. A randomized, double-blinded, prospective
      clinical trial was carried out in order to investigate the effect of two doses of
      ROSE-010 in 166 patients suffering from pain attacks of IBS. We found that
      injections of ROSE-010 were twice as effective as placebo in terms of total pain 
      relief response in those affected by pain attacks due to IBS. Our results show
      that basal physiological research studies can be translated into clinical use.
      The current pharmaceutical incentive with incretin mimetics, such as GLP-1
      analogues and exenatide, is an interesting development that apart from its
      obvious use in diabetes type 2, may also be useful in terms of gut
      motility-regulating effects with effects on appetite, food intake and motility
      disorders that may provide an opportunity to bring about new improvements in
      medical care.
