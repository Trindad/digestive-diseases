TI  - [Risk factors of irritable bowel syndrome in adolescents in China].
PG  - 136-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among
      school adolescents in China. METHOD: A stratified, randomized study by cluster
      sampling was conducted, which recruited 51,956 students from high and primary
      schools in Chinese cities. All students were requested to fill in a
      questionnaire. RESULT: (1) Factors including class (odds ratio 1.12), excessive
      intake of pepper (odds ratio 1.17), fried (odds ratio 1.08) and starch-based
      foods (odds ratio 1.06), gastrointestinal tract infection (odds ratio 2.66),
      abuse of analgesic (odds ratio 1.49), inheritance (odds ratio 1.83), fatigue
      (odds ratio 1.32) and repression (odds ratio 1.45) were significantly associated 
      with the presence of IBS (P < 0.05). High protein food (odds ratio 0.90) was a
      protective factor. CONCLUSION: Different food intake, gastrointestinal tract
      infection, abuse of analgesic, inheritance and psychological factors might be
      related to development of IBS in the students of the cities involved in this
      study.

TI  - The efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 325-32
LID - 10.1136/gut.2008.167270 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic
      review was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May
      2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases
      were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW
      (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra
      information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing
      probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any
      acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in
      abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and
      data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were
      synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous
      data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random
      effects models. RESULTS: 19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were
      identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate
      methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There
      were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable.
      Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not
      improving=0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT)=4 (95%
      CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=28.3, p=0.001,
      I(2)=68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351
      patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD=-0.34;
      95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity
      (chi(2)=67.04, p<0.001, I(2)=79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial. 
      CONCLUSION: Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of
      benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.

TI  - Lubiprostone for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 727-33
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2.6.727 [doi]
AB  - Chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome are heterogeneous disorders
      characterized by altered bowel habits, abdominal discomfort and/or difficult
      defecation. These conditions have a significant impact on patients' quality of
      life, as well as on the US economy, both in terms of healthcare costs and lost
      productivity. Treatment typically begins with lifestyle changes, increased fiber 
      intake and osmotic and stimulant laxative intake. However, treatments for
      constipation vary in terms of their efficacy and safety. Furthermore, surveys of 
      physicians and patients have revealed a strong desire for improved therapeutic
      options. Lubiprostone is a synthetic bicyclic fatty acid that is gut selective
      and stimulates type 2 chloride channels, resulting in increased chloride, sodium 
      and water secretion into the lumen. The increased fluid secretion causes luminal 
      distension, secondary peristalsis and laxation. Randomized Phase III trials have 
      shown that lubiprostone is efficacious in the treatment of chronic idiopathic
      constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The US FDA has
      approved lubiprostone at a dose of 24 microg twice daily for the treatment of
      chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, and at a dose of 8 microg twice daily 
      for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adult women. Nausea, diarrhea
      and headaches are the most commonly reported side effects. In long-term studies, 
      lubiprostone appears to be safe.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the T lymphocyte subgroups and the levels of serum zinc
      (Zn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) in patients with diarrhea type of
      irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). METHODS: A total of 30 D-IBS patients and 30
      control subjects were enrolled in this study, and their peripheral blood samples 
      were collected. The percentage of peripheral CD3, CD4, CD8 T lymphocytes were
      analyzed by flow cytometry, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was calculated. Serum Zn, Fe
      and Cu levels were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry(AAS), and the Se 
      level by atomic fluorometry. RESULT: Compared with control group,the percentage
      of CD4 T lymphocyte and the ratio of CD4/CD8 in D-IBS group were significantly
      lower (P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in serum Zn, Se, Fe,
      Cu levels between two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The declines of peripheral
      blood CD4 T lymphocytes and the ratio of CD4/CD8 may suggest a cellular immune
      abnormality in D-IBS patients. There was no significant difference in trace
      elements levels between the two groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy 
      of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic
      microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44
      patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel
      crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either
      3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored 
      weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal
      microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global
      assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
      RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 
      0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters
      monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency
      (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score
      of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly
      improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut
      bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These
      findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.

TI  - Experiences of older women increasing fruit and vegetable intake.
PG  - 418-22
AB  - Many studies have investigated diet in relation to disease and other aspects of
      health, although there is little information for health professionals on
      conveying practical ways for people to improve dietary intakes. There is thought 
      to be a positive link between bone health and fruit and vegetable intake. This
      paper reports on the experiences of older women increasing their fruit and
      vegetable intake while participating in a randomized controlled trial to assess
      the influence of fruit and vegetables on bone health. How the women achieved
      increases in fruit and vegetable intake is described.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil
      in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. DESIGN: Systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and
      the Cochrane controlled trials register up to April 2008. Review methods
      Randomised controlled trials comparing fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil 
      with placebo or no treatment in adults with irritable bowel syndrome were
      eligible for inclusion. The minimum duration of therapy considered was one week, 
      and studies had to report either a global assessment of cure or improvement in
      symptoms, or cure of or improvement in abdominal pain, after treatment. A random 
      effects model was used to pool data on symptoms, and the effect of therapy
      compared with placebo or no treatment was reported as the relative risk (95%
      confidence interval) of symptoms persisting. RESULTS: 12 studies compared fibre
      with placebo or no treatment in 591 patients (relative risk of persistent
      symptoms 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.00). This effect was limited to 
      ispaghula (0.78, 0.63 to 0.96). Twenty two trials compared antispasmodics with
      placebo in 1778 patients (0.68, 0.57 to 0.81). Various antispasmodics were
      studied, but otilonium (four trials, 435 patients, relative risk of persistent
      symptoms 0.55, 0.31 to 0.97) and hyoscine (three trials, 426 patients, 0.63, 0.51
      to 0.78) showed consistent evidence of efficacy. Four trials compared peppermint 
      oil with placebo in 392 patients (0.43, 0.32 to 0.59). CONCLUSION: Fibre,
      antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were all more effective than placebo in the
      treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Probiotics are microorganisms with potential health benefits. They may be used to
      prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea.
      They may also be effective in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and
      in treating atopic dermatitis in children. Species commonly used include
      Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Streptococcus thermophilus, and
      Saccharomyces boulardii. Typical dosages vary based on the product, but common
      dosages range from 5 to 10 billion colony-forming units per day for children, and
      from 10 to 20 billion colony-forming units per day for adults. Significant
      adverse effects are rare, and there are no known interactions with medications.

AB  - The gut contains a diverse bacterial flora that is acquired at birth and has a
      number of physiological functions. Administration of prebiotics or probiotics may
      favourably alter this gut microflora. Prebiotics are poorly digested
      oligosaccharides that promote the growth of desirable bacteria and may have other
      beneficial gastrointestinal and systemic effects. Probiotics are "helpful" human 
      bacteria that provide a variety of health benefits when administered exogenously.
      Probiotics produce beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of
      traveller's diarrhoea, viral diarrhoea, and diarrhoea in day care centres.
      Moreover, probiotics have been shown to reduce relapses associated with
      Clostridium difficile, and Lactobacilli are effective in the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Probiotics may also be efficacious in the
      treatment of gastroenteritis. Clinical studies of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease have proved disappointing, but beneficial effects in adults with
      irritable bowel syndrome have been reported with Bifidobacterium infantis 35624. 
      Lactobacilli GG reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and gut
      permeability in patients with atopic dermatitis, and administration of probiotics
      reduces the frequency and severity of atopic eczema when administered to pregnant
      women and then to newborn infants. In conclusion, probiotics are effective in the
      treatment and/or prevention of a number of conditions, including diarrhoea,
      irritable bowel syndrome and atopic dermatitis, and the product used should be
      selected based on the particular indication.

AB  - Recent advances in our understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the
      role of effectors and transmitters in the brain-gut axis have provided
      opportunities to develop new therapeutic agents for irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). Furthermore, human pharmacodynamic studies utilizing transit, colonic, or 
      rectal sensitivity and brain imaging have been useful in determining therapeutic 
      efficacy (particularly for drugs that act on motor function). This review
      provides an overview of medications that have not yet been approved for treatment
      of patients with IBS yet have shown promise in phase IIB trials. These include
      drugs that act on the serotonin receptor and transporter system: antidepressants,
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, opioids, cholecystokinin antagonists,
      neurokinin-antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase C
      agonists, atypical benzodiazepines, probiotics, and antibiotics. The changing
      landscape in the regulatory approval process has impacted the development of IBS 
      drugs. Guidance documents from regulatory agencies in Europe and the United
      States have focused on patients' reported outcomes and associated quality of
      life. After a decade of experience with different end points that have generated 
      some data on psychometric validation and unprecedented information about
      responsiveness of the binary or global end points to drug therapy, it is
      necessary to pursue further validation studies before or during pivotal phase IIB
      or III trials. The hope of providing relief to patients should galvanize all
      parties to achieve these goals.

AB  - To review the rationale and current evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in
      the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the following specific questions
      are addressed from a review of the published literature: Are bacterial flora
      altered in IBS? Is infection a significant risk factor for IBS? How prominent is 
      the inflammation in IBS? Do probiotics change bacterial flora? Do probiotics
      adhere to mucosa? What are the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics in
      IBS: immune function, motor, secretory, sensory, and fermentation? What is the
      efficacy of probiotics in IBS?

      evidence.
PG  - 633-58

AB  - Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through
      resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon
      intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial
      members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal
      microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial
      effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory
      processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and
      evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory
      animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and 
      the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies
      in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system
      may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of
      intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten
      trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious
      outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in 
      specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in
      animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal
      inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but
      findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the
      results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of
      immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain
      intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Improved arthritic knee health in a pilot RCT of phytotherapy.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Although practitioner-prescribed 'western' herbal medicine (phytotherapy) is a
      popular complementary therapy in the UK, no clinical studies have been reported
      on patient-orientated outcomes. The objective of this pilot study was to
      investigate the effects of phytotherapy on symptoms of osteoarthritis of the
      knee. A previous study of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of irritable 
      bowel syndrome, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
      acted as a model in the development of the protocol of this investigation. Twenty
      adults, previously diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee, were recruited from
      two Inner London GP practices into this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, pilot study carried out in a primary-care setting. All
      subjects were seen in consultation three times by a herbal practitioner who was
      blinded to the randomization coding. Each subject was prescribed treatment and
      given lifestyle advice according to usual practice: continuation of conventional 
      medication where applicable, healthy-eating advice and nutrient supplementation. 
      Individualized herbal medicine was prescribed for each patient, but only
      dispensed for those randomized to active treatment-- the remainder were supplied 
      with a placebo. At baseline and outcome (after ten weeks of treatment), subjects 
      completed a food frequency questionnaire and the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee health and Measure Yourself
      Outcome Profile (MYMOP) wellbeing questionnaires. Subjects completing the study
      per protocol (n = 14) reported an increased intake of wholegrain foods (p =
      0.045) and oily fish (p = 0.039) compared to baseline, but no increase in fruit
      and vegetables and dairy products intakes. There was no difference in the primary
      outcome measure of knee health assessed as the difference in the mean response
      (baseline-week 10) in WOMAC score between the two treatment groups. However,
      there was, compared with baseline, improvement in the active group (n = 9) for
      the mean WOMAC stiffness sub-score at week 5 (p = 0.035) and week 10 (p = 0.060) 
      but not in the placebo group (n = 5). Furthermore, for the active, but not the
      placebo group, the mean WOMAC total and sub-scores all showed clinically
      significant improvement (> or = 20%) in knee symptoms at weeks 5 and 10 compared 
      with baseline. Moreover, the mean MYMOP symptom 2 sub-score, mostly relating to
      osteoarthritis (OA), showed significant improvement at week 5 (p = 0.02) and week
      10 (p = 0.008) compared with baseline for the active, but not for the placebo
      group. This pilot study showed that herbal medicine prescribed for the individual
      by a herbal practitioner resulted in improvement of symptoms of OA of the knee.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on abdominal distension and gastrointestinal
      transit in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03853.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in
      girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed
      transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with
      acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with 
      constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control
      product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms
      were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS:
      Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant
      reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference -
      39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension
      during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal 
      [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P =
      0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P =
      0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in
      objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as
      reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit 
      is a useful strategy for treating distension.

TI  - Are gastrointestinal symptoms related to diabetes mellitus and glycemic control?
PG  - 822-5
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3282f5f75e [doi]
AB  - Many patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from upper and lower GI symptoms. The
      reported prevalence of these symptoms varies among different ethnic
      groups/populations. The natural history of GI symptoms as well as their
      pathogenesis in patients with diabetes remains poorly understood, although it is 
      known that gastric emptying is influenced by hyperglycemia, euglycemia, and
      hypoglycemia. Poor glycemic control over a long period of time can lead to
      neuropathy and damage the vagus nerve, resulting in diabetic gastroparesis whose 
      signs and symptoms vary in the individual patient. Gastroparesis can further
      worsen glycemic control by adversely altering the pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered hypoglycemic agents as well as by altering the delivery of
      diet-derived calories to intestines from which absorption, subsequently,
      determines incipient blood glucose, and thus effectiveness of various injectable 
      antidiabetics including various insulins and related insulin analogs. As GI
      symptoms may overlap with other disorders, including functional dyspepsia,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, it is important to have such
      patients/patients with diabetes undergo standardized testing for measuring
      gastric emptying. Certain medications including metformin, amylin analogues (i.e.
      pramlintide), glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (i.e. exenatide, liraglutide),
      anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, calcium-channel blockers, and others may
      contribute to GI symptoms observed in patients with diabetes. Given the global
      diabetes pandemic, it is of utmost importance to not only diagnose and treat
      present patients with diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities, but also to help
      prevent the development of further disease burden by educating children and
      adolescents about healthy lifestyle modifications (avoidance of overeating,
      portion control, healthy food choices, increased physical and reduced sedentary
      activity), as changing behavior in adulthood has proven to be notoriously
      difficult.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To
      investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms
      of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS.
      METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria,
      participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising
      two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB
      30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum
      CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8
      weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly
      during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A
      significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in
      scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was 
      observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the
      probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain
      probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.

PG  - 704-8
LID - 10.1016/j.coph.2008.08.007 [doi]
AB  - While a rationale for the use of probiotics can be developed for a number of
      functional gastrointestinal symptoms and syndromes and an experimental basis for 
      their use continues to emerge, the only functional disorder for which an adequate
      database of clinical trials of probiotics to permit an assessment of clinical
      efficacy exists is the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS has also attracted
      attention, in this regard, because of recent revelations with regard to the
      potential roles of the enteric flora and immune activation in the pathogenesis of
      IBS, thereby, leading to a re-awakening of interest in bacteriotherapy in this
      common and challenging disorder. Some recent randomized controlled studies attest
      to the efficacy of some probiotics in alleviating individual IBS symptoms while
      selected strains have a more global impact. Evidence for long-term efficacy is
      also beginning to emerge though more studies are needed in this regard. Several
      other issues complicate the interpretation of much of the literature in this
      area: lack of quality control, use of many different species, and, strains and,
      above all, significant deficiencies in trial methodology.

PG  - 507-16
LID - /S0034-98872008000400013 [doi]
AB  - Constipation affects 2% to 27% of individuals. It is associated to irritable
      bowel syndrome in 59% of cases, to a pelvic floor dysfunction in 29% and to a low
      transit time in 13%. During assessment of patients with constipation the effects 
      of medications and chronic diseases must be discarded and the ideal is to
      determine which type of functional disorder it present. An algorithm for the
      management of chronic idiopathic constipation, that includes a recommendation to 
      increase fiber and liquid intake as an initial approach and an orientation to the
      use of different laxatives, is presented. The usefulness of biofeedback in
      patients with pelvic floor dysfunction and without organic cause of constipation,
      is also discussed.

TI  - Probiotic effects on intestinal fermentation patterns in patients with irritable 
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 5020-4
AB  - AIM: To determine whether Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (Yakult) can alter
      small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), as tested by the lactulose breath
      test, and whether this is associated with changes in symptoms in irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: 18 patients with IBS (Rome II criteria), who showed an
      early rise in breath hydrogen with lactulose (ERBHAL), consumed 65 mL of Yakult
      daily for 6 wk. Lactulose breath test was repeated at the end of the treatment
      period. Symptoms were recorded daily using a 10 cm visual analogue scale.
      RESULTS: 14 patients completed the study, 9 (64%) had reversal of ERBHAL, with
      the median time of first rise in breath hydrogen increasing from 45 to 75 min (P 
      = 0.03). There was no significant improvement in the symptom score with probiotic
      therapy, except for wind (P = 0.04). Patients commencing with at least moderate
      symptoms and who no longer had ERBHAL at the end of treatment, showed improvement
      in the overall symptoms scores [median final score 5.3 (IQR 3.9-5.9), 55%
      reduction; n = 6] to a greater extent than those who had had persisting ERBHAL
      [final score 6.9 (5.0-7.0), 12% reduction; n = 5; P = 0.18]. CONCLUSION: Yakult
      is effective in altering fermentation patterns in the small bowel, consistent
      with reducing SIBO. The loss of ERBHAL was associated with reduced symptoms. The 
      true interpretation of these findings awaits a randomised, controlled trial.

TI  - The small intestine and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a batch process model.
PG  - 781-7
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.06.015 [doi]
AB  - Faults in a batch process model of the small intestine create the symptoms of all
      types of irritable bowel syndrome. The model has three sequential processing
      sections corresponding to the natural divisions of the intestine. It is governed 
      by a brain controller that is divided into four sub-controllers, each with a
      unique neurotransmitter. Each section has a sub-controller to manage transport.
      Sensors in the walls of the intestine provide input and output goes to the
      muscles lining the walls of the intestine. The output controls the speed of the
      food soup, moves it in both directions, mixes it, controls absorption, and
      transfers it to the next section at the correct speed (slow). The fourth
      sub-controller manages the addition of chemicals. It obtains input from the first
      section of the process via the signalling hormone Cholecystokinin and sends
      output to the muscles that empty the gall bladder and pancreas. The correct
      amounts of bile salts and enzymes are then added to the first section. The
      sub-controllers produce output only when input is received. When output is
      missing the enteric nervous system applies a default condition. This default
      condition normally happens when no food is in the intestine. If food is in the
      intestine and a transport sub-controller fails to provide output then the default
      condition moves the food soup to the end of that section. The movement is in one 
      direction only (forward), at a speed dependent on the amount and type of fibre
      present. Cereal, bean and vegetable fibre causes high speeds. This default high
      speed transport causes irritable bowel syndrome. A barrier is created when a
      section moving fast at the default speed, precedes a section controlled by a
      transport sub-controller. Then the sub-controller constricts the intestine to
      stop the fast flow. The barrier causes constipation, cramping, and bloating.
      Diarrhoea results when the section terminating the process moves at the fast
      default speed. Two problems can occur to prevent output from the sub-controllers.
      The first is a deficiency of one or more of the four neurotransmitters. The
      second is the destruction of sensors in the walls of the intestine by a toxic
      insult. A wide variety of symptoms can occur and their nature depends on which
      sub-controller (or combination of sub-controllers) is faulty, or which part(s) of
      the intestine are damaged.

TI  - Dietary survey and total dietary fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome attending a tertiary referral hospital.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on their chemical extraction, dietary fibers are classified
      into crude fibers and total dietary fibers (TDF). TDF gives the best estimate of 
      fiber content in the diet. Whereas data on intake of crude fibers are available, 
      there is a lack of data on intake of TDF in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). AIM: We assessed the TDF and its source in the diet of patients
      with IBS and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Based on their predominant symptoms,
      81 patients with IBS (according to Rome II criteria) were categorized into
      constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=48), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D, n=16) and
      mixed type (IBS-M, n=17). Information was collected on fiber supplementation and 
      preference for high-fiber food. A pretested, open-ended, semi-quantitative food
      frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information on food groups
      and TDF. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=89) were recruited as HC.
      The mean (SD) age of patients and HC was 36.5 (11.4) years (59 men), and 36 (12) 
      years (62 men), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (48%) were taking
      medicinal fiber supplements, of which 28 patients were taking supplements daily
      (2.10 [0.84] teaspoon full). The mean daily TDF intake was 51.7 (23.1) g vs. 52.3
      (21.6) g for patients and HC, respectively (p=0.8). The intake of TDF was similar
      in patients having less (n=41) or more (n=40) preference for fiber-rich foods (55
      [23] g vs. 47 [22] g, p=0.16). The daily mean cereal intake in patients was
      significantly lower than that in HC (322 g vs. 404 g, p=0.001). However,
      consumption of fruits (150 g vs. 80 g, p=0.001) and vegetables (348 g vs. 219 g, 
      p=0.006) was higher in patients in comparison with HC. There was a positive
      correlation between TDF with cereals (p=0.001), pulses (p=0.001), vegetables and 
      fruits (p=0.033) in patients with IBS but only with cereals (p=0.001) in HC.
      CONCLUSION: The intake of TDF in patients with IBS and HC is much higher than the
      dietary recommendation for healthy Indians. Patients with IBS consumed more
      fruits and vegetables rather than cereals as compared with HC.

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment of constipation: what is new?
PG  - 724-8
LID - 10.1016/j.coph.2008.07.008 [doi]
AB  - Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disease affecting 2-27% of the
      population in Western hemisphere. Approximately in half of patients the diagnosis
      of functional constipation is made after having ruled out secondary causes.
      Treatment of chronic functional constipation primarily addresses education on
      toilet habits, dietary advice, and patient reassurance. Further therapies are
      guided according to functional subtype slow-transit constipation, dyssynergic
      defecation, and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C).
      Traditionally, the pharmacologic treatment of constipation uses primarily bulking
      agents and/or laxatives (osmotic or secretory). However, often these therapies do
      not provide the desired improvement, have a short-lived efficacy and/or are
      accompanied by side-effects such as bloating and abdominal cramps. Thus, there is
      a clinical need for new, more potent drugs particularly for patients who are not 
      satisfactorily treated by conventional therapies. This review discusses recent
      developments in the pharmacologic treatment of chronic constipation including
      recently FDA-approved lubiprostone, emerging 5-HT receptors modifiers,
      investigational substances, and probiotics.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests a potential role of intestinal microbiota in irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology and symptom generation. Earlier studies
      based on classic microbiologic techniques hypothesized the presence of
      qualitative changes in intestinal microbiota in IBS patients. Recently, studies
      with molecular techniques have provided evidence of significant changes in
      microbial profiles in IBS and that the composition may be correlated with certain
      symptoms reported by patients. Although these studies are far from being
      exhaustive and conclusive they provide promising results that deserve further
      investigation. In addition, initial evidence indicated the presence of increased 
      amounts of bacteria in the upper small intestine of IBS patients, a condition
      know as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, the results of these
      studies have provided contradictory results suggesting that this area requires
      further work. These qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota
      may induce different effects on the intestinal mucosa including mucosal barrier
      defects and immune activation which may contribute to symptom generation. Studies
      in IBS patients have attempted to target changes in intestinal microflora with
      different therapeutic approaches, such as the use of prebiotics, probiotics,
      synbiotics, and nonabsorbable and systemic antibiotics. Overall, the results
      obtained in probiotic clinical trials suggest some beneficial effect over placebo
      in the relief of IBS symptoms. However, these results, although encouraging,
      should be confirmed in larger well-designed, placebo-controlled studies. A number
      of open questions remain to be addressed, including the dose, type, and time of
      administration of probiotics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Efficacy of symbiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) remains unknown. METHODS: Patients were randomized to a prebiotic (n=135), 
      or a symbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 (Flortec,
      n=132). Primary efficacy was the responder rate for pain and global relief of
      symptoms in the overall population and in patients with predominant diarrhea
      (n=47). Post hoc time-trend analyses for changes within each treatment were
      carried out. RESULTS: Patients with absent/mild pain amounted to 54.7% in the
      symbiotic group and to 57.4% in the prebiotic group at treatment week 4, and to
      53.9% and 53.4% at the end of treatment. Patients with amelioration of well-being
      were, respectively, 60.7% versus 61.7% at treatment week 4, and 63.3% versus
      60.9% at the end of treatment. Within each treatment group, patients with
      absent/mild pain increased in the Flortec and the prebiotic group, but time trend
      analyses were significant only for Flortec (P=0.019). In IBS-predominant
      diarrhea, Flortec significantly reduced bowel movements, pain, and IBS scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: To improve pain and well-being, Flortec is encouraging in patients
      with diarrhea predominant IBS. To establish its efficacy for the majority of IBS 
      patients, Flortec has to be compared with an inert placebo in future work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with
      diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the
      possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal
      permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a
      randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients
      were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus,
      Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum)
      or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and
      intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of
      lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the
      total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel
      permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023
      (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel
      permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However,
      colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo 
      group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean
      global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/-
      1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment
      for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.

TI  - Effects of chili on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in diarrhoea
      predominant irritable bowel syndrome: evidence for capsaicin-sensitive visceral
      nociception hypersensitivity.
PG  - 23-32

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients often complain of gastrointestinal
      symptoms after eating chili. However, the effect of chili ingestion on
      gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients has not been characterized. To study
      the effect of chili-containing foods on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 20 IBS-D patients underwent gastrointestinal
      symptoms and postprandial colonic transit evaluations after ingesting three
      different meals: (i) a standard meal, (ii) a spicy meal (a standard meal mixed
      with 2 g chili), and (iii) a standard meal with 2 g chili in capsules, in a
      randomized crossover fashion. Postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms were scored 
      every 15 min for 2 h using visual analogue scales. Thirty-eight healthy
      volunteers were used as controls. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and
      meals with chili capsules induced only mild abdominal burning relative to the
      standard meals (P < 0.05), whereas it induced significant levels of abdominal
      pain and burning in IBS-D patients (P < 0.05). Other gastrointestinal symptoms
      and postprandial colonic transit after spicy meals and meals with chili capsules 
      did not differ from standard meals in IBS-D and controls (P > 0.05).
      Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and controls reported similar oral burning
      symptoms when eating spicy meals (P > 0.05). Both the spicy meal and the standard
      meal with chili capsules led to similar severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (P 
      > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients exhibit gut hypersensitivity to
      chili. Chili ingestion produced more abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients
      than in healthy volunteers, but was associated with similar oral burning
      symptoms.

TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome an inflammatory disorder?
PG  - 385-90
AB  - Histopathologic data demonstrate low-grade mucosal inflammation in a subset of
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This inflammatory infiltrate is
      mainly represented by increased numbers of T lymphocytes and mast cells lying in 
      the lamina propria. The close apposition of immunocytes to gut nerves supplying
      the mucosa provides a basis for neuroimmune cross-talk, which may explain gut
      sensorimotor dysfunction and related symptoms in patients with IBS. A previous
      gastroenteritis (due to Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia
      coli, and, likely, viruses) is now an established etiologic factor for IBS
      (hence, postinfectious IBS). Other putative causes, such as undiagnosed food
      allergies, genetic abnormalities, stress, or bile acid malabsorption, may also
      promote and maintain a low-grade mucosal inflammation in IBS. The identification 
      of mucosal inflammation in IBS has pathophysiologic implications and paves the
      way for novel therapeutic options.

TI  - What is the evidence for the use of probiotics in functional disorders?
PG  - 379-84
AB  - A rationale for the use of probiotics for a number of functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms and syndromes can be developed, and an experimental basis for their use 
      continues to emerge, but data from well-conducted clinical trials of probiotics
      in this area remain scarce. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has attracted the most
      attention; recent revelations regarding the potential pathogenic roles of the
      enteric flora and immune activation have led to reawakened interest in
      bacterio-therapy for this common and challenging disorder. Some recent
      randomized, controlled studies attest to the efficacy of some probiotics in
      alleviating individual IBS symptoms, and selected strains have a more global
      impact. Evidence for long-term efficacy is also beginning to emerge, though more 
      studies are needed in this regard. In other functional syndromes, data are far
      from adequate to make recommendations, but there is evidence for efficacy of
      probiotics in treating individual symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, and
      bloating. The interpretation of much of the literature in this area is
      complicated by lack of quality control, use of many different species and
      strains, and, above all, significant deficiencies in trial methodology.

TI  - Randomized patients in IBS research had different disease characteristics
      compared to eligible and recruited patients.
PG  - 1176-81
LID - 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2008.02.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The recruitment process may generate a selected patient sample, which 
      may threaten the generalizability of trial results. This risk is particularly
      high in case disease and patient characteristics demonstrate a wide variation,
      such as in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We compared IBS patients who were
      selected, approached, and randomized to participate in a clinical trial assessing
      the efficacy of dietary fiber therapy in IBS. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Retrospective survey in primary care patients diagnosed with IBS by their general
      practitioner in the past 2 years selected and invited for participation in a
      trial. Characteristics were compared between randomized patients (n=193)
      nonrandomized eligible patients (n=371), and patients not eligible for
      participating in the trial (n=724). RESULTS: Of the 2,100 IBS patients, 1,288
      (61%) returned the questionnaire. Randomized patients had a higher intensity of
      IBS abdominal pain as compared to the other groups, a higher consultation rate
      and a longer IBS disease history. Noneligible patients had less active IBS
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized do differ from those nonrandomized in 
      IBS disease characteristics. These observations may have implications for the
      applicability of our research outcome.

TI  - [The efficacy of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease].
PG  - 1385-90
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host
      animals by improving its microbial balance. Probiotics have been used in the
      treatment of bacterial or viral induced acute intestinal infection. In recent
      years, some clinical studies have shown the therapeutic effects of probiotics in 
      the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or prevention of
      allergic disease. Evidence exists for therapeutic use of probiotics in acute
      infectious diarrhea, Clostridium difficile colitis and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Their exact role in IBD, irritable bowel syndrome and prevention of
      cancer has not to be determined. This review summarized the data about probiotics
      in gastrointestinal diseases and examine the mechanisms of action related to
      their therapeutic effects.

TI  - Melatonin for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - The enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract secrete 400 times
      as much melatonin as the pineal gland; therefore, it is not surprising that
      research is finding that this indole plays an important role in GI functioning.
      In animal studies, it protects against GI ulcerations, and randomized clinical
      trials suggest its efficacy in treating functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel 
      syndrome. Melatonin administration has been shown to protect against esophageal
      lesions in animals. Moreover, in a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of
      subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the combination of
      melatonin with other natural supplements was found to be superior to omeprazole, 
      a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Its administration as a single treatment for GERD 
      has not been previously reported. A 64-year-old Caucasian female who required
      treatment with a PPI for symptoms of GERD wished to substitute a natural
      treatment because of the risk of worsening her osteoporosis. She experienced a
      return of symptoms following each of three 20-day trials of a proprietary blend
      of D-limonene when attempts were made to discontinue the PPI. She then underwent 
      a trial of a natural formula consisting of melatonin 6 mg, 5-hydroxytryptophan
      100 mg, D,L-methionine 500 mg, betaine 100 mg, L-taurine 50 mg, riboflavin 1.7
      mg, vitamin B6 0.8 mg, folic acid 400 microg, and calcium 50 mg. After 40 days,
      the PPI was withdrawn without a return of symptoms. Subsequently, an attempt to
      reduce melatonin to 3 mg resulted in symptoms, while all other ingredients were
      withdrawn with minimal symptoms during 10 months of follow-up.

TI  - New insights into Lactobacillus and functional intestinal disorders.
PG  - 287-93
AB  - Intestinal microflora can be considered as a ''dynamic system'' that actively
      interacts with the intestinal epithelium and the local immune system. It
      synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), 
      it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a
      competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram
      variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be 
      ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to
      31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a 
      reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains
      (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the
      hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical
      findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may
      be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative 
      infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver
      transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically
      stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and
      in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead 
      to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria 
      and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact
      that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of
      Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for
      instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei
      subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new
      field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of
      safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in
      medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to
      validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli
      in the treatment of IBS.

TI  - 2008 Clinical approach to irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria,
      affects 10-20% of the general population, with women 20-40 years old accounting
      for the majority of patients. Although variable and intermittent, IBS symptoms
      may persist for many years. Repeated referrals for medical consultation and
      diagnostic studies generate huge healthcare costs. Since there is no evidence
      that IBS leads to more severe gastrointestinal disorders, in absence of alarm
      symptoms or signs, an invasive diagnostic algorithm is not indicated. Optimal
      treatment for IBS still needs to be defined. The clinical approach is based on
      treatment of the prevalent symptom. When pain predominates, antispasmodics are
      the first choice. In case of diarrhea, loperamide is useful for reducing bowel
      frequency. Soluble fiber represents the first option in subjects with IBS and
      constipation or mixed IBS. Dietary integrators composed of probiotics and
      serotonin precursors are a promising therapeutic option.

PG  - 184-91

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) experience similar symptoms; however, individuals with IBD
      have alterations in their digestive tract and an increased probability of
      developing colorectal cancer, whereas individuals with IBS do not. Although not
      well documented within the literature, individuals with gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders may engage in adverse behaviors regarding their intake of food,
      regardless of the fact that the "offending agents" have been identified. Further 
      study into these negative behaviors is warranted for healthcare professionals to 
      be provided with a better understanding of the behaviors that individuals with GI
      disorders knowingly engage in, despite the negative consequences. PURPOSE: The
      overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women
      diagnosed with the GI disorders IBD and/or IBS, with an emphasis on the dietary
      patterns of the women before and after diagnosis. Specifically, this article
      examines the adverse behaviors that women engaged in with respect to the
      consumption of food, beverages, and medications. METHODS: Eight women diagnosed
      with IBD or IBS were recruited from a university campus in southwestern Ontario, 
      Canada. Participants completed a background questionnaire, a 14-day food diary,
      and a semistructured interview consisting of 8 open-ended questions. RESULTS:
      Three major themes were identified: family and friend support, control, and
      adverse behaviors. The focus of this article, the theme of adverse behaviors,
      consisted of 2 major subthemes: dietary restrictions and issues with medication. 
      All women engaged in adverse behaviors regarding their food intake and/or
      consumption of medications as related to food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Semistructured
      interviews with women diagnosed with IBD and IBS revealed that all women felt
      governed by their bowels to varying degrees. In addition, all women within this
      sample knowingly engaged in behaviors concerning food/beverages that had the
      potential to be detrimental to their conditions. A myriad of reasons were given
      for consuming foods/beverages. Implications for nursing practitioners are
      discussed.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common conditions seen in
      primary care settings. Despite this, there is no consensus as to the pathogenesis
      of this disorder or a consistently effective therapeutic regimen for many
      patients. This has encouraged the use of various alternative therapies from
      behavioral or complementary medicine. This review will address the evidence for
      alternative therapies, including the following: cognitive behavior therapy,
      hypnosis, elimination diets based on food antibody testing, nutrition supplements
      (such as fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics), and, finally, peppermint,
      l-glutamine, zinc, and cromolyn sodium. The review also explores the evidence for
      and the therapeutic ramifications of the hypothesis that increased intestinal
      permeability underlies the symptoms of IBS in many patients, and how a
      therapeutic plan that addresses nutrition, elimination diets, and nutrition
      supplements may be useful in restoring the integrity of the gut immune barrier.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized 
      by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency
      and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care
      services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely 
      multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and
      dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their
      symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report
      menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management
      include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress
      reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain
      sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the
      pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current
      therapeutic approaches for symptom management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of the endogenous protein anti-secretory factor
      (ASF) on the symptoms, especially loose stools, in irritable bowel ayndrome
      (IBS). DESIGN: A diet with specially processed cereals (SPC) known to induce ASF 
      production was used in patients with IBS, in an eight-week randomized,
      placebo-controlled study. SUBJECTS: Eighty-two patients with IBS were randomized 
      to a diet with either SPC or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The overall clinical
      condition and the quality of life were measured by VAS and SF-36 questionnaire,
      respectively. The plasma levels of ASF were determined in 14 patients with
      dominating loose stools before and after diet. RESULTS: All patients
      significantly (p<0.001) improved in IBS-related symptoms irrespective of active
      or placebo diet. In an active-diet sub-group with diarrhoea (n=11) there was a
      significant (p<0.05) correlation between the increase of plasma ASF level and the
      improvement on the VAS. CONCLUSION: Both study groups improved significantly on
      the VAS but no additive effect was seen for the active treatment. In the
      sub-group with loose stools, the SPC diet induced ASF plasma levels in IBS
      patients and was correlated to significant symptom improvement in the individual 
      patient.

AB  - Therapy trials with bacterial compounds in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have
      produced conflicting results. This study was performed in 1988 and 1989, and was 
      re-analysed according to current IBS standards. Two hundred ninety-seven patients
      with lower abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the
      compound ProSymbioflor((R)) (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an autolysate
      of cells and cell fragments of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, or
      placebo in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients were seen weekly by the
      physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS symptoms. Responders had at
      least a 50% decrease in global symptom score (GSS) and in abdominal pain score
      (APS) reports at >/=1 visit during treatment. The responder rate in GSS to the
      drug was 102/149 (68.5%) in comparison to placebo with 56/148 (37.8%) (P <
      0.001), the improvement in APS was 108/149 (72.5%) and 66/148 (44.6%)
      respectively (P = 0.001). The number-needed-to-treat was 3.27 for GSS and 3.59
      for the APS report. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a mean response time of 4-5
      weeks for active treatment and more than 8 weeks for placebo (P < 0.0001).
      Treatment of IBS with the bacterial lysate ProSymbioflor is effective and
      superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients seen by general 
      practitioners.

AB  - The clear delineation of a postinfective variety of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), and the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade
      inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional
      relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly,
      provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes
      of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, 
      are also plausible. Although clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to
      emerge, a review of available trials emphasizes the importance of clear
      definition of strain selection, dose, and viability. The possible roles of
      cotherapy or sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or
      other agents, also deserve further study. The role of the enteric flora is
      evidently an area of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era
      of research and therapy for this common disorder.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use--2008.
PG  - S104-8
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31816b903f [doi]
AB  - Recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics were published after a Yale
      University Workshop in 2005. A similar workshop was held in 2007, and the
      recommendations were updated and extended into other areas. The recommendations
      are graded into an "A," "B," "C" or no category based on the expert's opinion and
      review by the workshop participants. An "A" recommendation is made for acute
      childhood diarrhea, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, preventing and 
      maintaining remission in pouchitis, and in an immune response for the treatment
      and prevention of atopic eczema associated with cow's milk allergy. The group
      maintained several "B" recommendations in other areas of treating inflammatory
      bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Although there are significant
      studies in the "B" group, most "B" recommendations did not reach an "A" level
      because of some negative studies or a limited number of studies. Many reports in 
      the "C" recommendations were significant but fell short of receiving stronger
      ratings because of the size of reported patient studies, and also the factors
      that limited categories to the "B" rating.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The human gut harbours a complex community of bacteria whose
      relationship with their host is normally mutually beneficial. Recent studies
      suggest a disturbance of this relationship in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 
      the potential to correct this using prebiotics and probiotics. AIM: To review the
      mechanisms of action of probiotics and prebiotics in IBS and to assess their
      performance in clinical trials. METHODS: Articles relating to modes of action and
      randomized control trials of treatment were reviewed by searching PubMed using
      terms 'probiotic', 'prebiotic' and 'irritable bowel'. Small uncontrolled studies 
      in IBS were excluded. RESULTS: Probiotics can enhance gut barrier function,
      inhibit pathogen binding and modulate gut inflammatory response. They can also
      reduce visceral hypersensitivity associated with both inflammation and
      psychological stress. Probiotics can alter colonic fermentation and stabilize the
      colonic microbiota. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled trials of
      adequate design have shown an improvement in flatulence and abdominal distension 
      with a reduction in composite IBS symptoms scores. CONCLUSIONS: Each probiotic
      has unique features and IBS patients are heterogeneous. Future efforts should be 
      directed to identifying biomarkers of responsiveness to facilitate better
      targeting of treatment and hence improved efficacy.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal
      pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a 
      disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore
      therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more
      recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI)
      microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of
      probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an
      upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the
      host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article 
      explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might
      lead to therapeutic benefit.

AB  - The eosinophil-mast cell-neural pathway may be important in the pathophysiology
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by unexplained abdominal
      pain, disordered defecation, or meal-related discomfort. There is evidence that
      duodenal eosinophils are increased in functional dyspepsia, whereas mast cells
      are increased in the lower gut in irritable bowel syndrome, directly supporting a
      role for a hypersensitivity-type reaction in these disorders. The trigger may be 
      a pathogen, food, or other allergen in the gut mucosa. This trigger may evoke
      eosinophils, mast cells, and other components to cascade to up-regulate serotonin
      release, with modulation of the enteric and central nervous systems, creating a
      vicious cycle. If correct, this theory suggests treatment should specifically
      target the eosinophil-mast cell pathway.

TI  - Cow's milk protein sensitivity assessed by the mucosal patch technique is related
      to irritable bowel syndrome in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome.
PG  - 929-35

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) are reported to have
      a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms partly attributed to an overrepresentation
      of celiac disease. We have observed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      symptoms are frequent complaints in this patient group. Allergic manifestations
      to various drugs are also common in pSS. A role of food allergy in IBS has been
      proposed. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the mucosal response to
      rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) in patients with pSS and relates
      possible CM reactivity to their intestinal symptoms. METHODS: A rectal challenge 
      with CM was performed in 21 patients with pSS and 18 healthy controls. Fifteen
      hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the release
      of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as signs of mucosal inflammatory reaction were measured 
      using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Eight out of 21 patients with pSS had
      a definite increase of mucosal NO synthesis and the luminal release of MPO after 
      rectal CM challenge. This sign of milk sensitivity was not linked to IgG/IgA
      antibodies to milk proteins. The symptoms for IBS according to Rome III criteria 
      were fulfilled in 13 patients. All patients who were CM sensitive suffered from
      IBS. In a small open study, patients reactive to CM reported an improvement of
      intestinal symptoms on a CM-free diet. CONCLUSION: A rectal mucosal inflammatory 
      response after CM challenge is seen in 38% of patients with pSS as a sign of CM
      sensitivity. IBS-like symptoms were common in pSS, linked to CM sensitivity.

AB  - We examined the association between serum trace elements and clinical findings
      such as number of sensitive tender points, severity of fatigue and functional
      status in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). Thirty-two patients diagnosed as
      having FM according to the ACR 1990 criteria and 32 normal healthy controls (NHC)
      were included in this study. The demographic data, disease duration, number of
      tender points and accompanying symptoms (fatigue, sleep disorders, headache,
      paresthesia, irritable bowel syndrome, sicca symptoms, Raynaud's phenomena) of
      the patients were noted. Visual analog scale (10 cm) was implemented to estimate 
      daily severity of pain and fatigue. Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire was used
      for functional assessment. Serum selenium (microg/dL) and serum zinc (microg/dL) 
      levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometer. Serum magnesium (mmol/L) 
      level was measured by the original kits of Abbott Aeroset auto-analyzer. The mean
      age of patients in FM group and NHC were calculated as 42.9 (SD = 7.7) years and 
      41.3 (SD = 9.7) years, respectively. Serum levels of zinc (P = 0.001) and
      magnesium (P = 0.002) were significantly decreased by FM groups, whereas there
      was no considerable difference with selenium levels of both groups (P > 0.05).
      Association between serum zinc level and number of tender points (P = 0.008) and 
      that between fatigue and magnesium level (P = 0.003) was found as meaningful.
      According to the results of this study, it was asserted that serum magnesium and 
      zinc levels may play an important role in the pathophysiology of FM.

TI  - Discrepancies between the responses to skin prick test to food and respiratory
      antigens in two subtypes of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 3044-8
AB  - AIM: To compare the response to skin prick tests (SPTs) to food antigens (FAs)
      and inhalant allergens (IAs) in patients with two subtypes of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and healthy controls. METHODS: We compared the results of SPTs for
      IAs and FAs in 87 volunteers divided into three groups: diarrhea predominant IBS 
      (D-IBS) Group I (n = 19), constipation predominant IBS (C-IBS) Group II (n = 17),
      and normal controls Group III (n = 51). RESULTS: Of the 285 tests (171 for FAs
      and 114 for IAs) performed in Group I we obtained 45 (26.3%) positive responses
      for FA and 23 (20.1%) for IA. Of the 153 tests for FA in Group II, we obtained 66
      (20.1%) positive responses, and of the 102 tests for IA, we obtained 20 (19.6%)
      positive responses. Of the 459 tests for FA performed in Group III, we obtained
      39 (84%) positive responses, and of the 306 for IA, we obtained 52 (16.9%)
      positive responses. The numbers of positive responses were not significantly
      different between the three groups, but in the D-IBS group, the number of SPT FA 
      responses differed significantly from those for the other two groups (P > 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of cases studied, the higher reactivity to
      FAs in Group I compared to Groups II and III adds new information, and suggests
      the presence of a possible alteration in intestinal epithelial function.

AB  - The authors conducted a well-designed, multinational, large study of women
      younger than 65 yr of age with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with a mixed
      pattern of diarrhea and constipation (IBS-M) or constipation (IBS-C) and showed
      that a statistically greater percentage of patients in each group responded to
      tegaserod compared with patients treated with placebo. Practicality looms large, 
      however, in that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) disallowed the continued 
      marketing of tegaserod because of cardiovascular safety concerns, and it now is
      only available under a restricted access program. The wisdom of this decision
      aside, it is disturbing that the FDA revealed a zero-tolerance for any
      significant risk of disease when a drug (e.g., tegaserod) was used for a
      nonlife-threatening condition; the FDA chose to neglect any potential benefit of 
      significant improvement in quality of life, while at the same time allowing the
      continued availability of sildenifil for erectile dysfunction and other
      medications (e.g., rosiglitazone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      [NSAIDs]), each with a far greater risk of cardiovascular complications. Whether 
      tegaserod will be re-released and, if so, under what conditions, is yet to be
      determined, as is the question of whether the FDA will decide to allow a more
      transparent decision-making process with input from all interested parties
      affected by their decision.

      randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 1775-80
LID - 10.1007/s10350-008-9335-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate whether probiotics improve symptoms 
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web
      of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for 
      studies that investigated the efficacy of probiotics in the management of
      irritable bowel syndrome. Clinical improvement was the key outcome of interest.
      Data were searched within the time period of 1966 through September 2007.
      RESULTS: Eight randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials met our criteria
      and were included in the analysis. Pooling of eight trials for the outcome of
      clinical improvement yielded a significant relative risk of 1.22 (95 percent
      confidence interval, 1.07-1.4; P = 0.0042). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may improve
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and can be used as supplement to standard
      therapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 2650-61
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition affecting 3%-25% of the
      general population. As no curative treatment is available, therapy is aimed at
      reducing symptoms, often with little success. Because alteration of the normal
      intestinal microflora has been observed in IBS, probiotics (beneficial microbes
      taken to improve health) may be useful in reducing symptoms. This paper
      systematically reviews randomized, controlled, blinded trials of probiotics for
      the treatment of IBS and synthesizes data on efficacy across trials of adequate
      quality. PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical trials,
      metaRegister, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
      searched from 1982-2007. We also conducted secondary searches of reference lists,
      reviews, commentaries, relevant articles on associated diseases, books and
      meeting abstracts. Twenty trials with 23 probiotic treatment arms and a total of 
      1404 subjects met inclusion criteria. Probiotic use was associated with
      improvement in global IBS symptoms compared to placebo [pooled relative risk (RR 
      pooled) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.62-0.94]. Probiotics were also
      associated with less abdominal pain compared to placebo [RR pooled = 0.78
      (0.69-0.88)]. Too few studies reported data on other IBS symptoms or on specific 
      probiotic strains to allow estimation of a pooled RR. While our analyses suggest 
      that probiotic use may be associated with improvement in IBS symptoms compared to
      placebo, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the
      methodological limitations of contributing studies. Probiotics warrant further
      study as a potential therapy for IBS.

TI  - Dietary triggers of abdominal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome:
      randomized placebo-controlled evidence.
PG  - 765-71

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Observational studies suggest dietary fructose restriction
      might lead to sustained symptomatic response in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and fructose malabsorption. The aims of this study were first to
      determine whether the efficacy of this dietary change is due to dietary fructose 
      restriction and second to define whether symptom relief was specific to free
      fructose or to poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general. METHODS: The
      double-blinded, randomized, quadruple arm, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial
      took place in the general community. The 25 patients who had responded to dietary
      change were provided all food, low in free fructose and fructans, for the
      duration of the study. Patients were randomly challenged by graded dose
      introduction of fructose, fructans, alone or in combination, or glucose taken as 
      drinks with meals for maximum test period of 2 weeks, with at least 10-day
      washout period between. For the main outcome measures, symptoms were monitored by
      daily diary entries and responses to a global symptom question. RESULTS: Seventy 
      percent of patients receiving fructose, 77% receiving fructans, and 79% receiving
      a mixture reported symptoms were not adequately controlled, compared with 14%
      receiving glucose (P < or = 0.002, McNemar test). Similarly, the severity of
      overall and individual symptoms was significantly and markedly less for glucose
      than other substances. Symptoms were induced in a dose-dependent manner and
      mimicked previous IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS and fructose
      malabsorption, dietary restriction of fructose and/or fructans is likely to be
      responsible for symptomatic improvement, suggesting efficacy is due to
      restriction of poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general.

TI  - State and trait anxiety and depression in patients affected by gastrointestinal
      diseases: psychometric evaluation of 1641 patients referred to an internal
      medicine outpatient setting.
PG  - 1063-9

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate state and trait form of anxiety and current depression in
      patients affected by gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: We studied 1641
      outpatients with gastrointestinal disorders, consecutively referred to our
      Internal Medicine outpatients from 1997 to 2005. State and trait anxiety were
      assessed by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Current depression was
      assessed by the Zung self-rating depression scale. RESULTS: Among patients, 1379 
      (84.1%) showed state anxiety, 1098 (67%) showed trait anxiety and 442 (27%)
      showed current depression. The number of gastrointestinal diseases was directly
      correlated to state anxiety (p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = 0.04). Females
      showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than males (p < 0.001). State
      anxiety was related to food allergies (p < 0.001), small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) (p = 0.001), Hp infection (p = 0.01) and ulcerative colitis in 
      active phase (p = 0.03). Trait anxiety was related to irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) (p < 0.001), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection (p = 0.001), food allergies
      (p = 0.001) and SIBO (p = 0.001). Current depression was related to IBS (p <
      0.001) and coeliac disease (p = 0.01), SIBO (p = 0.02). A predicted probability
      of 0.77 +/- 0.16 to have state anxiety, of 0.66 +/- 0.12 to have trait anxiety
      and of 0.39 +/- 0.14 to have depression was found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      Most of the patients who seek medical consultation for gastrointestinal problems 
      show an associated affective disorder. These patients should be managed by a team
      including gastroenterologists, psychologists and/or psychiatrists, or by a
      gastroenterologist having expertise in the treatment of psychological disorders.

PG  - 1129-43
LID - 10.1517/14656566.9.7.1129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder that is associated with
      a significant impact on both affected individuals and society. While the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome remains unknown, knowledge regarding 
      the normal and abnormal functions of the gut and its complex interactions with
      the body's nervous systems continue to shed light on the multifactiorial origins 
      of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an
      overview of the current knowledge on the therapeutic approaches to irritable
      bowel syndrome. METHODS: A search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE
      and EMBASE was performed in order to identify all relevant articles published
      between 1980 and 2008. The search was enhanced with the use of a medical
      librarian. Bibliographies from potentially relevant articles were manually
      searched. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic options for irritable bowel
      syndrome are rapidly evolving beyond traditional symptom-based therapies, such as
      fiber, antispasmodics, antidiarrheals and laxatives and are moving towards agents
      with organ-specific receptor selectivity directed, in many cases, at specific
      gastrointestinal functions.

      affecting patient care.
PG  - 815-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2008.01818.x [doi]
AB  - Several high-profile drug withdrawals for safety issues have brought into focus
      the FDA's process for approving drugs and monitoring adverse experiences with
      those agents after marketing has begun. Gastroenterologists and their patients
      have been affected adversely by removal from the marketplace of two licensed
      agents for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): alosetron and tegaserod. The criteria 
      used by the FDA for assessment of the risks and benefits of drugs used for
      functional bowel problems seem to be different than those used for the treatment 
      of other conditions and have resulted in drastic limitation of access to these
      drugs rather than just warnings about risks as they are discovered. Decisions
      that affect the availability of drugs for patients with functional bowel disease 
      should be discussed with clinicians who take care of those patients before going 
      into effect. The absence of this sort of consultation leaves physicians with
      serious limitations on their abilities to take care of patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic 
      combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      We investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four
      strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of IBS. One hundred and sixteen
      patients with IBS fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized in a parallel
      group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x
      10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. The symptoms that were monitored weekly
      included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. Quality of 
      life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the SF36 and
      FDD-quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred subjects completed the
      study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). The probiotic combination was not
      superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS (42.6 versus 42.3%
      improvement). However, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the
      fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients
      (-41.9 versus -24.2%, P=0.048). Interesting findings from the IBS sub-groups were
      also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with
      alternating bowel habits (P=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the
      constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (P=0.043).
      CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the
      placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS. Despite the apparent high placebo response,
      interesting findings from IBS sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal 
      pain and stool frequency.

TI  - Effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 496-505
LID - 10.1592/phco.28.4.496 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the use of tegaserod and alosetron -- drugs approved for the treatment 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -- has been restricted because of adverse
      events. This has resulted in a need for additional modalities for the treatment
      of IBS. Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of probiotics in the
      global relief of symptoms associated with IBS and in the improvement of
      flatulence, abdominal pain, transit time, and bacterial counts. Using the MEDLINE
      database from 1966-October 2007 and manually searching article references for
      relevant articles and abstracts, we identified 14 blinded, placebo-controlled
      clinical trials of the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of IBS. Of 11
      studies in which overall symptom relief was assessed, seven indicated a
      significant improvement with probiotics versus placebo. Five of eight
      investigations of abdominal pain and distention revealed a benefit with probiotic
      use. Four studies demonstrated an improvement in symptomatic flatulence in
      probiotic treatment groups, whereas one study showed no significant benefit. Four
      of five studies of the effects of probiotics on colonic transit time revealed a
      benefit compared with placebo. As probiotics have shown benefit and possess a
      favorable adverse-effect profile, their use may represent an option for symptom
      relief in patients with IBS. However, additional data are necessary before
      probiotics can become a standard of care in the treatment of IBS, a complex and
      chronic condition.

TI  - Melatonin and serotonin effects on gastrointestinal motility.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract represents the most important extra pineal source of
      melatonin. Presence of melatonin (M) suggests that this hormone is somehow
      involved in digestive pathophysiology. Release of GI melatonin from
      serotonin-rich enterochromaffin EC cells of the GI mucosa suggest close
      antagonistic relationship with serotonin (S) and seem to be related to
      periodicity of food intake. Food deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue
      and plasma concentrations of M. Its also act as an autocrine and paracrine
      hormone affecting not only epithelium and immune system but also smooth muscle of
      the digestive tract. Low doses M improve gastrointestinal transit and affect MMC.
      M reinforce MMCs cyclic pattern but inhibits spiking bowel activity.
      Pharmacological doses of M delay gastric emptying via mechanisms that involve
      CCK2 and 5HT3 receptors. M released in response to lipid infusion exerts a
      modulatory influence that decreases the inhibitory effects of the ileal brake on 
      gastric emptying. On isolated bowel S induces dose dependent increase in tone and
      reduction in amplitude of contraction which is affected by M. M reduced the tone 
      but not amplitude or frequency of contraction. M is a promising therapeutic agent
      for IBS with activities independent of its effects on sleep, anxiety or
      depression. Since of its unique properties M could be considered for prevention
      or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers and
      irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has increased over the last 50
      years in countries where a Western-style diet has been prominent or introduced
      and 20 - 65 % of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their
      symptoms to something in food that activates an abnormal response. However, data 
      from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although
      investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete
      review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre
      diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there
      appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this
      subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but
      dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear
      that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and
      probiotics in these areas.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released after food intake to act as an
      incretin. GLP-1 also inhibits gastric emptying and increases satiety. In rats,
      GLP-1 inhibits small bowel motility. Our aim was to study the effects of GLP-1 on
      gastrointestinal motility in healthy subjects and patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Antro-duodeno-jejunal manometry was carried out during a 4-h
      control period with saline, followed by a 4-h period with intravenous GLP-1
      (healthy: 0.7 and 1.2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 16); IBS, 1.2 and 2.5 pmol kg(-1) 
      min(-1) (n = 14). Plasma was analysed for GLP-1 and gut hormones, and gut tissue 
      expression of GLP-1 receptor was studied. In healthy subjects, GLP-1 0.7 pmol
      kg(-1) min(-1) reduced the migrating motor complexes (MMCs) from a median of 2
      (range 2-3) to 0.5 (0-2), and motility index from 4.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 ln
      Sigma(mmHg*s min(-1)) in jejunum, while GLP-1 1.2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) diminished 
      MMCs from 2 (2-3) to 1.5 (1-2.5), and motility index from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 4.4 +/- 
      0.2. In IBS patients, GLP-1 1.2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) reduced the MMCs from 2.5
      (2-3.5) to 1 (0-1.5) without affecting motility index. At 2.5 pmol kg(-1) min(-1)
      GLP-1 decreased MMCs from 2 (1.5-3) to 1 (0.5-1.5), and motility index from 5.2
      +/- 0.2 to 4.0 +/- 0.5. Motility responses to GLP-1 were similar in antrum and
      duodenum. Presence of the GLP-1 receptor in the gut was verified by reverse
      transcriptase PCR. In conclusion, the gut peptide GLP-1 decreases motility in the
      antro-duodeno-jejunal region and inhibits the MMC in healthy subjects and IBS
      patients.

PG  - 741-51

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renewed interest in the use of antibiotics to prevent travellers'
      diarrhoea has occurred with the availability of non-absorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin,
      and with evidence that a subgroup of travellers with diarrhoea have progression
      of their illnesses to postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To summarize 
      recently published information and make recommendations on travellers' diarrhoea 
      prevention. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed on 2 January 2008 for 255 articles on
      the topic of 'travellers diarrhoea' published beginning with 2000 along with the 
      author's extensive file on prevention of travellers' diarrhoea. RESULTS:
      Exercising care in food and beverage selection, while of unproven value, is
      recommended during travel to high-risk areas of Latin America, Southern Asia or
      Africa. An algorithm is presented to identify future travellers, for which
      chemoprophylaxis is appropriate. The preferred drug for prevention of travellers'
      diarrhoea is rifaximin, with bismuth subsalicylate or a fluoroquinolone also
      being effective. Vaccines against the principal cause of travellers' diarrhoea,
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, are being developed. CONCLUSIONS: Research is
      needed to determine the relative effectiveness of exercising care on food and
      beverage selection and chemoprophylaxis in preventing travellers' diarrhoea and
      postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome during high-risk travel. Enterotoxigenic 
      E. coli vaccines appear to be a promising addition to travel medicine.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria exhibit a variety of properties, which are unique to a

      isolated from Korean infants' feces. The potential utility of Lactobacillus
      acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was studied. Forty
      IBS patients were randomized into a placebo (n = 20) and probiotics group (n =
      20). Four weeks of treatment with L. acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 was associated
      with a reduced score for abdominal pain or discomfort compared to the baseline (P
      = 0.011). The percent reduction in abdominal pain or discomfort exceeded the
      placebo scores by more than 20% (23.8 and 0.2% for probiotics and placebo,
      respectively, P = 0.003). There was a significant difference in the proportion of
      responders between the probiotics and placebo groups (P = 0.011). There was no
      drop out or adverse events for either group during the study period.
      Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 appeared to have a beneficial effect in 
      patients with IBS. Further studies are warranted.

      with allergic manifestations.
PG  - 49-53
LID - 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60404-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mast cells have a primary role in atopy. Mast cells may play a unique
      role in a subgroup of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This
      observation suggests a link between atopic disorders and IBS. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine whether there is an association between atopic disorders and IBS.
      METHODS: We undertook a prospective study using structured questionnaires. We
      administered questionnaires to 125 consecutive patients seen in the following
      clinics from July 1 through October 31, 2001: allergy/immunology (AI) (n = 39),
      gastroenterology (n = 36), and general medicine (n = 50). The survey included
      questions detailing gastrointestinal and allergic symptoms. Diagnosis of IBS was 
      based on Rome II criteria. Diagnosis of atopy was based on clinical parameters.
      RESULTS: The AI clinic reported a significantly (P = .015) higher rate of IBS
      than the general medicine clinic. The IBS incidence reported in the AI clinic was
      similar to that reported in the gastroenterology clinic. The likelihood of IBS
      was significantly higher in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (2.67 times;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-6.49; P = .03), patients with allergic eczema 
      (3.85 times; 95% CI, 1.72-8.60; P = .001), and patients with depression (2.56
      times; 95% CI, 1.05-6.14; P = .04). Patients reporting atopic symptoms (seasonal 
      allergic rhinitis, allergic eczema, and asthma) were 3.20 times (95% CI,
      1.20-8.50) (P = .02) more likely to fulfill the criteria for IBS. CONCLUSIONS:
      Adults with atopic symptoms report a high incidence of IBS, suggesting a link
      between atopy and IBS. We proposed a subgroup of patients with IBS (atopic IBS)
      who have typical IBS symptoms in association with atopic manifestations.
      Identifying atopic vs nonatopic IBS may help in identifyingthe underlying
      pathophysiologic mechanisms and therapeutic options.

LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003019.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies 
      for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on 
      physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed 
      by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions 
      for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE
      (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO 
      (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and
      JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were
      employed. In addition, researchers working in this area were asked to identify
      relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of
      any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with 
      a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II
      criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials
      for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies
      were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were
      included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre
      supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one
      study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled
      odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.16 (95% CI
      0.45-2.87). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983)
      compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a
      form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to 
      follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three
      trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation
      with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two
      (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided
      analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% 
      CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on
      the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that
      fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are
      effective in the management of children with RAP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found
      on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are managed by
      reassurance and simple measures, a large range of psychosocial interventions
      including cognitive and behavioural treatments and family therapy have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of psychosocial
      interventions for recurrent abdominal pain or IBS in school-age children. SEARCH 
      STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec
      2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2006), ERIC (1966 to Dec
      2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to
      March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched with appropriate filters. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Any study in which the majority of participants were
      school-age children fulfilling standard criteria for RAP (Apley or the Rome II
      criteria for functional gastrointestinal diseases) , randomly allocated to any
      psychosocial treatment compared to standard care or waiting list, were selected. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: References identified by the searches were
      independently screened against the inclusion criteria by two reviewers. Data were
      extracted and analysed using RevMan 4.2.10. MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised trials
      (including a total of 167 participants) of cognitive behavioural interventions
      were identified, with data reported in ten papers. Five studies reported
      statistically significant improvements in pain, measured in a variety of ways, in
      children randomised to receive interventions based on cognitive behavioural
      therapy compared to children on wait lists or receiving standard medical care
      (Duarte 2006; Humphreys 1998; Robins 2005; Sanders 1989; Sanders 1994). The
      remaining trial (Hicks 2003) included a wider group of children with recurrent
      pain and too few with only RAP to provide interpretable data. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: The included trials were small, with methodological weaknesses and a
      number failed to give appropriate detail regarding numbers of children assessed. 
      In spite of these methodological weaknesses and the clinical heterogeneity, the
      consistency and magnitude of the effects reported provides some evidence that
      cognitive behavioural therapy may be a useful intervention for children with
      recurrent abdominal pain although most children, particularly in primary care,
      will improve with reassurance and time.

TI  - Probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: an immunomodulatory strategy?
PG  - 684S-90S
AB  - The clear delineation of a post-infective variety of IBS, as well as the
      description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade inflammation and
      immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional relationship between
      the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly, provide a clear
      rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes of action,
      including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also
      plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to emerge, a
      review of available trials emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of
      strain selection, dose and viability. The possible roles of co-therapy or
      sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or other agents
      also deserves further study. The role of the enteric flora is evidently an area
      of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era of research and
      therapy for this common disorder.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria are used to treat or prevent a broad range of human diseases, 
      conditions, and syndromes. In addition, there are areas of medical use that have 
      been proposed for future probiotic applications. Randomized double-blind studies 
      have provided evidence of probiotic effectiveness for the treatment and
      prevention of acute diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, as well as for the 
      prevention of cow milk-induced food allergy in infants and young children.
      Research studies have also provided evidence of effectiveness for the prevention 
      of traveler's diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile-induced colitis, and
      urinary tract infections. There are also studies indicating that probiotics may
      be useful for prevention of respiratory infections in children, dental caries,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Areas of future
      interest for the application of probiotics include colon and bladder cancers,
      diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The probiotics with the greatest number of
      proven benefits are Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and Saccharomyces
      boulardii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects
      for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND 
      METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in
      gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases.
      RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular
      probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
      rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for
      irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's
      disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these
      patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies
      that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required.
      The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human
      trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation
      of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may
      have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the
      functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select
      disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed
      placebo-controlled studies.

TI  - Gorillas are a host for Dientamoeba fragilis: an update on the life cycle and
      host distribution.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - Dientamoeba fragilis is a gastrointestinal protozoan that has a worldwide
      distribution and is emergeing as a common cause of diarrhea. As D. fragilis has a
      propensity to cause chronic illness with symptoms similar to irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) it is not surprising that some patients with D. fragilis are
      misdiagnosed as having IBS. In contrast to most other pathogenic protozoa very
      little is known about its life cycle, epidemiology and mode of transmission. What
      role animal reservoirs play in the transmission of this parasite is unknown.
      Consequently we undertook a prospective study to determine the host distribution 
      of D. fragilis. Over a 2-year-period, 608 faecal samples from a wide range of
      animal and bird species, including pigs and other food species, were screened
      using permanent stained smears for the presence of D. fragilis. Trophozoites of
      D. fragilis were only detected in Western lowland gorillas (3/10) (Gorilla g.
      gorilla) and confirmed by PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The limited host range
      detected suggests human infection may not involve transmission from other animal 
      species. In addition, we provide an update on the limited knowledge about the
      life cycle of this parasite and its host distribution.

TI  - [Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917
      (EcN): a retrospective survey].
PG  - 888-92
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In many patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one
      symptom is predominant (e.g., diarrhea, constipation, meteorism, or alternating
      stool consistency). For IBS therapy, probiotic drugs such as Mutaflor (active
      ingredient: Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 [EcN]) are also being used. A
      systematic survey on the efficacy and safety of EcN in different IBS subgroups is
      still missing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a gastroenterologic outpatient practice, 
      results of 150 IBS patients treated with EcN were evaluated retrospectively. Most
      IBS patients enrolled belonged to the subgroups "diarrhea", "meteorism", and
      "alternating stool consistency". RESULTS: Regarding the diarrhea subgroup, not
      only a statistically significant improvement in stool frequency was observed, but
      also a marked improvement in concomitant symptoms such as abnormal urge,
      flatulence, and abdominal fullness. These complaints improved under EcN therapy
      in the other IBS subgroups as well, so that efficacy was assessed as "good to
      very good" in 73.4% of all cases. Tolerance to treatment was "good to very good" 
      in 97.9% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The results point to the possibility of EcN
      being a therapeutic option for patients of various IBS subgroups which is almost 
      free of side effects.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of colonic disorders.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended
      for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including
      diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have 
      been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
      colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should 
      we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or
      strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics
      have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some 
      coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain
      diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as
      well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to
      mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately
      designed trials are needed.

TI  - The role of probiotics in management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 393-400
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects a significant proportion of the North
      American population; however, the etiology and pathophysiology of this disease
      remain poorly understood, and treatment is focused on symptom management. Over
      the years, research has revealed that the bacterial flora in the human gut
      interact with the bowel in a complex and dynamic relationship and may be
      responsible for the induction and progression of some of the pathophysiologic
      aspects of IBS. Probiotics are nonpathogenic bacteria that benefit the host, and 
      the roles they can play in the bacterio-gut relationship provide hope of a safe
      treatment that would allow for modulation of IBS disease states. Probiotic
      treatment for IBS has undergone significant exploration, yet the exact
      therapeutic effects and doses of these beneficial bacteria remain unclear due to 
      the conflicting nature of available evidence. This review discusses the evidence 
      from randomized controlled trials on probiotic treatment of IBS and presents the 
      current understanding of the mechanisms of action of probiotics as they apply to 
      IBS and provides a plausible explanation for the variability in evidence
      documented by the various trials under review.

TI  - Risk factors for chronic constipation and a possible role of analgesics.
PG  - 905-11
AB  - Constipation has an estimated prevalence of 15% in the general population.
      However, the etiopathogenesis of this condition remains relatively obscure. This 
      study sought to identify potentially novel risk factors for chronic constipation.
      A valid self-report questionnaire was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified
      random sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents aged 30-64 years. A logistic
      regression model that adjusted for age, gender and somatic symptom score (SSC)
      was used to identify factors associated with chronic constipation. People
      reporting symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were excluded. Of the 892
      eligible subjects, 653 (73%) returned the survey. Among the 523 subjects not
      reporting IBS symptoms, chronic constipation was reported by 93 (18%) of the
      respondents. Chronic constipation was significantly associated with use of
      acetaminophen [>or=7 tablets per week, OR = 2.7 (1.1-6.6)]; aspirin [OR = 1.7
      (1.0-2.7)]; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [OR = 1.8 (1.1-3.0)]; and SSC. 
      No association was detected for age, gender, body mass index, marital status,
      smoking, alcohol, coffee, education level, food allergy, exposure to pets,
      stress, emotional support, or water supply. Chronic constipation is associated
      with use of acetaminophen, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The
      explanation of these associations requires further investigation.

TI  - [The therapeutic effects of eliminating allergic foods according to food-specific
      IgG antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 641-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      by eliminating the allergic foods according to food-specific IgG antibodies and
      to clarify the etiopathological role and mechanism of food allergy. METHODS: The 
      food-specific IgG antibodies to a panel of 14 different food antigens in serum
      were detected with ELISA in fifty five cases with diarrhea-dominant IBS, thirty
      two with constipation-dominant IBS and eighteen normal controls. The frequency
      and severity index of symptoms and scores of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of 
      Life (IBS-QOL) in thirty five cases with positive food-specific IgG were observed
      before and after elimination of allergic foods for two months. RESULTS: The
      positive rate of serum food-specific IgG antibodies was 63.6 percent in patients 
      with diarrhea-dominant IBS and 43.8 percent in constipation-dominant IBS. Both
      were higher than that in normal controls. After eliminating allergic foods for
      four weeks according to the levels of serum food-specific IgG antibodies, the
      frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79 +/- 1.58) to (1.67 +/- 0.70) per week 
      and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.52 +/- 0.67 with significant
      differences. After eight weeks, the frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79
      +/- 1.58) to (1.53 +/- 0.69) per week and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.45
      +/- 0.66, also with significant differences. After eliminating allergic foods,
      the overall health score and the eight dimensionality integrals of QOL except
      avoiding food in patients with IBS increased significantly than those before
      treatment. At the end of eight weeks, the symptoms relieved completely in 31.4
      percent of the cases and remarkably in 34.3 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal immune
      reactions mediated by IgG antibodies coexisted in patients with IBS. It is of
      great significance in treating IBS by eliminating the allergic foods according to
      the serum level of food-specific IgG antibodies.

TI  - Review article: lactose intolerance in clinical practice--myths and realities.
PG  - 93-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of the world population has hypolactasia, which
      often remains undiagnosed and has the potential to cause some morbidity. However,
      not everyone has lactose intolerance, as several nutritional and genetic factors 
      influence tolerance. AIMS: To review current clinical practice and identify
      published literature on the management of lactose intolerance. METHODS: PubMed
      was searched using the terms lactose, lactase and diet to find original research 
      and reviews. Relevant articles and clinical experience provided the basis for
      this review. RESULTS: Lactose is found only in mammalian milk and is hydrolysed
      by lactase in the small intestine. The lactase gene has recently been identified.
      'Wild-type' is characterized by lactase nonpersistence, often leading to lactose 
      intolerance. Two genetic polymorphisms responsible for persistence have been
      identified, with their distribution concentrated in north Europeans. Symptoms of 
      lactose intolerance include abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea.
      Diagnosis is most commonly by the lactose hydrogen breath test. However, most
      people with hypolactasia, if given appropriate advice, can tolerate some
      lactose-containing foods without symptoms. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, some
      people with lactose intolerance can consume milk and dairy foods without
      developing symptoms, whereas others will need lactose restriction.

TI  - Bacteria: a new player in gastrointestinal motility disorders--infections,
      bacterial overgrowth, and probiotics.
PG  - 735-48, xi
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may result from a dysfunctional interaction
      between the indigenous flora and the intestinal mucosa, which in turn leads to
      immune activation in the colonic mucosa. Some propose that bacterial overgrowth
      is a common causative factor in the pathogenesis of symptoms in IBS; others point
      to evidence suggesting that the cause stems from more subtle qualitative changes 
      in the colonic flora. Bacterial overgrowth will probably prove not to be a major 
      factor in what will eventually be defined as IBS. Nevertheless, short-term
      therapy with either antibiotics or probiotics seems to reduce symptoms among IBS 
      patients. However, in the long term, safety issues will favor the probiotic
      approach; results of long-term studies with these agents are eagerly awaited.

TI  - Constipation: evaluation and treatment of colonic and anorectal motility
      disorders.
PG  - 687-711, x
AB  - This article focuses on the colonic and anorectal motility disturbances that are 
      associated with chronic constipation and their management. Functional chronic
      constipation consists of three overlapping subtypes: slow transit constipation,
      dyssynergic defecation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The Rome 
      criteria may serve as a useful guide for making a clinical diagnosis of
      functional constipation. Today, an evidence-based approach can be used to treat
      patients with chronic constipation. The availability of specific drugs for the
      treatment of chronic constipation, such as tegaserod and lubiprostone, has
      enhanced the therapeutic armamentarium for managing these patients. Randomized
      controlled trials have also established the efficacy of biofeedback therapy in
      the treatment of dyssynergic defecation.

TI  - Effects of symbiotic preparations on constipated irritable bowel syndrome
      symptoms.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies that are being
      used to treat different gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel
      syndrome, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. AIMS: Evaluating 
      the effects of a symbiotic preparation on symptoms and colonic transit in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and significant bloating. METHODS: We
      carried out an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter trial on 129
      patients meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome who did not have
      lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing
      psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse. For three months, the patients were
      treated with a symbiotic preparation and were investigated trough questionnaires 
      on symptoms. Data on bloating and abdominal pain were obtained using the
      McNemar-Bowker's test, while data on stool frequency were evaluated using the
      t-test. RESULTS: The administration of a symbiotic preparation to these patients 
      modified the clinical picture and intestinal function, with a significant
      increase of stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, although the study had an
      open design, represent a further analysis of positive symbiotic effects on
      clinical manifestations and intestinal function in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome.

TI  - Clinical trial: multispecies probiotic supplementation alleviates the symptoms of
      irritable bowel syndrome and stabilizes intestinal microbiota.
PG  - 48-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common diagnosis in
      gastroenterology. Trials suggest certain probiotics to be beneficial. AIM: To
      investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii
      JS and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality 
      of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel
      syndrome. METHODS: Eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (Rome II
      criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month
      intervention. Patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies
      probiotic supplementation or placebo. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality 
      of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum
      cytokines and sensitive C-reactive protein were monitored. RESULTS: The composite
      irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% CI: -19
      to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% CI: -8
      to 1) with placebo (P = 0.0083). Especially, distension and abdominal pain were
      affected. A stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota
      similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1),
      while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). No differences were seen in
      C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: This multispecies probiotic seems to be an
      effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and 
      to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Probiotic agents in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 583-9
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by abdominal pain and alterations
      in bowel habits. Several pathogenetic factors, such as altered intestinal
      motility, visceral hypersensitivity, serotonin system abnormalities and psychic
      disturbances have been identified. Recently, a pathogenetic role of intestinal
      microflora has been shown in IBS: viral or bacterial infection can trigger
      post-infectious IBS; some patients have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth;
      the composition of patients' enteric flora is altered; and minimal inflammatory
      changes, consistent with the pro-inflammatory role of bacteria, have been
      demonstrated. Probiotics may, therefore, offer a rational therapeutic approach to
      IBS. The data available on the use of probiotics in IBS are still limited and
      results of controlled clinical trials are contradictory because they have been
      performed using different species, dosages, treatment durations and end-points
      for results evaluation. A critical evaluation of the therapeutic role of the
      various probiotics in IBS is presented in this article.

TI  - Why do subjects with irritable bowel syndrome seek health care for their
      symptoms?
PG  - 1194-203
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the population, but not
      all subjects seek professional health care for their symptoms. The aim of this
      study was to compare consulters in secondary/tertiary care with those in primary 
      care and non-consulters by using questionnaires to investigate factors of
      importance for health-care seeking in IBS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study
      included 218 subjects with IBS: 70 non-consulters, 53 patients from primary care 
      and 95 from secondary/tertiary care. The subjects completed questionnaires on
      gastrointestinal (GI) and psychological symptoms, coping resources,
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reasons for not seeking health care.
      RESULTS: Consulters (primary and secondary/tertiary care combined) had poorer
      HRQOL, more severe psychological symptoms, higher levels of GI-specific anxiety
      and poor coping resources compared with non-consulters, but the GI symptom
      severity was similar. Mental health and poor social, emotional and physical
      functioning were independently predictive of being a health-care seeker (r
      (2)=0.41). Independent predictors for being a consulter in secondary/tertiary
      care were a high degree of anxiety, low scores on physical functioning, physical 
      role and food (IBSQOL) (r (2)=0.65). Several non-consulters reported mild
      symptoms and ability to control symptoms as reasons for not seeking health care. 
      Having a close relative with similar symptoms reduced the need to seek health
      care. Thirty-six non-consulters had sought alternative care or advice from
      friends and/or relatives about their GI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptom
      severity alone cannot explain the illness behavior in IBS. HRQOL and
      psychological symptoms are important for experience of GI symptoms and the
      health-care seeking pattern in IBS.

TI  - Almost all irritable bowel syndromes are post-infectious and respond to
      probiotics: consensus issues.
PG  - 241-4
AB  - Several reports have described post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (Pi-IBS),
      while many animal and human studies have shown the presence of increased
      infiltration of inflammatory cells and hyperplasia of enterochromaffin cells in
      the intestinal mucosa after acute gastroenteritis. The potential value of
      probiotic bacteria in restoring normal gut function has been demonstrated by
      animal models of Pi-IBS. In humans, Pi-IBS can be prevented utilizing probiotics 
      to reduce the duration of acute gastroenteritis, despite the variable efficacy
      shown in randomized control trials evaluating unspecified IBS. Here, advances in 
      the pathophysiology supporting the post-infectious hypothesis are considered. In 
      addition, the current role of probiotics in the management of Pi-IBS is
      discussed.

TI  - Fiber and colorectal diseases: separating fact from fiction.
PG  - 4161-7
AB  - Whilst fruits and vegetables are an essential part of our dietary intake, the
      role of fiber in the prevention of colorectal diseases remains controversial. The
      main feature of a high-fiber diet is its poor digestibility. Soluble fiber like
      pectins, guar and ispaghula produce viscous solutions in the gastrointestinal
      tract delaying small bowel absorption and transit. Insoluble fiber, on the other 
      hand, pass largely unaltered through the gut. The more fiber is ingested, the
      more stools will have to be passed. Fermentation in the intestines results in
      build up of large amounts of gases in the colon. This article reviews the
      physiology of ingestion of fiber and defecation. It also looks into the impact of
      dietary fiber on various colorectal diseases. A strong case cannot be made for a 
      protective effect of dietary fiber against colorectal polyp or cancer. Neither
      has fiber been found to be useful in chronic constipation and irritable bowel
      syndrome. It is also not useful in the treatment of perianal conditions. The
      fiber deficit - diverticulosis theory should also be challenged. The authors urge
      clinicians to keep an open mind about fiber. One must be aware of the truths and 
      myths about fiber before recommending it.

TI  - Prescript-assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: an
      open-label, partially controlled, 1-year extension of a previously published
      controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1153-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to extend a previous 2-week assessment of a 
      probiotic-prebiotic complex in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      METHODS: In this open-label, partially controlled, 1-year (14 [2] months)
      extension study, data were collected from patients with IBS who continued
      treatment following a 2-week study of the efficacy of the probiotic-prebiotic
      complex. Data were collected at 2 and approximately 60 weeks after the end of the
      original study. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients entered the 2-week extension and 
      22 completed the approximately 60-week follow-up study (20 women, 2 men; age
      range, 20-70 years; all white). Results in the control group 2 weeks after
      crossover to treatment were similar to those from the original study, with
      reductions in IBS subsyndromes, as follows: general ill feelings/nausea (P <
      0.001), indigestion/flatulence (P < 0.001), and marginally colitis (P < 0.03
      [1-tailed]). Treatment was associated with a continued reduction in general ill
      feelings/nausea at 4 weeks (P < 0.007). At >or=52-week follow-up, the rate of
      remissions was 81.5% to 100% (P < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Based on the results from
      the present 1-year extension study, treatment with this probiotic-prebiotic
      complex may be an option for short-term (2-4 weeks) and long-term ( approximately
      60-week) reductions in IBS symptoms.

TI  - Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome: a long-term consequence of bacterial
      gastroenteritis.
PG  - 1762-9
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a commonly diagnosed disease characterized by
      gastrointestinal symptoms that may be associated with psychological illness and
      emotional problems. The prevalence rate worldwide for IBS ranges from 10 to 20%
      and is higher for women than for men. IBS imposes a substantial financial burden 
      on both patients and employers because of increased medical costs and decreased
      work productivity. Recent studies indicate that inflammatory processes involving 
      the gastrointestinal tract are strongly correlated with IBS. Acute bacterial
      gastroenteritis has been linked with the onset of symptoms in approximately 15%
      of patients diagnosed with IBS; these cases have been called postinfectious IBS. 
      Organisms commonly associated with postinfectious IBS include the foodborne
      pathogens Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella. The
      pathologic changes associated with postinfectious IBS are likely due to
      inflammatory reactions induced by the infecting organisms. Postinfectious IBS
      should be recognized as a potential long-term consequence of foodborne
      gastroenteritis.

TI  - Current and future uses of real-time polymerase chain reaction and microarrays in
      the study of intestinal microbiota, and probiotic use and effectiveness.
PG  - 537-50
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the
      host when administered in adequate amounts. In addition to human health benefits,
      probiotics can improve various aspects of growth and performance in livestock and
      poultry, as well as control undesirable microorganisms in food animals. Studies
      indicate that probiotics can prevent or treat certain conditions, including
      atopic disease in infants, food allergy, infection after surgery, acute diarrhea,
      and symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding the complete
      mechanism, effectiveness, and potential use of probiotics is limited by the
      availability and sensitivity of current methods (i.e., culturing techniques). In 
      recent years, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays have
      become prominent and promising methods to examine quantitative changes of
      specific members of the microbial community and the influence of probiotics on
      the structure and function of human and animal intestinal ecosystems.
      Culture-independent studies have established that only a fraction of organisms
      present in feces are cultivable, therefore, results obtained by cultivation are
      limited. Conversely, in-depth knowledge of microbial genomes has enabled
      real-time PCR and microarrays to be more sensitive and has resulted in precise
      methods for comprehensive analysis of the complex gut microbiota. Additionally,
      these technologies can assess the influence of intestinal microorganisms on host 
      metabolism, nutrient status, and disease. This paper reviews method technologies 
      and applications of real-time PCR and microarray assays as they relate to the
      effect and use of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal
      disease.

TI  - Psychological burden of food allergy.
PG  - 3456-65
AB  - One fifth of the population report adverse reactions to food. Reasons for these
      symptoms are heterogeneous, varying from food allergy, food intolerance,
      irritable bowel syndrome to somatoform or other mental disorders. Literature
      reveals a large discrepancy between truly diagnosed food allergy and reports of
      food allergy symptoms by care seekers. In most studies currently available the
      characterization of patient groups is incomplete, because they did not
      distinguish between immunologic reactions and other kinds of food reactions. In
      analysing these adverse reactions, a thorough physical and psychological
      diagnostic approach is important. In our qualitative review, we present those
      diagnostic measures that are evidence-based as well as clinically useful, and
      discuss the various psychological dimensions of adverse reactions to food. It is 
      important to acknowledge the complex interplay between body and mind: Adults and 
      children suffering from food allergy show impaired quality of life and a higher
      level of stress and anxiety. Pavlovian conditioning of adverse reactions plays an
      important role in maintaining symptoms. The role of personality, mood, or anxiety
      in food reactions is debatable. Somatoform disorders ought to be identified early
      to avoid lengthy and frustrating investigations. A future task will be to improve
      diagnostic algorithms, to describe psychological aspects in clearly characterised
      patient subgroups, and to develop strategies for an optimized management of the
      various types of adverse reactions to food.

      bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To study the effects of fermented milk containing
      Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 and yoghurt strains on the IBS in a
      multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 274 primary care
      adults with constipation-predominant IBS (Rome II) were randomized to consume for
      6 weeks either the test fermented milk or a heat-treated yoghurt (control). HRQoL
      and digestive symptoms were assessed after 3 and 6 weeks on an intention-to-treat
      population of 267 subjects. RESULTS: The HRQoL discomfort score, the primary
      endpoint, improved (P < 0.001) in both groups at weeks 3 and 6. The responder
      rate for the HRQoL discomfort score was higher (65.2 vs. 47.7%, P < 0.005), as
      was the decrease in bloating score [0.56 +/- (s.d.)1.01 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.87, P =
      0.03], at week 3 in the test vs. the control group. In those subjects with <3
      stools/week, stool frequency increased (P < 0.001) over 6 weeks in the test vs.
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a beneficial effect of a
      probiotic food on discomfort HRQoL score and bloating in constipation-predominant
      IBS, and on stool frequency in subjects with <3 stools/week.

TI  - Effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota in
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 463-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multispecies probiotic has shown beneficial effects in irritable
      bowel syndrome. In addition, certain other probiotics have demonstrated
      advantageous effects, but the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. AIM: 
      To investigate the mode of action of a multispecies probiotic consisting of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium
      freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 by monitoring its
      effects on intestinal microbiota and markers of microbial activity. METHODS: A
      total of 55 irritable bowel syndrome patients participated in this
      placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Subjects received either multispecies
      probiotic or placebo supplementation daily during a 6-month period. The
      composition of intestinal microbiota was analysed with real-time polymerase chain
      reaction, short-chain fatty acids with gas chromatography and enzymes with
      spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Each supplemented probiotic strain was detected in
      faecal samples. Intestinal microbiota remained stable during the trial, except
      for Bifidobacterium spp., which increased in the placebo group and decreased in
      the probiotic group (P = 0.028). No changes in short-chain fatty acids occurred. 
      A decrease in ss-glucuronidase activity was detected in 67% of the subjects in
      the probiotic group vs. 38% in the placebo group (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Factors
      other than the microbial groups and metabolites studied herein seem responsible
      for the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by the multispecies
      probiotic.

TI  - An observational study of cholecystectomy in patients receiving tegaserod.
PG  - 581-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Registrational studies of patients treated with tegaserod for
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suggest an increased risk for cholecystectomy
      versus treatment with placebo. OBJECTIVE: To study cholecystectomy rates in
      association with tegaserod within a large administrative medical claims database.
      METHODS: Patients were drawn from a large population within the US with
      commercial medical insurance. The primary analysis consisted of a comparison of
      the observed incidence rate for cholecystectomy claims among a large cohort of
      new-to-therapy tegaserod users with an incidence rate published for
      tegaserod-naive patients classified with IBS within the same insured population. 
      RESULTS: An inception cohort of 7475 individuals with up to 103 weeks of claims
      history following initiation of therapy with tegaserod was identified. After a
      follow-up of 3 months (and thus similar to the longest registrational trials),
      the observed cholecystectomy incidence rate was 340 per 10,000 person-years (95% 
      CI 258, 442). The rate of cholecystectomy was highest in the earliest months of
      observation following initiation of tegaserod. The observed cholecystecomy
      incidence rate is 2.9 times higher than an IBS-specific rate of 119 per 10,000
      person-years as published for patients so classified within the same insured
      population. CONCLUSION: Based on a large, inception cohort, we report a strong
      temporal association between the initiation of tegaserod therapy and an increased
      rate for cholecystectomy. The effect size at 3 months was similar to the relative
      risk for cholecystectomy reported in registrational studies comparing tegaserod
      with placebo. As misclassification of initial diagnosis for patients presenting
      with biliary colic-like symptoms may occur, precise measurements of
      tegaserod-related relative risk for cholecystectomy from observational studies
      are problematic and will require prospective studies.

TI  - Nuances in treating irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a difficult disease to treat because of its
      ill-defined triggers, variable clinical course, and unpredictable myriad of
      symptoms of varying severity. Both doctors and patients are frustrated by the
      insidious nature of IBS--a nonlethal disorder that destroys lives, relationships,
      and careers. Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but
      are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A
      combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and
      therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms
      characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients
      with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved
      serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS
      and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although 
      they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target
      normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients
      in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing
      pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy. Overall, treatment
      approaches for IBS should address multisymptom relief and improvement of overall 
      patient well-being.

TI  - Alterations of food antigen-specific serum immunoglobulins G and E antibodies in 
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 823-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-prandial worsening of symptoms as well as adverse reactions to
      one or more foods are common in the patients with functional gastrointestinal
      diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD).
      However, the role played by true food allergy in the pathogenesis of these
      diseases is still controversial and there are no well-established tests to
      identify food allergy in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum food
      antigen-specific IgG, IgE antibody and total IgE antibody titres in controls and 
      patients with IBS and FD, and to correlate symptoms with the food
      antigen-specific IgG titres in IBS and FD patients. METHODS: Thirty-seven IBS
      patients, 28 FD patients and 20 healthy controls participated in this study.
      Serum IgG and IgE antibody titres to 14 common foods including beef, chicken,
      codfish, corn, crab, eggs, mushroom, milk, pork, rice, shrimp, soybean, tomatoes 
      and wheat were analysed by ELISA. Serum total IgE titres were also measured.
      Last, symptomatology was assessed in the study. Results IBS patients had
      significantly higher titres of IgG antibody to crab (P=0.000), egg (P=0.000),
      shrimp (P=0.000), soybean (P=0.017) and wheat (P=0.004) than controls. FD
      patients had significantly higher titres of IgG antibody to egg (P=0.000) and
      soybean (P=0.017) than controls. The percentage of individuals with detectable
      positive food antigen-specific IgE antibodies of the three groups did not show
      any significant differences (P=0.971). There were no significant differences
      between IBS patients, FD patients and controls in the serum total IgE antibody
      titres (P=0.978). Lastly, no significant correlation was seen between symptom
      severity and serum food antigen-specific IgG antibody titres both in IBS and FD
      patients. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG antibody titres to some common foods increased in
      IBS and FD patients compared to controls. But there is no significant correlation
      between symptom severity and elevated serum food antigen-specific IgG antibodies 
      in these patients.

TI  - [Novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 923-8
AB  - The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome due to the heterogeneous clinical
      symptoms and coexisting psychiatric disorders is still controversial. Although
      several agents with different mechanisms of action are widely used in clinical
      practice, there are only few drugs available with strong evidence of their
      efficacy, safety and tolerability at present. The etiology of irritable bowel
      syndrome is considered to be multifactorial: experimental and clinical research
      on visceral hypersensitivity, motility and brain-gut axis involving its
      neurotransmitters and receptors created the foundation of novel therapeutic
      approaches. Albeit nowadays several drugs (alosetron, tegaserod) have been
      registered in a few countries for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome,
      further large clinical trials are required related to the new chemical entities.

TI  - Seeking control through the determination of diet: a qualitative investigation of
      women with irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 152-60
AB  - PURPOSE: The overall objective of this investigation was to study the lived
      experience, in relation to diet, of women who have been diagnosed with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This study
      specifically explored pre-illness and postdiagnosis dietary patterns of
      participants with an emphasis on the changes, if any, that participants had made 
      to their diet. METHODS: This study took place on a university campus in
      southwestern Ontario, Canada. Eight women between the ages of 18 and 23 years
      were recruited. Participants completed a consent form, background questionnaire, 
      and a 14-day food diary. Participant also engaged in one-on-one semistructured
      interviews that consisted of 8 open-ended questions aimed at gaining a thorough
      understanding of the lived experience of these women, with respect to their
      dietary practices. RESULTS: The 3 major themes identified included: control;
      family and friend support; and adverse behaviors. The salient theme of control
      included the subthemes timing and awareness of surroundings, giving into
      temptations, and determination of diet. Determining one's diet, the subtheme that
      is addressed in this article, involved several key elements, including (1) the
      role of the physician(s), (2) experimentation, (3) seeking information, and (4)
      food modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Diet was the primary behavioral factor
      manipulated by participants to manage their conditions. The determination of
      potential trigger foods/beverages, however, entailed an often frustrating process
      of trial and error, in which few of the women received assistance from primary
      healthcare professionals. As a result, many of the women sought dietary
      information from alternate sources, some of which may not provide reliable
      information. Through experimentation and, for some, the documentation of food
      intake and symptom production, all participants identified food/beverage items
      they believed to cause symptom development. Although similar items were
      identified by many, all participants had individual triggers and sensitivities.

TI  - [Breath hydrogen levels do not predict fiber intolerance in irritable bowel
      syndrome with constipation].
PG  - 15-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is characterized by the worsening of
      symptoms with a high fiber diet. This intolerance could be related to an increase
      in colonic bacterial fermentation. The hydrogen breath test (HBT) is a marker of 
      the intestinal micro flora fermentative capacity. AIM: To assess if there is an
      association between hydrogen (H2) levels and clinical changes between diets with 
      and without bran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 women with predominantly constipated
      irritable bowel syndrome (Rome II criteria) received a lowfiber diet during one
      week. This phase was followed by a second 7 day period with the same diet but
      supplemented with 12 g of crude dietary fiber. At the end of both periods,
      patients completed a symptom scale (Lickert type) and performed a HBT. RESULTS:
      Comparing both periods with a different diet the median difference in the
      clinical scale score (-2.5) shows a tendency favorable to the diet without bran, 
      p = 0.048. In the fiber period the median increase of 2 ppm in H2 values was not 
      significant deferent. Neither was possible to establish an association between
      breath H2 and the clinical response to a fiber diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot
      study we could not detect ary association between breath H2 levels and the
      clinical response to dietary fiber.

TI  - Enterochromaffin cells of the human gut: sensors for spices and odorants.
PG  - 1890-901
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Release of serotonin from mucosal enterochromaffin cells
      triggered by luminal substances is the key event in the regulation of gut
      motility and secretion. We were interested to know whether nasal olfactory
      receptors are also expressed in the human gut mucosa by enterochromaffin cells
      and whether their ligands and odorants present in spices, fragrances, detergents,
      and cosmetics cause serotonin release. METHODS: Receptor expression was studied
      by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method in human mucosal
      enterochromaffin cells isolated by laser microdissection and in a cell line
      derived from human enterochromaffin cells. Activation of the cells by odorants
      was investigated by digital fluorescence imaging using the fluorescent Ca(2+)
      indicator Fluo-4. Serotonin release was measured in culture supernatants by a
      serotonin enzyme immunoassay and amperometry using carbon fiber microelectrodes
      placed on single cells. RESULTS: We found expression of 4 olfactory receptors in 
      microdissected human mucosal enterochromaffin cells and in a cell line derived
      from human enterochromaffin cells. Ca(2+) imaging studies revealed that odorant
      ligands of the identified olfactory receptors cause Ca(2+) influx, elevation of
      intracellular free Ca(2+) levels, and, consequently, serotonin release.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that odorants present in the luminal environment of
      the gut may stimulate serotonin release via olfactory receptors present in human 
      enterochromaffin cells. Serotonin controls both gut motility and secretion and is
      implicated in pathologic conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and irritable
      bowel syndrome. Thus, olfactory receptors are potential novel targets for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and motility disorders.

TI  - Recommendations on chronic constipation (including constipation associated with
      irritable bowel syndrome) treatment.
PG  - 3B-22B
AB  - While chronic constipation (CC) has a high prevalence in primary care, there are 
      no existing treatment recommendations to guide health care professionals. To
      address this, a consensus group of 10 gastroenterologists was formed to develop
      treatment recommendations. Although constipation may occur as a result of organic
      disease, the present paper addresses only the management of primary CC or
      constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. The final consensus group 
      was assembled and the recommendations were created following the exact process
      outlined by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology for the following areas:
      epidemiology, quality of life and threshold for treatment; definitions and
      diagnostic criteria; lifestyle changes; bulking agents and stool softeners;
      osmotic agents; prokinetics; stimulant laxatives; suppositories; enemas; other
      drugs; biofeedback and behavioural approaches; surgery; and probiotics. A
      treatment algorithm was developed by the group for CC and constipation associated
      with irritable bowel syndrome. Where possible, an evidence-based approach and
      expert opinions were used to develop the statements in areas with insufficient
      evidence. The nature of the underlying pathophysiology for constipation is often 
      unclear, and it can be tricky for physicians to decide on an appropriate
      treatment strategy for the individual patient. The myriad of treatment options
      available to Canadian physicians can be confusing; thus, the main aim of the
      recommendations and treatment algorithm is to optimize the approach in clinical
      care based on available evidence.

TI  - Effects of bacteria on the enteric nervous system: implications for the irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - S7-19
AB  - A unified scenario emerges when it is considered that a major impact of stress on
      the intestinal tract is reflected by symptoms reminiscent of the
      diarrhea-predominant form of irritable bowel syndrome. Cramping abdominal pain,
      fecal urgency, and explosive watery diarrhea are hallmarks not only of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, but also of infectious enteritis, 
      radiation-induced enteritis, and food allergy. The scenario starts with
      stress-induced compromise of the intestinal mucosal barrier and continues with
      microorganisms or other sensitizing agents crossing the barrier and being
      intercepted by enteric mast cells. Mast cells signal the presence of the agent to
      the enteric nervous system (ie, the brain-in-the-gut), which uses one of the
      specialized programs from its library of programs to remove the "threat." This is
      accomplished by stimulating mucosal secretion, which flushes the threatening
      agent into the lumen and maintains it in suspension. The secretory response then 
      becomes linked to powerful propulsive motility, which propels the secretions
      together with the offending agent rapidly in the anal direction. Cramping
      abdominal pain accompanies the strong propulsive contractions. Urgency is
      experienced when arrival of the large bolus of liquid distends the recto-sigmoid 
      region and reflexly opens the internal anal sphincter, with continence protection
      now provided only by central reflexes that contract the puborectalis and external
      anal sphincter muscles. Sensory information arriving in the brain from receptors 
      in the rapidly distending recto-sigmoid accounts for the conscious sensation of
      urgency and might exacerbate the individual's emotional stress. The symptom of
      explosive watery diarrhea becomes self-explanatory in this scenario.

TI  - Risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome in Turkish population: role of food
      allergy.
PG  - 380-3
AB  - GOALS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of food
      hypersensitivity in Turkish patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      BACKGROUND: The IBS is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract
      characterized by abdominal pain, distension, meteorism and either diarrhea or
      constipation. The role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS remains controversial. 
      Many investigators have shown that individual foods can trigger symptoms in some 
      patients; nevertheless, the percentage of patients that benefit from dietary
      manipulation ranges from 15% to 67% in different reports. STUDY: Skin prick test 
      to 11 common allergens, total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein and eosinophil
      counts were evaluated in 100 patients satisfying the Rome II criteria and
      compared with 25 healthy controls. The history and physical examination of the
      groups were recorded and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories were performed. 
      RESULTS: One hundred patients were entered into the study with a mean age of
      45.63+/-12.91 years. Of the patients 53 had constipation predominant, 19 had
      diarrhea predominant, and 28 had alternating type IBS. Skin prick tests
      positivity were more common among the IBS patients in comparison with controls
      (25% and 1%, respectively, P<0.05). Mean IgE values were higher in patients than 
      controls (70.83+/-66.05 and 15.20+/-14.01 IU/mL, respectively, P<0.000).
      Eosinophilic cationic protein values were also higher in IBS patients than
      controls (16.75+/-11.28 and 11.56+/-4.72, respectively, P<0.05) Evaluation of
      Beck Depression Inventory showed that tendency to depression in patients with IBS
      was 38% and 4% in controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, in
      patients complaining of IBS it is of importance to search for a food component.
      Clinical improvements can be observed after the introduction of an adequate
      exclusion diet.

TI  - [Therapy of functional bowel disorders].
PG  - 323-6
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome is the most frequent and most important functional
      bowel disease. It is characterized by a combination of abdominal pain,
      alterations of bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation) and meteorism. Probably,
      visceral hypersensitivity, motility disturbances, food intolerance, immunologic
      and microbiologic alterations and psychosomatic influences contribute to
      symptoms. In a relevant subgroup of patients the disease is triggered by
      bacterial infection. These patients usually have diarrhea-predominant disease.
      Irritable bowel syndrome can be diagnosed if typical symptoms are present and
      after relevant organic differential diagnoses have been excluded by selective
      biochemical investigations, abdominal ultrasonography and, if applicable, by
      colonoscopy. These diagnostic procedures are an important basis for therapeutic
      interventions and need to be complemented by clear information about the
      diagnosis and the benign long-term course of the disease. Medical therapy
      concentrates on treatment of predominant symptoms, i.e. pain, diarrhea,
      constipation and meteorism.

TI  - Characterization of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation in children with
      allergic diseases.
PG  - 1245-52
AB  - Allergy is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and constipation. We investigated whether allergic patients are
      more prone to constipation or IBS. In a multicenter study, two groups of
      outpatient children aged 3-13 years were included. In group 1, children with
      allergic symptoms were enrolled. Group 2 consisted of nonallergic children. In
      both groups, the assessment of IBS and constipation was carried out using a
      questionnaire based on the Rome criteria for functional gastrointestinal
      disorders. All children were examined and underwent skin prick tests (SPT) to
      foods and aeroallergens. The allergic group (n=196) and controls (n=127) were
      comparable with respect to sex, age, and anthropometric parameters. IBS was found
      in 6.6% of the allergic children and in 6.3% of the controls (p=0.581). The
      frequency of constipation was similar in the two groups. In allergic children,
      positive SPTs to food and self-reported reactions to food were associated with
      IBS. Our results show that evaluation of constipation comorbidity is not required
      in allergic children. In allergic children with positive SPT to foods attention
      may be paid to IBS symptoms.

TI  - Psyllium as therapeutic and drug delivery agent.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - There is no doubt that fibers, in particular viscous dietary fibers, have
      positive effects on human health, both in the prevention and in treatment of
      chronic diseases. Dietary fibers from psyllium have been used extensively both as
      pharmacological supplements, food ingredients, in processed food to aid weight
      control, to regulation of glucose control for diabetic patients and reducing
      serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemics. Keeping in view, the pharmacological
      importance of psyllium polysaccharide and its gel-forming nature, this article
      discusses the therapeutic value of psyllium for the treatment of constipation,
      diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease-ulcerative
      colitis, colon cancer, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia and exploitation of
      psyllium for developing drug delivery systems.

TI  - [Pre- and probiotics].
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to
      provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated
      actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological
      system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the
      scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very 
      active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut
      microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism.
      Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short
      chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are
      necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen
      bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the
      intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre-
      and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and
      probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added.
      Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of
      antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future 
      studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the
      evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies
      of adequate duration.

PG  - 1087-95
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the diagnostic process, frequency
      of associated disorders, family history, and impact of a gluten-free diet in
      individuals with celiac disease. All members of the Canadian Celiac Association
      (n=5240) were surveyed with a questionnaire. Respondents included 2681 adults
      with biopsy-proven celiac disease. The mean age was 56 years. Most common
      presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (83%), diarrhea (76%), and weight
      loss (69%). The mean delay in diagnosis was 11.7 years. Diagnoses made prior to
      celiac disease included anemia (40%), stress (31%), and irritable bowel syndrome 
      (29%). Osteoporosis was common. Prior to diagnosis, 27% of respondents consulted 
      three or more doctors about their symptoms. Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease
      remain a problem. Associated medical conditions occur frequently. More accurate
      food labeling is needed. Improved awareness of celiac disease and greater use of 
      serological screening tests may result in earlier diagnosis and reduced risk of
      associated conditions.

TI  - Probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome: a rationale for their use and an
      assessment of the evidence to date.
PG  - 166-72
AB  - Probiotics, defined as live organisms that, when ingested in adequate amounts,
      exert a health benefit on the host, have been used for almost a century in the
      management of a variety of medical disorders, usually on the basis of little
      evidence. Advances in our understanding of the gut flora and of its relationship 
      to the host, together with progress in microbiology, molecular biology and
      clinical research have identified important biological properties for probiotics 
      and demonstrated efficacy in a number of gastrointestinal disorders. The clear
      delineation of a post-infective variety of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as
      well as the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade
      inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional
      relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly,
      provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes
      of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, 
      are also plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to
      emerge, a review of available trials emphasises the importance of clear
      definition of strain selection, dose and viability. This is evidently an area of 
      great potential in IBS and deserves further study at all levels.

TI  - Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome after a food-borne outbreak of acute
      gastroenteritis attributed to a viral pathogen.
PG  - 457-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A large outbreak of acute gastroenteritis at the annual
      meeting of the Canadian Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (CSGNA)
      was attributed to food-borne norovirus. A prospective study was undertaken to
      determine the incidence and natural history of postinfectious irritable bowel
      syndrome (PI-IBS). METHODS: Questionnaires addressing demographics, medical
      history, acute illness, prior bowel function, and current symptoms were mailed to
      all delegates within 1 month of the outbreak. Follow-up questionnaires were
      mailed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The prevalence of new Rome I IBS among
      participants with and without acute enteric illness during the outbreak was
      calculated for each time point. Risk factors were assessed by multiple logistic
      regression. RESULTS: Baseline surveys were returned by 139 of 197 delegates
      (70.6%; mean age, 48 +/- 6 years; 95.0% female), of whom 135 (97.1%), 133
      (95.7%), 128 (92.1%), and 116 (83.4%) returned the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month
      surveys, respectively. One hundred seven respondents (76.9%) reported an acute
      enteric illness during the outbreak. Eighteen subjects reported premorbid IBS.
      Among the remainder, 21 of 89 who experienced gastroenteritis (23.6%) reported
      symptoms consistent with PI-IBS at 3 months versus 1 of 29 (3.4%) who remained
      well (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-48.7; P = .014). At 6, 12,
      and 24 months, the prevalence of IBS was similar among exposed versus nonexposed 
      individuals. In multiple logistic regression, vomiting during the acute illness
      independently predicted risk of PI-IBS at 3 months (odds ratio, 10.5; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.3-85.5; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: PI-IBS is common after
      presumptive viral gastroenteritis but might be more transient than after
      bacterial dysentery.

TI  - Bacterial flora in irritable bowel syndrome: role in pathophysiology,
      implications for management.
PG  - 2-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may, in part at least, result from a dysfunctional
      interaction between the indigenous flora and the intestinal mucosa which, in
      turn, leads to immune activation in the colonic mucosa. Some propose a role for
      bacterial overgrowth as a common causative factor in the pathogenesis of symptoms
      in IBS; other evidence points to more subtle qualitative changes in the colonic
      flora; both hypotheses remain to be confirmed but the likelihood that bacterial
      overgrowth will prove to be a major factor in IBS now seems remote. Nevertheless,
      short-term therapy with either antibiotics or probiotics does seem to reduce
      symptoms among IBS patients. It seems most likely that the benefits of antibiotic
      therapy are mediated through subtle and, perhaps, localized, quantitative and/or 
      qualitative changes in the colonic flora. How probiotics exert their effects
      remain to be defined but an anti-inflammatory effect seems likely. While this
      approach to the management of IBS is in its infancy, it is evident that
      manipulation of the flora, whether through the administration of antibiotics or
      probiotics, deserves further attention in IBS.

TI  - Tegaserod for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 267-77
AB  - Tegaserod, a selective and partial agonist at the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT
      [serotonin]) receptor subtype 4 (5-HT4), is the only United States Food and Drug 
      Administration-approved drug for the treatment of constipation-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women. The drug's stimulation of 5-HT4
      receptors on intestinal enterocytes increases peristaltic activity and fluid
      secretion into the gut lumen, facilitating stool passage. In addition, affinity
      of tegaserod for 5-HT4 receptors modulates visceral sensitivity, which helps
      alleviate abdominal pain associated with constipation-predominant IBS. The drug's
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters do not differ significantly with
      age or sex. Tegaserod safely and effectively relieves overall gastrointestinal
      symptoms and abdominal discomfort and normalizes bowel habits in patients with
      constipation-predominant IBS. It is associated with few drug interactions. In
      clinical studies, tegaserod was well tolerated, and its adverse-effect profile
      was similar to that of placebo. Severe diarrhea, as well as abdominal pain,
      flatulence, headache, and nausea, were the most commonly reported events.
      Patients who experience severe diarrhea should discontinue the drug. With the
      data available, tegaserod remains an option for patients with
      constipation-predominant IBS.

TI  - A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Lactobacillus GG for
      abdominal pain disorders in children.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are common in school-aged 
      children; however, there is no reliable treatment. AIM: To determine the efficacy
      of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A
      total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia
      (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were 
      enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received
      LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study
      population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no
      pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6,
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI:
      4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely
      to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3,
      95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02),
      but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n =
      47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately
      increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.

TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in outpatients with inflammatory bowel
      disease using a food and beverage intolerance, food and beverage avoidance diet.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the outpatient with chronic inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD) is a difficult but important challenge to recognize and treat. It
      is very helpful to have effective treatment approaches for IBS that are practical
      and use minimal medications. Because of the underlying chronic inflammation in
      IBD, IBS symptoms occur with increased frequency and severity, secondary to
      increased hypersensitivity to foods and beverages that stimulate the
      gastrointestinal tract. This paper discusses how to treat IBS in the IBD
      outpatient, with emphasis on using a food and beverage intolerance, avoidance
      diet. The adverse effects of many foods and beverages are amount dependent and
      can be delayed, additive, and cumulative. The specific types of foods and
      beverages that can induce IBS symptoms include milk and milk containing products;
      caffeine containing products; alcoholic beverages; fruits; fruit juices; spices; 
      seasonings; diet beverages; diet foods; diet candies; diet gum; fast foods;
      condiments; fried foods; fatty foods; multigrain breads; sourdough breads;
      bagels; salads; salad dressings; vegetables; beans; red meats; gravies; spaghetti
      sauce; stews; nuts; popcorn; high fiber; and cookies, crackers, pretzels, cakes, 
      and pies. The types of foods and beverages that are better tolerated include
      water; rice; plain pasta or noodles; baked or broiled potatoes; white breads;
      plain fish, chicken, turkey, or ham; eggs; dry cereals; soy or rice based
      products; peas; applesauce; cantaloupe; watermelon; fruit cocktail; margarine;
      jams; jellies; and peanut butter. Handouts that were developed based upon what
      worsens or helps IBS symptoms in patients are included to help patients learn
      which foods and beverages to avoid and which are better tolerated.

TI  - Nutrient-dependent enhancement of rectal sensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS).
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Food-related gastrointestinal symptoms are common in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), but the mechanisms behind this are unclear. Enhanced colorectal
      sensitivity after duodenal lipid administration in IBS patients has been
      demonstrated. However, the effects of a regular meal on colorectal sensitivity in
      these patients and the importance of the composition of the meal are not known.
      On two separate days, 10 IBS patients and 11 controls randomly received a liquid 
      meal (800 kcal), containing 60% calories from fat (fatty meal) or carbohydrate
      (carbohydrate meal). Using a barostat rectal sensitivity was assessed during four
      separate distension sequences before, immediately after and 30 and 60 min after
      the meal. In the patients, the discomfort (P = 0.04) and the pain thresholds (P =
      0.007) were gradually reduced after the fatty meal, whereas only a tendency in
      the same direction was seen after the carbohydrate meal. In patients VAS ratings 
      for pain increased after the fatty meal (P = 0.03), but not after carbohydrates. 
      In the controls, sensory thresholds were not affected by the meals. In IBS, a
      liquid meal enhances rectal sensitivity, and this seems to be partly nutrient
      dependent as a fatty meal has more pronounced effects than a carbohydrate meal.
      This might be of relevance for their postprandial symptoms.

TI  - Lipid-induced colonic hypersensitivity in the irritable bowel syndrome: the role 
      of bowel habit, sex, and psychologic factors.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Duodenal lipid infusion increases colonic hypersensitivity in 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Whether this is affected by bowel habit,
      psychologic factors, or sex is unknown. METHODS: We included 61 patients with IBS
      (50 women, 11 men), 25 with diarrhea-predominant IBS, 17 with
      constipation-predominant IBS, 19 with alternating-type IBS, and 20 healthy
      controls (15 women, 5 men). A colonic distension trial was performed with a
      barostat before and after a 1-hour duodenal lipid infusion (3 kcal/min). Colonic 
      thresholds, colonic tone, and the viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed
      and compared between groups. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression scale. RESULTS: The reduction in colonic pressure thresholds after vs 
      before duodenal lipids was greater in patients than in controls for discomfort (P
      = .006) and pain (P < .0001). An increased viscerosomatic referral area for pain 
      and discomfort during colonic distensions after vs before duodenal lipids was
      observed in patients but not in controls. The response was similar in IBS
      subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit, in patients with vs without
      anxiety and/or depression, and in women and men with IBS. The colonic tone
      response during lipid infusion was similar in IBS patients and controls, and in
      the different IBS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients show increased colonic
      sensitivity and altered viscerosomatic referral pattern after duodenal lipids.
      This response is largely unaffected by the predominant bowel habit, psychologic
      factors, or sex, but seems to be related to IBS per se.

AB  - Abdominal pain is common in the general population and, in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome, is attributed to visceral hypersensitivity. We found
      that oral administration of specific Lactobacillus strains induced the expression
      of mu-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells, and
      mediated analgesic functions in the gut-similar to the effects of morphine. These
      results suggest that the microbiology of the intestinal tract influences our
      visceral perception, and suggest new approaches for the treatment of abdominal
      pain and irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients show mast cell activation and hyperplasia in
      the jejunum.
PG  - 203-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased numbers of mast cells and mast cell activation in distal
      gut segments are associated with symptom onset and severity in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Although upper gut symptoms are common, mast cells have not been 
      thoroughly evaluated in proximal gut in IBS patients. METHODS: Jejunal biopsies
      obtained by Watson's capsule, aspiration of intestinal fluid and one blood sample
      were obtained in 20 diarrhoea-predominant patients with IBS (D-IBS) and 14
      healthy volunteers (H). Psychological stress (Holmes-Rahe Scale) and depression
      (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated at baseline and food and respiratory
      allergy excluded. Biopsies were processed for H&E staining and microscopic
      inflammation assessed by counting intraepithelial lymphocytes. Mast cells in
      lamina propria were counted by immunohistochemistry with CD117 (c-kit). Tryptase 
      concentration was measured in intestinal fluid and serum. RESULTS: D-IBS patients
      showed higher psychological stress than healthy volunteers (D-IBS: 203 (SD 114) v
      H: 112 (SD 99); p = 0.019). Immunohistochemical staining of jejunal mucosa
      revealed mild increase in intraepithelial CD3+ cells in D-IBS patients (D-IBS:
      15.3 (SD 5.5; 95% CI 12.7 to 17.9) v H: 10.3 (SD 3.9; 95% CI 8.0 to 12.5); p =
      0.006). Moreover, D-IBS patients showed marked increase in mast cells numbers
      (D-IBS: 34 (SD 9.3); H: 15.3 (SD 4.4) mast cells/hpf; p<0.001) and higher
      tryptase concentration in jejunal fluid (D-IBS: 0.45 (SD 0.38); H: 0.09 (SD 0.10)
      microg/l; p = 0.005). Upper gut symptoms were not associated with gender, mast
      cell counts, jejunal tryptase or basal stress. CONCLUSION: This jejunal mucosal
      inflammatory profile may help identify diarrhoea-predominant IBS, a
      stress-related disorder.
