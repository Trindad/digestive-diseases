PG  - 793-802
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, and diarrhea may complicate a pregnancy. 
      Complaints of IBS and constipation may be managed by nonpharmaceutical methods. A
      careful history should be conducted to determine whether these complaints are of 
      an acute or a long-standing nature. Conservative treatment of IBS is recommended 
      and may include stool-bulking agents, a high-fiber diet, elimination of offensive
      foods, and the behavioral treatment of passive muscle relaxation, biofeedback or 
      supportive psychotherapy. Constipation is generally self-limiting. It also may be
      treated conservatively with stool-bulking agents, increases in dietary fiber, and
      the addition of pelvic muscle exercises, preferably using electromyographic
      biofeedback. Laxatives should be used judiciously (Table 1). Diarrhea is caused
      most often by infectious agents in pregnancy but may also be from food poisoning 
      or a viral disease. Infectious diarrhea may be treated by mild antidiarrheal
      agents and safe antibiotics. Fluid replacement is the mainstay of treatment, and 
      care should be taken, remembering that the treatment involves two patients. These
      complaints can generally be managed conservatively, but persistent cases should
      be investigated as in a nonpregnant patient.

PG  - 2740-5
AB  - The author claims that dietary treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      consists of methods aiming at improvement of abdominal symptoms and functional
      disorder of the bowel. Patients with constipation are recommended to take dietary
      fiber positively, while those with diarrhea should consume sparingly food which
      may cool their body. Both should avoid overeating and overdrinking, and have
      regular dietary habits. In order to improve the functional disorder of the bowel,
      it is necessary for those patients (1) to be careful not to take often refined
      cereals or manufactured foods, (2) to eat green and yellow vegetables and
      seaweeds positively, as well as, protein and fat in proper quantity, and (3) to
      take care of the well-balanced intake of various kinds of vitamins, minerals and 
      other nutriments.

PG  - 2686-90
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common condition in gastroenterology
      clinics, but yet it is one of the pooly understood. A international working team 
      in Rome, 1988, proposed that IBS is a functional intestinal disorder with chronic
      or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms without structural or biochemical
      abnormalities. IBS was sub-classified into 3 groups; abdominal pain as the
      prominent feature with diarrhea, with constipation, with both while painless
      diarrhea and simple constipation without pain were excluded from IBS. There is a 
      lot of data suggesting that IBS has a gut dysmotility, which is influenced by
      many stimuli (food, hormone, drug, menses, mechanical dilatation), including
      psychological stress. Moreover, currently available evidences implicate that IBS 
      is a more generalized disorder of smooth muscle function not only in the
      intestine but also outside of the intestine.

TI  - Food allergy--fact or fiction: a review.
PG  - 560-4
AB  - Food sensitivity is a common condition presenting with various clinical syndromes
      including migraine, urticaria, gluten enteropathy, Crohn's disease and irritable 
      bowel syndrome. It is a heterogeneous condition affecting different organ systems
      and is also aetiologically diverse with subgroups due to allergy, pharmacological
      reactions, enzyme deficiencies and psychological causes. Clinical acceptance of
      food sensitivity has been delayed by the use of dubious diagnostic techniques by 
      a minority of practitioners and the lack of laboratory diagnostic tests, but
      several double blind studies have now fully validated the existence of food
      sensitivity syndromes. More widespread recognition of food sensitivity would be
      cost effective for the National Health Service.

TI  - Cholecystokinin's role in regulation of colonic motility in health and in
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1889-98
AB  - Colonic motor activity and plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK) both
      increase after oral intake of a meal. Thus, CCK had been thought to mediate the
      postprandial increase in colonic motor activity, which is termed gastrocolonic
      response. The present study used the substance loxiglumide, which acts as a
      specific antagonist at the CCK-A receptor, to evaluate this hypothesis. In the
      first set of experiments, eight healthy subjects were studied four times on
      separate days. A multilumen catheter was endoscopically placed with its tip lying
      in the descending colon. Motor activity was recorded by a low-compliance
      perfusion manometry system at six locations 60-45 cm from the anus. Basal
      activity was recorded for at least 2 hours to achieve steady-state conditions.
      The order of the following four experiments was randomized: (a) intravenous
      infusion of the CCK analogue cerulein at increasing doses (7.5, 15, 30, and 60
      ng/kg.h, each given for 30 minutes); (b) intravenous cerulein plus 5 mg/kg.h
      loxiglumide; (c) a 1000-kcal solid/liquid meal consisting of regular German food;
      and (d) a meal plus 5 mg/kg.h loxiglumide. In the second set of experiments,
      eight patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied twice on two separate
      days, and two experiments were performed n randomized order: (a) a 1000-kcal
      solid/liquid meal consisting of regular German food; or (b) a meal plus 5 mg/kg.h
      loxiglumide. The motor index was calculated as the area under contractions by a
      computerized system. The 1000-kcal meal markedly increased colonic motor
      activity. This gastrocolonic response was significantly greater in patients with 
      irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy volunteers. Cerulein stimulated motor
      activity only at pharmacological doses (30-60 ng/kg.h), which resulted in plasma 
      CCK levels markedly exceeding postprandial values. Loxiglumide abolished the
      effects of cerulein even at pharmacological doses. However, loxiglumide did not
      inhibit the gastrocolonic response to a regular meal either in healthy volunteers
      or in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Loxiglumide also failed to alter
      the interdigestive colonic motor activity. Therefore, effects mediated by the
      CCK-A receptor do not play a major physiological role in the regulation of the
      interdigestive and postprandial motility of the left colon.

PG  - 453-4
AB  - Candida albicans was sought in stool samples from 38 patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome and 20 healthy controls. In only three patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome was C. albicans discovered and these patients had either recently 
      received antibiotics or the stool sample had been delayed more than 24 hours in
      transit. C. albicans was isolated from none of the control stool samples. We
      conclude that C. albicans is not involved in the aetiology of the irritable bowel
      syndrome.

TI  - Runners' diarrhea. Different patterns and associated factors.
PG  - 101-4
AB  - One hundred and nine distance runners participated in a questionnaire survey of
      bowel function related to running. Thirteen (12%) had had fecal incontinence
      while running. Sixty-eight (62%) had stopped to have a bowel movement while
      training. Forty-seven (43%) had "nervous" diarrhea before competition and 13
      (12%) had stopped during competition for a bowel movement. Fifty-one (47%) had
      experienced diarrhea after racing or hard runs and 17 (16%) had seen blood in
      their stool in the same situations. Runners who had nervous diarrhea before
      competition were more likely to have symptoms of milk intolerance and irregular
      bowel function when not exercising, and runners who had symptoms of the irritable
      bowel syndrome often had to stop for a bowel movement during training. Runners
      with diarrhea after racing or hard runs frequently experienced severe abdominal
      cramps, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally, rectal bleeding at the same time. 
      Any form of "runners' diarrhea" was unrelated to age, previous intestinal
      infection or food poisoning, food allergies, or dietary fiber.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: assessment of psychological disturbance and its
      influence on the response to fibre supplementation.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - This study describes the effect of fibre supplementation on the gastrointestinal 
      symptoms and general wellbeing of patients with constipated irritable bowel
      syndrome. In a single centre, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 3 months 
      duration, a daily supplement of 4.1 g fibre produced no greater change in
      gastrointestinal symptoms than placebo. Pretreatment constipation was related to 
      baseline fibre intake. Overall outcome was the same in treated and control
      groups; a considerable placebo response was evident. This level of fibre
      supplementation is not a useful treatment; improving neither constipation nor
      other symptoms. At the outset pain severity correlated with depression score on
      psychometric testing. Those who felt better at the end of the study scored
      significantly lower for depression at outset than those who felt no better. In
      irritable bowel syndrome a depressive emotional state profile is a powerful
      determinant of outcome, shaping the response to treatment, which includes a
      considerable placebo element.

PG  - 55-7
AB  - Several studies on the usefulness of oral disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) in the
      treatment of systemic adverse reaction to foods have been performed, with less
      attention to gastroenterological symptoms. In the present study, we selected 101 
      patients with diarrheic-type irritable bowel syndrome which improved after an
      elimination diet and worsened after a challenge with specific food(s). All
      patients were then tested for 48 commercial alimentary antigens by skin prick
      test (SPT) and underwent 8 wk of oral DSCG (500 mg three times a day), and the
      results were evaluated by means of a semiquantitative subjective and objective
      score. We observed an improvement of the symptoms in 67% of the 74 SPT-positive
      patients, whereas only 41% of the 27 SPT-negative patients showed a positive
      response to DSCG (p less than 0.05). These data confirm the protective role of
      DSCG in food-dependent diarrheic-type irritable bowel syndrome with food allergy 
      features.

TI  - Is the irritable gut an inflamed gut?
PG  - 102-5
AB  - Recent advances in the field of neuroimmunology have provided clear
      demonstrations of i) the neuromodulation of immune function, and ii) the
      involvement of the immune system in responses induced by psychologic stress in
      animals and in man. This has led to speculation about the role of the immune
      system in psychosocial disease. The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is
      characterized by chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may reflect in
      altered motility, epithelial function, or sensory perception in the gut. IBS is
      heterogeneous not only in terms of its clinical presentation but also in terms of
      its pathogenesis, and factors ranging from psychoneurotic behavior and emotional 
      stress, to dietary fiber deficiency, food intolerance, and enteric infection have
      been implicated. There is evidence of an increase in the inflammatory cells
      present in the gut of some IBS patients and in an emerging literature that
      demonstrates the immunomodulation of the motor system of the gut. These findings 
      invite speculation that the immune system may play a role in the pathogenesis and
      pathophysiology of at least a subpopulation of IBS patients.

TI  - The value of prescribed 'high-fibre' diets for the treatment of the irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 601-9
AB  - The symptoms of 72 patients with irritable bowel syndrome were assessed by
      questionnaire before and 6 months after a high-fibre diet had been prescribed, to
      find whether those who achieved the highest fibre intake did any better than
      those with smaller intakes. Dietary fibre intakes were measured after 6 months by
      a 7-day weighed food inventory. There was a significant inverse association
      between the presence of symptoms and fibre intake for: incomplete defaecation,
      urgency and hard stools with total fibre intake; urgency and hard stools with
      cereal fibre intake; and borborygmi with fibre intake at breakfast. All patients 
      with constipation, mucus, urgency or watery stools at the beginning of the study,
      and who were consuming more than 30 g fibre by the end, reported an improvement
      in these symptoms. Increasing intakes of fibre were not related in any way to
      abdominal distension, diarrhoea, flatulence or patient's feelings about the
      working of their bowels. Therefore, this study suggests that the symptoms which
      benefit most from the prescription of a high-fibre diet are hard stools,
      constipation and urgency.

TI  - Aleatory clinical study comparing otilonium bromide with a fiber-rich diet in the
      treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - We studied 114 patients affected by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (group A = 53 
      patients, group B = 61). Group A received diet with high content of roughage (20 
      g of fibers) and 10 g of bran, group B received otilonium bromide (OB) 40mg tid
      and normal diet (10-15 g of fibers). Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, bowel 
      movements were evaluated before treatment (T0) at the end (T24) and after 12
      months (T12). In group B otilonium bromide induced a significant improvement (p
      less than 0.01) of abdominal pain and distension when comparing T0 with T24. In
      group A diet produced an improvement, albeit not significant, of the
      aforementioned parameters at T24. On the basis of our data OB seems to be more
      effective than a high-fiber diet in the treatment of IBS.

TI  - Therapeutic strategy for the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 53-5
AB  - The major aims of medical therapy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are: a) to
      ameliorate symptoms (pain, bowel movement abnormalities, bloating) and b) to
      improve psychological problems of the patients. The first step of IBS therapy is 
      the diet. In fact some forms of IBS can be ascribed to food intolerance. When
      abdominal pain, meteorism and constipation are the main symptoms, treatment with 
      high-fiber diet, antispastic and antimuscarinic drugs is indicated. Sometimes
      amitriptyline, an antidepressant which also shows anticholinergic and analgesic
      properties, can be helpful. When diarrhoea is prevalent, the most effective drug 
      is represented by loperamide. If diarrhoea is related to meal ingestion,
      antispastic or antimuscarinic drugs can be successfully used. In the case of
      diarrhoea related to documented cholorrhoea, cholestyramine can be of benefit.
      Furthermore, there are some resistant cases, secondary to striking psychological 
      problems that require sedatives and antidepressant drugs and sometimes, psycho
      and/or hypnotherapy.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of a fiber-enriched formula on infant colic.
PG  - 695-701
AB  - Because infants with colic appear to have abdominal pain similar to that of
      adults with irritable bowel syndrome, who may benefit from the addition of fiber 
      to their diet, we tested whether fiber added to infant formula would alleviate
      colic. Twenty-seven normal, term infants (aged 2 to 8 weeks; 14 girls) with
      colic, defined as crying plus fussing for more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 
      days of a 6-day baseline period, were enrolled. Infants were randomly assigned in
      9-day periods to a sequence of placebo (Isomil formula) followed by
      fiber-supplemented formula (Isomil plus soy polysaccharide) (n = 12) or the
      reverse (n = 15). Daily diaries of crying, fussing, sleeping, formula, intake,
      and stooling were kept. Twenty-two infants completed three lactulose breath
      hydrogen tests at the end of the baseline period and after each study period. The
      crossover trial was followed by 30 to 35 days of use of the study formula chosen 
      by the parents as most beneficial but unknown to the investigators. Growth was
      monitored throughout. Serum cholesterol, calcium, phosphate, albumin, iron, and
      zinc concentrations were measured at the conclusion. There were no significant
      differences in average daily time spent by the infants in fussing and crying
      during ingestion of the fiber-supplemented formula. However, parents of 18 of 27 
      infants chose fiber-supplemented formula as most beneficial in ameliorating
      symptoms of colic. While the infants were consuming fiber-supplemented formula,
      stool frequency increased, and breath hydrogen excretion increased significantly,
      in response to lactulose. Growth and serum biochemical measurements were normal
      in all infants. Supplementation of infant formula with the level of soy
      polysaccharide used in this study may have reduced crying and fussing in some
      infants but did not affect colicky behavior in the majority of infants, who
      continued to cry and fuss excessively.

PG  - 569-72
AB  - Twenty patients with irritable bowel syndrome due to food intolerance were
      randomized to either oral sodium cromoglycate or placebo in a double-blind
      cross-over trial. The study consisted of treatment with either sodium
      cromoglycate or placebo for 8 weeks, followed by the cross-over treatment for 8
      further weeks. Patients were allowed to eat the offending foods during the study.
      Eighteen patients completed the study. Analysis of patients' diary card scores
      showed a statistically significant difference in favour of sodium cromoglycate.
      There was a long carry-over effect in the active-placebo order group. Therefore
      oral sodium cromoglycate seems to be a useful treatment in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome and proven food intolerance.

TI  - [Digestive manifestations of food hypersensitivity in adults].
PG  - 289-94
AB  - Food allergy, synonymous with food hypersensitivity (FHS), is defined as an
      immunologically-mediated adverse reaction to food. Initiation of FHS could result
      from a break in the immune mucosal barrier with abrogation of oral tolerance.
      Food hypersensitivity is mostly due to immediate-type reaction involving
      IgE-dependent mastocytes activation. Changes in intestinal function and structure
      have been mainly studies in an animal model of rat sensitized to egg albumin.
      Intraluminal antigen challenge resulted in abnormalities of gut absorption,
      secretion and motility in sensitized rats. In man, experimental data are scarce. 
      Gastrointestinal manifestations of immediate FHS are varying and unspecific. A
      role for FHS in irritable bowel syndrome is debated. Participation of
      delayed-type FHS to digestive diseases is still questionable, but eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis might be an example. In clinical practice, diagnosis of FHS
      demands rigorous criteria. Double blind placebo-controlled food challenge has
      eventually proved to be the "gold standard" test for FHS diagnosis.

TI  - New directions in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 335-49
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an umbrella for the diagnosis of
      heterogeneous conditions that are awaiting better identification of specific
      manometric causes. This article focuses on the concept that future therapy for
      IBS will rely on identification of subgroups and in turn tailor the specific
      therapeutic approaches to an appreciation of the pathophysiology and symptom
      predominance of these subgroups. Future therapies will rely on the following
      principles: (1) prokinetic agents to coordinate upper gastrointestinal and
      colonic motility as well as improve the propulsive nature of colonic
      contractions; (2) gastrointestinal hormone agonists such as erythromycin and
      antagonists such as sandostatin and cholecystokinin antagonists; (3) spasmolytic 
      therapy incorporating calcium channel blocking and anticholinergic agents; (4)
      inhibition of ovulatory cycle changes in circulating concentrations of gonadal
      hormones in women, who tend to dominate the IBS population; (5) incorporation of 
      concepts relating to the role of subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors in
      control of neural and myogenic function; (6) reassessment of food intolerance and
      sensitivity; and (7) incorporation of concepts relating to psychologic profiles
      and psychologic treatment approaches. IBS is a rich and fertile area for
      application of the exciting new pharmacologic advances relating to
      gastrointestinal smooth-muscle and neural innervation of the gut. Improvement in 
      the understanding and treatment of IBS will be one of the major accomplishments
      of this decade.

AB  - Food intake plays a key role in triggering or perpetuating symptoms in patients
      with IBS. Evaluation of the impact of diet in the individual patient requires a
      precise dietary history and a 7-day prospective dietary analysis, which should
      include the quality and quantity of food consumed, chronologic sequence and
      nature of symptoms, and the frequency and consistency of bowel movements. The
      caloric density of the meal, total fat intake, the quantity and quality of
      lactose-containing foods, sorbitol, fructose, and the nature and quantity of
      soluble and insoluble fiber intake must be noted. Patients with reflux esophageal
      symptoms should eliminate foods that decrease LES pressure, such as chocolate,
      peppermint, alcohol, and coffee. Direct esophageal mucosal irritants such as
      tomatoes, citrus juices, sharp condiments, and alcohol should be limited. Gastric
      emptying is slowed with the ingestion of fats and soluble fiber. Small bowel
      motility is slowed by soluble fiber and fatty foods. Gaseous syndromes may be
      reduced by avoidance of smoking, chewing gum, excessive liquid intake, and
      carbonated drinks. The reduced intake of large amounts of lactose-containing
      foods, sorbitol, and fructose may limit postprandial bloating. Flatus production 
      can be lowered by reducing fermentable carbohydrates such as beans, cabbage,
      lentils, brussel sprouts, and legumes. Soluble and insoluble fiber ingestion will
      reduce sigmoidal intraluminal pressures and overcome spastic constipation when
      given in progressive graded doses. Effective dietary manipulations remain a key
      factor in reducing symptoms in IBS.
