TI  - [A meta-analysis of the prevalence and risk factors of irritable bowel syndrome
      in Chinese community].
PG  - 969-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors for irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) in China. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies relevant to IBS
      conducted among Chinese were identified through the databases including PubMed,
      Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang data and VIP. Quality of
      studies was assessed according to the criteria for cross-sectional studies
      recommended by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Analysis of
      data, publication bias and sensitivity were performed with Stata (Version 12.0). 
      RESULTS: A total of twenty-three studies were extracted. No obvious publication
      bias was detected in all analysis except the effect of depression on IBS
      prevalence. Pooled prevalence of IBS in China was 6.5%. IBS was more common in
      women than in men (8.1% vs 6.8%;OR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.09-1.38) and high rate in age 
      group between 30 to 59 years (6.9%; OR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.12-1.32) . Intestinal
      infection history (OR = 2.39, 95%CI 1.69-3.38), anxiety (OR = 2.95, 95%CI
      1.94-4.49), depression (OR = 1.85, 95%CI 1.11-3.09), food allergy (OR = 2.80,
      95%CI 2.12-3.67) and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.07-1.24) might
      increase the risk for IBS. There were no significant difference of IBS prevalence
      between urban and rural areas (OR = 0.97, 95%CI 0.72-1.29) , neither in different
      education classes (OR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.70-1.03) . Sub-group analysis showed IBS
      prevalence varied apparently with different diagnostic criteria: prevalence
      defined by Manning was 11.8% and by RomeIIand Rome III prevalence values were
      4.4% and 8.9% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled prevalence of IBS in China was
      6.5%. IBS is more common in age group between 30 to 59 years. Female, history of 
      intestinal infection, anxiety, depression, food allergy and alcohol consumption
      were risk factors for IBS in Chinese population.

TI  - Effects of a kefir supplement on symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel
      satisfaction score in patients with chronic constipation: a pilot study.
PG  - 650-6
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.6990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although probiotics have been extensively studied in irritable
      bowel syndrome, data on the impact of probiotics on chronic constipation are
      scarce. We aimed to evaluate the effects of kefir, which is a probiotic fermented
      milk product, on the symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel satisfaction scores of 
      patients with chronic constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive
      patients with functional constipation according to the Rome II criteria were
      divided into two groups based on their colon transit studies: 1. The normal
      transit (NT) group (n=10); and 2. The slow transit (ST) group (n=10). After a
      baseline period, 500 mL/day of a probiotic kefir beverage was administered to all
      patients for 4 weeks. Defecation parameters (stool frequency, stool consistency, 
      degree of straining, laxative consumption) were recorded in diaries daily by the 
      patients. Bowel satisfaction scores were assessed using a visual analog scale.
      The colon transit study was repeated in the ST group at the end of the study.
      RESULTS: At the end of the study, the patients showed an increased stool
      frequency (p<0.001), improved stool consistency (p=0.014), and decreased laxative
      consumption (p=0.031). The degree of straining during evacuation showed a
      tendency to improve after kefir administration; however, this was not
      statistically significant (p=0.18). A repeat transit study showed an acceleration
      of colonic transit in the ST group (p=0.013). Bowel satisfaction scores also
      improved (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that kefir has positive
      effects on the symptoms of constipation. Our results also suggest that kefir
      improves bowel satisfaction scores and accelerates colonic transit. Controlled
      trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

PG  - 799-803

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbiota plays an integral part in maintaining organism
      homeostasis, through eliminat pathogens, anti-cancer activity, synthesis of
      digestive enzymes and vitamins, maintaining the continuity of the intestinal
      epithelium and stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune system, and encourage a
      quicker and more efficient immune response. Changes in the microbiota composition
      is often observed in patients with allergy, atopy, irritable bowel syndrome and
      other diseases, which is the reason for a growing interest in methods of
      identification of the gut microbial complex. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was 
      to compare the state of current knowledge about two methods used in the study of 
      intestinal microorganisms complex: the traditional culture method and genetic
      analysis. DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: Both techniques have advantages 
      and disadvantages. The biggest limitation of the culture method is its inability 
      to detect a significant number of the intestinal microbes. Using the
      microbiological technique we can only detect identifiable bacteria that can be
      grown on available substrates. For an accurate quantitative and qualitative
      investigation of the total microbiota, the more expensive genetic method is
      required. Due to genetic analysis it is possible to identify the vast number of
      new microorganisms and identify the dominant bacterial groups in different parts 
      of the gastrointestinal tract. SUMMARY: Each of the presented techniques plays
      specific role in medicine and science. The combination of both methods may become
      a critical element for understanding the ecosystem of intestinal bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate clinical symptoms in subjects with irritable
      bowel syndrome receiving Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Overall, 179 adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome (Rome III criteria) were randomized to receive once daily 500 mg
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, delivered by one capsule (n = 86, F: 84%, age: 42.5 
      +/- 12.5), or placebo (n = 93, F: 88%, age: 45.4 +/- 14) for 8 weeks followed by 
      a 3-week washout period. After a 2-week run-in period, cardinal symptoms
      (abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distension, bowel movement difficulty) and
      changes in stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily and assessed each 
      week. A safety assessment was carried out throughout the study. RESULTS: The
      proportion of responders, defined by an improvement of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      was significantly higher (p = 0.04) in the treated group than the placebo group
      (63% vs 47%, OR = 1.88, 95%, CI: 0.99-3.57) in the last 4 weeks of treatment. A
      non-significant trend of improvement was observed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      for the other symptoms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was well tolerated and did not
      affect stool frequency and consistency. CONCLUSION: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
      well tolerated and reduces abdominal pain/discomfort scores without stool
      modification. Thus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be a new promising candidate for
      improving abdominal pain in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of a low fermentable, oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) and the probiotic
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      Randomised, unblinded controlled trial on the effect of 6-wk treatment with LFD, 
      LGG or a normal Danish/Western diet (ND) in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome III
      diagnostic criteria, recruited between November 2009 and April 2013. Patients
      were required to complete on a weekly basis the IBS severity score system
      (IBS-SSS) and IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) questionnaires in a specially
      developed IBS web self-monitoring application. We investigated whether LFD or LGG
      could reduce IBS-SSS and improve QOL in IBS patients. RESULTS: One hundred
      twenty-three patients (median age 37 years, range: 18-74 years), 90 (73%) females
      were randomised: 42 to LFD, 41 to LGG and 40 to ND. A significant reduction in
      mean +/- SD of IBS-SSS from baseline to week 6 between LFD vs LGG vs ND was
      revealed: 133 +/- 122 vs 68 +/- 107, 133 +/- 122 vs 34 +/- 95, P < 0.01. Adjusted
      changes of IBS-SSS for baseline covariates showed statistically significant
      reduction of IBS-SSS in LFD group compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 75; 95%CI:
      24-126, P < 0.01), but not in LGG compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 32; 95%CI: 18-80,
      P = 0.20). IBS-QOL was not altered significantly in any of the three groups: mean
      +/- SD in LFD 8 +/- 18 vs LGG 7 +/- 17, LFD 8 +/- 18 vs ND 0.1 +/- 15, P = 0.13. 
      CONCLUSION: Both LFD and LGG are efficatious in patients with IBS.

TI  - Non-celiac gluten hypersensitivity.
PG  - 71-8
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in 
      recent years. The condition is characterized by both gastrointestinal and
      extra-intestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal. Most of the symptoms
      are subjective and for many years such patients remain in a diagnostic dilemma.
      Although symptomalogy is similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), NCGS is now
      regarded as a distinct clinical entity. However, the disease pathology is not
      well elucidated and our knowledge of NCGS is still very rudimentary. This review 
      highlights the importance of this new clinical entity, outlines its pathological 
      mechanisms and suggests a diagnostic algorithm for its management.

      knowledge and potential applications.
PG  - 16518-28
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i44.16518 [doi]
AB  - Although it is now known that the human body is colonized by a wide variety of
      microbial populations in different parts (such as the mouth, pharynx and
      respiratory system, the skin, the gastro- and urogenital tracts), many effects of
      the complex interactions between the human host and microbial symbionts are still
      not completely understood. The dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota
      is considered to be one of the most important contributing factors in the
      development of many gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease,
      irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like
      obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fecal
      microbial transplantations appear to be promising therapies for
      dysbiosis-associated diseases; however, probiotic microorganisms have been
      growing in popularity due to increasing numbers of studies proving that certain
      strains present health promoting properties, among them the beneficial balance of
      the intestinal microbiota. Inflammatory bowel diseases and obesity are the
      pathologies in which there are more studies showing this beneficial association
      using animal models and even in human clinical trials. In this review, the
      association of the human gut microbiota and human health will be discussed along 
      with the benefits that probiotics can confer on this symbiotic activity and on
      the prevention or treatment of associated diseases.

TI  - [The diet low in fermentable carbohydrates short chain and polyols improves
      symptoms in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders in Spain].

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Successful treatment of patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) often remains elusive. Recent studies in Australia, the United
      Kingdom and New Zealand have suggested the efficacy of a diet low in fermentable 
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in the
      management of these patients. The aims of this study were to determine whether a 
      diet low in FODMAPs improves symptoms in patients with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in Spain and to analyze the predictors of a
      good response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
      consecutive patients with FGID type IBS and functioanl abdominal bloating. At
      inclusion all patients underwent an assessment through a baseline demographic
      questionnaire of symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life. A
      hydrogen breath test with lactose and fructose was performed and a low FODMAPs
      diet was indicated for 2 months by expert dietitians. These tests were taken as a
      reference. A positive response was defined as an improvement of at least 5 points
      out of a possible 10 in the symptom questionnaire. RESULTS: We included 30
      patients (24 women, 39 [12] years). The response to the low FODMAPs diet was
      positive in controlling overall symptoms and specific symptoms such as functioanl
      abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and fatigue in
      more than 70% of patients (P<.05). By contrast, constipation was controlled in
      only 48% of patients (P>.05). Adherence to the diet was good in 87% of patients
      and was a predictor of positive response in the univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      A diet low in FODMAPs is associated with symptom improvement in patients with IBS
      and functioanl abdominal bloating. Adherence to the diet was a determining
      factor.

TI  - Relationship between fructose and lactose intakes and functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms in a sample of 50-year-old Cantabrians in New Zealand.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - AIMS: To examine the relationship between fructose and lactose consumption and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in 50-year-old adults residing in
      Canterbury, New Zealand. METHODS: The Canterbury Health Ageing and Life Course
      (CHALICE) study is a study of 50-year-old Cantabrians. A 4-day estimated food and
      beverage diary (FBD) was completed by 227 participants, 75.7% of those recruited.
      The Birmingham IBS symptom questionnaire was administered and individual
      participant scores were calculated for constipation, diarrhoea, pain score, and
      total symptom score. Associations between symptoms and the intake of fructose and
      lactose were examined using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Greater mean
      daily intakes of fructose (P=0.05) and lactose (P=0.04) were associated with a
      lower prevalence of IBS pain symptoms after adjusting for demographics and social
      economic status. However there was no evidence of an association with
      constipation, diarrhoea or total IBS score. CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show
      inverse relationships between fructose and lactose intakes and IBS pain symptoms,
      the use of cross-sectional data do not allow us to determine causality in these
      relationships. However it is possible that participants may have reduced their
      intake of fructose and lactose in response to IBS related pain. Follow up of this
      cohort would allow us to determine if this is the case. Future research could
      also investigate whether people with IBS could benefit from guidance from a
      dietitian around consumption of high lactose or fructose-containing foods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may help resolve bowel symptoms and improve quality of
      life. We investigated the effects of 12 weeks of probiotics administration in
      colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. The participants took probiotics (Lacidofil) or placebo
      twice a day for 12 weeks. The cancer-related quality of life (FACT), patient's
      health-9 (PHQ-9), and bowel symptom questionnaires were completed by each
      participant. RESULTS: We obtained data for 32 participants in the placebo group
      and 28 participants in the probiotics group. The mean ages of total participants 
      were 56.18 +/- .86 years and 58.3% were male. Administration of probiotics
      significantly decreased the proportion of patients suffering from irritable bowel
      symptoms (0 week vs. 12 week; 67.9% vs. 45.7%, p=0.03), improved colorectal
      cancer-related FACT (baseline vs. 12 weeks: 19.79 +/- 4.66 vs. 21.18 +/- 3.67,
      p=0.04) and fatigue-related FACT (baseline vs. 12 weeks: 43.00 (36.50-45.50) vs. 
      44.50 (38.50-49.00), p=0.02) and PHQ-9 scores (0 weeks vs. 12 weeks; 3.00
      (0-8.00) vs. 1.00 (0-3.00), p=0.01). We found significant differences in changes 
      of the proportion of patients with bowel symptoms (p<0.05), functional well-being
      scores (p=0.04) and cancer-related FACT scores (p=0.04) between the two groups.
      CONCLUSION: Probiotics improved bowel symptoms and quality of life in colorectal 
      cancer survivors.

TI  - Risk of low bone mineral density and low body mass index in patients with
      non-celiac wheat-sensitivity: a prospective observation study.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/s12916-014-0230-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or 'wheat sensitivity' (NCWS) is
      included in the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. No data are available on
      the prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in NCWS. Our study aims to evaluate
      the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients and search for correlations with other
      clinical characteristics. METHODS: This prospective observation study included 75
      NCWS patients (63 women; median age 36 years) with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-like symptoms, 65 IBS and 50 celiac controls. Patients were recruited at
      two Internal Medicine Departments. Elimination diet and double-blind placebo
      controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge proved the NCWS diagnosis. All subjects
      underwent BMD assessment by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), duodenal
      histology, HLA DQ typing, body mass index (BMI) evaluation and assessment for
      daily calcium intake. RESULTS: DBPC cow's milk proteins challenge showed that 30 
      of the 75 NCWS patients suffered from multiple food sensitivity. Osteopenia and
      osteoporosis frequency increased from IBS to NCWS and to celiac disease (CD) (P
      <0.0001). Thirty-five NCWS patients (46.6%) showed osteopenia or osteoporosis.
      Low BMD was related to low BMI and multiple food sensitivity. Values of daily
      dietary calcium intake in NCWS patients were significantly lower than in IBS
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated frequency of bone mass loss in NCWS patients
      was found; this was related to low BMI and was more frequent in patients with
      NCWS associated with other food sensitivity. A low daily intake of dietary
      calcium was observed in patients with NCWS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding of chronic sequelae development after Campylobacter
      infection is limited. The objective of the study was to determine via systematic 
      review and meta-analysis the proportion of Campylobacter cases that develop
      chronic sequelae. METHODS: A systematic review of English language articles
      published prior to July 2011 located using Pubmed, Agricola, CabDirect, and Food 
      Safety and Technology Abstracts. Observational studies reporting the number of
      Campylobacter cases that developed reactive arthritis (ReA), Reiter's syndrome
      (RS), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ,Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) or Miller Fisher 
      syndrome (MFS) were included. Data extraction through independent extraction of
      articles by four reviewers (two per article). Random effects meta-analysis was
      performed and heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) value. Meta-regression
      was used to explore the influence of study level variables on heterogeneity.
      RESULTS: A total of 31 studies were identified; 20 reported on ReA, 2 reported on
      RS, 9 reported on IBS, 3 studies reported on IBD, 8 reported on GBS, 1 reported
      on MFS and 3 reported on HUS. The proportion of Campylobacter cases that
      developed ReA was 2.86% (95% CI 1.40% - 5.61%, I(2) = 97.7%), irritable bowel
      syndrome was 4.01% (95% CI 1.41% - 10.88%, I(2) = 99.2%). Guillain Barre syndrome
      was 0.07% (95% CI 0.03% - 0.15%, I(2) = 72.7%). CONCLUSIONS: A significant number
      of Campylobacter cases develop a chronic sequela. However, results should be
      interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity.

TI  - Low-FODMAP Diet for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Is It Ready for Prime Time?
PG  - 1169-77
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3436-4 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease, which
      adversely affects the quality of life. Its prevalence has been reported to be
      around 10-15 % in North America and constitutes the most common cause for
      gastroenterology referral. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of IBS is not
      completely understood. Not surprisingly, the management strategies can leave the 
      patients with inadequate symptom control, making IBS a debilitating
      gastrointestinal syndrome. Dietary interventions as a treatment strategy for IBS 
      have been recently evaluated. One such intervention includes dietary restriction 
      of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs
      define a group of short-chain carbohydrates that are incompletely absorbed in
      small intestine and later fermented in the colon. Evidence in the form of
      randomized controlled trials and observational studies have evaluated the
      mechanism of action and efficacy of low-FODMAP diet. This dietary intervention
      has showed promising results in symptom reduction in IBS patients. However,
      latest trials have also shown that the low-FODMAP diet is associated with marked 
      changes in gut microbiota specifically reduction in microbiota with prebiotic
      properties. Implications of such changes on gastrointestinal health need to be
      further evaluated in future trials.

TI  - Intestinal permeability--a new target for disease prevention and therapy.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12876-014-0189-7 [doi]
AB  - Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier
      and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are
      poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical
      significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge
      on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. 
      First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are 
      defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting
      permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where
      billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand,
      an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of
      microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb
      essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex
      anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the
      functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the 
      regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In
      particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut,
      infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other
      lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess 
      intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary
      enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier.
      The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this
      functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other
      environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated
      with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory
      bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more
      recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are
      characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of
      luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a
      feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of
      relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more
      attention.

AB  - The controversial effects of dietary fiber on symptoms in functional
      gastrointestinal disorders are summarized. Studies concerning adverse reaction to
      foods are mentioned and the possible role of food allergy and food intolerances, 
      especially pseudoallergic reactions to biogenes amines, in symptom provocation is
      discussed. The known effects of lactose deficiency and fructose malabsorption are
      reviewed. The FODMAP concept (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and
      polyols) is presented in more detail and recent studies on pathophysiological
      effects of FODMAP constituents and of therapeutic effects of a low FODMAP diet on
      symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are discussed. Finally,
      studies on the new disorder non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are summarized
      and the state of the discussion whether wheat intolerance is due to gluten or the
      grains is given.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota in health and disease: role of bifidobacteria in gut
      homeostasis.
PG  - 15163-76
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i41.15163 [doi]
AB  - The pool of microbes inhabiting our body is known as "microbiota" and their
      collective genomes as "microbiome". The colon is the most densely populated organ
      in the human body, although other parts, such as the skin, vaginal mucosa, or
      respiratory tract, also harbour specific microbiota. This microbial community
      regulates some important metabolic and physiological functions of the host, and
      drives the maturation of the immune system in early life, contributing to its
      homeostasis during life. Alterations of the intestinal microbiota can occur by
      changes in composition (dysbiosis), function, or microbiota-host interactions and
      they can be directly correlated with several diseases. The only disease in which 
      a clear causal role of a dysbiotic microbiota has been demonstrated is the case
      of Clostridium difficile infections. Nonetheless, alterations in composition and 
      function of the microbiota have been associated with several gastrointestinal
      diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, or irritable bowel
      syndrome), as well as extra-intestinal pathologies, such as those affecting the
      liver, or the respiratory tract (e.g., allergy, bronchial asthma, and cystic
      fibrosis), among others. Species of Bifidobacterium genus are the normal
      inhabitants of a healthy human gut and alterations in number and composition of
      their populations is one of the most frequent features present in these diseases.
      The use of probiotics, including bifidobacteria strains, in preventive medicine
      to maintain a healthy intestinal function is well documented. Probiotics are also
      proposed as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders and other
      pathologies. The World Gastroenterology Organization recently published potential
      clinical applications for several probiotic formulations, in which species of
      lactobacilli are predominant. This review is focused on probiotic preparations
      containing Bifidobacterium strains, alone or in combination with other bacteria, 
      which have been tested in human clinical studies. In spite of extensive
      literature on and research into this topic, the degree of scientific evidence of 
      the effectiveness of probiotics is still insufficient in most cases. More effort 
      need to be made to design and conduct accurate human studies demonstrating the
      efficacy of probiotics in the prevention, alleviation, or treatment of different 
      pathologies.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome is positively related to metabolic syndrome: a
      population-based cross-sectional study.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder that may affect
      dietary pattern, food digestion, and nutrient absorption. The nutrition-related
      factors are closely related to metabolic syndrome, implying that irritable bowel 
      syndrome may be a potential risk factor for metabolic syndrome. However, few
      epidemiological studies are available which are related to this potential link.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether irritable bowel syndrome is
      related to metabolic syndrome among middle-aged people. We designed a
      cross-sectional study of 1,096 subjects to evaluate the relationship between
      irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome and its components. Diagnosis of 
      irritable bowel syndrome was based on the Japanese version of the Rome III
      Questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria of the
      American Heart Association scientific statements of 2009. Dietary consumption was
      assessed via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Principal-components
      analysis was used to derive 3 major dietary patterns: "Japanese",
      "sweets-fruits", and "Izakaya (Japanese Pub) "from 39 food groups. The prevalence
      of irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome were 19.4% and 14.6%,
      respectively. No significant relationship was found between the dietary pattern
      factor score tertiles and irritable bowel syndrome. After adjustment for
      potential confounders (including dietary pattern), the odds ratio (95% confidence
      interval) of having metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides for subjects
      with irritable bowel syndrome as compared with non-irritable bowel syndrome are
      2.01(1.13-3.55) and 1.50(1.03-2.18), respectively. Irritable bowel syndrome is
      significantly related to metabolic syndrome and it components. This study is the 
      first to show that irritable bowel syndrome was significantly related to a higher
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides among an adult
      population. The findings suggest that the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome
      may be a potentially beneficial factor for the prevention of metabolic syndrome. 
      Further study is needed to clarify this association.

LID - 10.5604/17322693.1127882 [doi]
AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

PG  - e111225
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0111225 [doi]
AB  - A variety of foods have been implicated in symptoms of patients with Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but wheat products are most frequently cited by patients as 
      a trigger. Our aim was to investigate the effects of breads, which were fermented
      for different lengths of time, on the colonic microbiota using in vitro batch
      culture experiments. A set of in vitro anaerobic culture systems were run over a 
      period of 24 h using faeces from 3 different IBS donors (Rome Criteria-mainly
      constipated) and 3 healthy donors. Changes in gut microbiota during a time course
      were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), whilst the
      small-molecular weight metabolomic profile was determined by NMR analysis. Gas
      production was separately investigated in non pH-controlled, 36 h batch culture
      experiments. Numbers of bifidobacteria were higher in healthy subjects compared
      to IBS donors. In addition, the healthy donors showed a significant increase in
      bifidobacteria (P<0.005) after 8 h of fermentation of a bread produced using a
      sourdough process (type C) compared to breads produced with commercial yeasted
      dough (type B) and no time fermentation (Chorleywood Breadmaking process) (type
      A). A significant decrease of delta-Proteobacteria and most Gemmatimonadetes
      species was observed after 24 h fermentation of type C bread in both IBS and
      healthy donors. In general, IBS donors showed higher rates of gas production
      compared to healthy donors. Rates of gas production for type A and conventional
      long fermentation (type B) breads were almost identical in IBS and healthy
      donors. Sourdough bread produced significantly lower cumulative gas after 15 h
      fermentation as compared to type A and B breads in IBS donors but not in the
      healthy controls. In conclusion, breads fermented by the traditional long
      fermentation and sourdough are less likely to lead to IBS symptoms compared to
      bread made using the Chorleywood Breadmaking Process.

PG  - 1333-51
LID - 10.1017/S0950268814002829 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the
      proportion of cases of non-typhoidal salmonellosis (NTS) that develop chronic
      sequelae, and to investigate factors associated with heterogeneity. Articles
      published in English prior to July 2011 were identified by searching PubMed,
      Agricola, CabDirect, and Food Safety and Technology Abstracts. Observational
      studies reporting the number of NTS cases that developed reactive arthritis
      (ReA), Reiter's syndrome (RS), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Guillain-Barre syndrome
      (GBS), Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) were included. Meta-analysis was performed
      using random effects and heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 value.
      Meta-regression was used to explore the influence of study-level variables on
      heterogeneity. A total of 32 studies were identified; 25 reported on ReA, five
      reported on RS, seven reported on IBS, two reported on IBD, two reported on GBS, 
      one reported on MFS, and two reported on HUS. There was insufficient data in the 
      literature to calculate a pooled estimate for RS, HUS, IBD, GBS, or MFS. The
      pooled estimate of the proportion of cases of NTS that developed ReA and IBS had 
      substantive heterogeneity, limiting the applicability of a single estimate. Thus,
      these estimates should be interpreted with caution and reasons for the high
      heterogeneity should be further explored.

TI  - Sequelae of foodborne illness caused by 5 pathogens, Australia, circa 2010.
PG  - 1865-71
LID - 10.3201/eid2011.131316 [doi]
AB  - In Australia circa 2010, 4.1 million (90% credible interval [CrI] 2.3-6.4
      million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis occurred, many of which might have
      resulted in sequelae. We estimated the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and
      deaths from Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome, irritable bowel
      syndrome, and reactive arthritis that were associated with contaminated food in
      Australia. Data from published studies, hospital records, and mortality reports
      were combined with multipliers to adjust for different transmission routes. We
      used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate median estimates and 90% CrIs. In
      Australia, circa 2010, we estimated that 35,840 (90% CrI 25,000-54,000)
      illnesses, 1,080 (90% CrI 700-1,600) hospitalizations, and 10 (90% CrI 5-14)
      deaths occurred from foodborne gastroenteritis-associated sequelae. Campylobacter
      spp. infection was responsible for 80% of incident cases. Reducing the incidence 
      of campylobacteriosis and other foodborne diseases would minimize the health
      effects of sequelae.

TI  - Review article: the diagnosis and management of food allergy and food
      intolerances.
PG  - 3-25
LID - 10.1111/apt.12984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse reactions to food include immune mediated food allergies and 
      non-immune mediated food intolerances. Food allergies and intolerances are often 
      confused by health professionals, patients and the public. AIM: To critically
      review the data relating to diagnosis and management of food allergy and food
      intolerance in adults and children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane
      Database were searched up until May 2014, using search terms related to food
      allergy and intolerance. RESULTS: An estimated one-fifth of the population
      believe that they have adverse reactions to food. Estimates of true IgE-mediated 
      food allergy vary, but in some countries it may be as prevalent as 4-7% of
      preschool children. The most common food allergens are cow's milk, egg, peanut,
      tree nuts, soy, shellfish and finned fish. Reactions vary from urticaria to
      anaphylaxis and death. Tolerance for many foods including milk and egg develops
      with age, but is far less likely with peanut allergy. Estimates of IgE-mediated
      food allergy in adults are closer to 1-2%. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies such
      as Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome are rarer and predominantly
      recognised in childhood. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders including
      eosinophilic oesophagitis are mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergic
      conditions, and are improved by dietary exclusions. By contrast food intolerances
      are nonspecific, and the resultant symptoms resemble other common medically
      unexplained complaints, often overlapping with symptoms found in functional
      disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Improved dietary treatments for the
      irritable bowel syndrome have recently been described. CONCLUSIONS: Food
      allergies are more common in children, can be life-threatening and are distinct
      from food intolerances. Food intolerances may pose little risk but since
      functional disorders are so prevalent, greater efforts to understand adverse
      effects of foods in functional disorders are warranted.

TI  - Beliefs about management of irritable bowel syndrome in primary care:
      cross-sectional survey in one locality.
PG  - 263-9
LID - 10.1017/S1463423614000383 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine beliefs about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management among
      primary care physicians. BACKGROUND: There have been considerable advances in
      evidence synthesis concerning management of IBS in the last five years, with
      guidelines for its management in primary care published by the National Institute
      for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional
      web-based questionnaire survey of 275 primary care physicians. We emailed a link 
      to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire, containing 18 items, to all eligible primary
      care physicians registered with three clinical commissioning groups in Leeds, UK.
      Participants were given one month to respond, with a reminder sent out after two 
      weeks. FINDINGS: One-hundred and two (37.1%) primary care physicians responded.
      Among responders, 70% believed IBS was a diagnosis of exclusion, and >80% checked
      coeliac serology often or always in suspected IBS. Between >50% and >70% believed
      soluble fibre, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and psychological therapies were
      potentially efficacious therapies. The respondents were less convinced that
      antidepressants or probiotics were effective. Despite perceived efficacy of
      psychological therapies, 80% stated these were not easily available. Levels of
      use of soluble fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were in the range of 40%
      to >50%. Most primary care physicians obtained up-to-date evidence about IBS
      management from NICE guidelines. Most primary care physicians still believe IBS
      is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many are reluctant to use antidepressants or
      probiotics to treat IBS. More research studies addressing diagnosis and treatment
      of IBS based in primary are required.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation are prevalent 
      and burdensome gastrointestinal disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of the evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and chronic
      idiopathic constipation has recently been performed. By far, the most convincing 
      evidence was for the use of probiotics in IBS, which reported that overall
      probiotics reduced the risk of symptom persistence by 21%. However, only a
      minority of the trials were at a low risk of bias, and some used small sample
      sizes. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to combine individual small trials to
      improve the power to detect the direction, size, and consistency of an effect,
      but it can do little to overcome the poor design of individual trials. Many
      debate the use of meta-analysis to combine data from different probiotic species,
      strains, or combinations. It is recommended that all future meta-analyses of
      probiotics, in any clinical setting, perform subgroup analysis on specific
      species/strains and specific combinations. It is hoped that the current
      meta-analysis will empower clinicians in making evidence-based decisions
      regarding whether probiotics should be recommended for IBS, which
      species/strain(s) to use, and for which symptoms.

TI  - The role of food intolerance in functional gastrointestinal disorders in
      children.
PG  - 686-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) is a common, benign,
      chronic diagnosis that has a significant negative impact on quality of life.
      FGIDs that develop in childhood can persist into adulthood. Currently, there is
      no cure and few treatment options are available. OBJECTIVE: This article provides
      an outline of current research supporting the role of food intolerance in
      children with FGIDs. DISCUSSION: Food intolerances have long been reported by
      patients with FGIDs; however, randomised controlled trials are lacking in this
      area. Food intolerances that have been investigated include intolerance to food
      chemicals, lactose, fructose and, more recently, fer-mentable carbohydrates,
      termed FODMAPs. The low-FODMAP diet eliminates poorly absorbed short-chain
      carbohydrates and has a clearly defined mechanism of action. Emerging evidence
      suggests it alleviates symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and,
      potentially, also in children. However, more evidence is required for the
      efficacy of the diet in children and in oth-er subgroups of FGID. Any dietary
      restriction in growing children should be undertaken with clinical supervision by
      a dietitian.

TI  - Abnormal accumulation of intestinal fluid following ingestion of an unabsorbable 
      carbohydrate in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: an MRI study.
PG  - 1686-93
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postprandial discomfort following intake of poorly absorbable, but
      fermentable carbohydrates is a common complaint in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). We used lactulose as a model substance for this group of symptom 
      triggering carbohydrates, aiming to visualize the intestinal response in IBS
      patients compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with IBS according to
      Rome III criteria (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 16) underwent a lactulose
      challenge test. By using magnetic resonance imaging, we measured small bowel
      water content (SBWC), and distension (diameter) of the distal ileum and the
      colon, both in fasting state and 1 h after ingestion of 10 g lactulose. We
      recorded symptoms after lactulose ingestion. KEY RESULTS: Lactulose provoked
      significantly more symptoms in IBS patients than in healthy controls (p <
      0.0001). SBWC increased more in the patient group compared to the control group
      (p = 0.0005). The postprandial diameter of the terminal ileum was larger in
      patients with IBS and the postprandial diameter of the ascending colon was
      smaller in patients with diarrhea-predominant phenotype (IBS-D). Symptoms were
      not correlated with change in SBWC (r = 0.05; p = 0.11), nor to the diameters of 
      the terminal ileum or the colon. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Compared to healthy
      controls, IBS patients developed more symptoms and had an abnormal accumulation
      of fluid in the small bowel in response to ingestion of the unabsorbable
      carbohydrate lactulose. This may be due to impaired motor activity of the small
      intestine or impaired function of the ileocecal segment.

AB  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is challenging for both primary care 
      physicians and gastroenterologists because of the heterogeneity of the patient
      population and the multifactorial pathophysiologies responsible for the symptoms 
      in IBS. This review focuses on the current and emerging pharmacological
      treatments for IBS. Many of the current medications used to treat this disorder
      have distinct properties such as efficacy for different symptoms, safety
      profiles, contraindications, costs, dosing regimens, treatment duration and
      long-term data. All of these factors, in addition to patient preference and
      cognitive, food and environmental triggers, must be considered prior to any
      medication selection. This review will focus on randomized controlled trials with
      a general uniformity in study design, a rigorous patient selection and
      appropriate treatment durations. We will also discuss other exciting emerging
      treatments for IBS such as the micro-opioid receptor (agonists and antagonists), 
      selective kappa-opioid receptor agonists, anti-inflammatory drugs, serotonergic
      agents, bile acid modulators and intestinal bile acid transporters, which may
      prove promising in treating our patients.

PG  - 142-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most prevalent functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. It is a multifactorial disorder with its pathogenesis
      attributed to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation,
      visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on.
      Traditionally, IBS has been treated with diet and lifestyle modification, fiber
      supplementation, psychological therapy, and pharmacological treatment.
      Carbohydrates are intermingled with a wide range of regularly consumed food
      including grains such as rye and wheat, vegetables, fruits, and legumes.
      Short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the
      intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by
      bacteria with consequent gas production. These effects may be the basis for the
      induction of most of the gastrointestinal symptoms. This has led to the use of
      lactose-free diets in those with lactose intolerance and of fructose-reduced
      diets for fructose malabsorption. As all poorly absorbed short-chain
      carbohydrates have similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has
      been developed to regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a
      dietary approach that restricts them all. Based on the observational and
      comparative studies, and randomized-controlled trials, FODMAPs have been shown to
      trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. Food choice via the low
      FODMAPs and potentially other dietary strategies is now a realistic and
      efficacious therapeutic approach for managing symptoms of IBS.

TI  - The use of probiotics in IBD and IBS.
PG  - 491-500
AB  - While the role of microflora is well established in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBS); data is still emerging regarding IBS as the
      knowledge on brain-gut interaction grows. For both patient groups multiple
      efficacious treatments exist, but there are still unmet needs as long term
      disease control remains an issue. Given the importance of the microbiome on the
      development of the immune system and the interaction between the microbiome and
      the host organism, this "route" is being examined increasingly as a therapeutic
      possibility in both pathologies with variable results. We here provide a short
      overview on the existing data, meta-analysis and single studies, on probiotic
      treatment in both diseases.

AB  - A chronic continuous or intermittent gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, the
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), appears to be due to dysregulation of
      brain-gut-microbiota communication. Furthermore, the "microbiota" greatly impacts
      the bi-directional brain-gut axis communication. This article describes IBS in
      relation to similar diseases, presents the background to osteopathy, and proposes
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to manage IBS. In IBS, OMT focuses on
      the nervous and circulatory systems, spine, viscera, and thoracic and pelvic
      diaphragms in order to restore homeostatic balance, normalize autonomic activity 
      in the intestine, promote lymphatic flow, and address somatic dysfunction.
      Lymphatic and venous congestion are treated by the lymphatic pump techniques and 
      stimulation of Chapmans reflex points. A simple treatment plan designed to lessen
      chronic pain and inflammation in IBS is presented based on current evidence-based
      literature. Since food itself, food allergies, and intolerance could contribute
      to symptom onset or even cause IBS, this article also provides dietary
      modifications to consider for patients.

PG  - 6328
LID - 10.1038/srep06328 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota (GM) consists of resident commensals and transient microbes
      conveyed by the diet but little is known about the role of the latter on GM
      homeostasis. Here we show, by a conjunction of quantitative metagenomics, in
      silico genome reconstruction and metabolic modeling, that consumption of a
      fermented milk product containing dairy starters and Bifidobacterium animalis
      potentiates colonic short chain fatty acids production and decreases abundance of
      a pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia compared to a milk product in subjects with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, n = 28). The GM changes parallel improvement of
      IBS state, suggesting a role of the fermented milk bacteria in gut homeostasis.
      Our data challenge the view that microbes ingested with food have little impact
      on the human GM functioning and rather provide support for beneficial health
      effects.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for a multitude of digestive and immune
      functions which depend upon the balanced interaction of the intestinal
      microbiota, diet, gut barrier function, and mucosal immune response. Disruptions 
      in one or more of these factors can lead to intestinal disorders or enteropathies
      which are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability,
      and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Enteropathy is frequently associated
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, inflammatory bowel disease,
      autoimmune enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 
      where pathologic changes in the intestinal tract lead to abdominal discomfort,
      bloating, abnormal bowel function (e.g., diarrhea, urgency, constipation and
      malabsorption). Unfortunately, effective therapies for the management of
      enteropathy and restoring intestinal health are still not available. An
      accumulating body of preclinical studies has demonstrated that oral
      administration of plasma- or serum-derived protein concentrates containing high
      levels of immunoglobulins can improve weight, normalize gut barrier function, and
      reduce the severity of enteropathy in animal models. Recent studies in humans,
      using serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate, demonstrate that such 
      protein preparations are safe and improve symptoms, nutritional status, and
      various biomarkers associated with enteropathy. Benefits have been shown in
      patients with HIV infection or diarrhea-predominant IBS. This review summarizes
      preclinical and clinical studies with plasma/serum protein concentrates and
      describes the effects on host nutrition, intestinal function, and markers of
      intestinal inflammation. It supports the concept that immunoglobulin-containing
      protein preparations may offer a new strategy for restoring functional
      homeostasis in the intestinal tract of patients with enteropathy.

AB  - Accumulating clinical evidence supports co-morbidity of irritable bowel,
      irritable eye and irritable mind symptoms. Furthermore, perturbation of the
      microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism
      connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consequently, 
      maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to
      treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. Current treatment approach
      assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with
      prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the
      symbiosis. However, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed
      probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic
      symptoms. Recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept
      study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins A, B, D and 
      omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. These findings suggested a
      conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as
      targets for intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common diagnosis in
      gastroenterology. Its etiology is unknown and therapeutic options limited. Trials
      suggest probiotics may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to assess the
      symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v (L. plantarum 299 v) for
      the relief of abdominal pain in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome II criteria.
      METHODS: This study was conducted in a referral hospital. Trial participants were
      randomized to receive either two capsules of L. plantarum 299 v at a dosage of 5 
      x 10(9) cfu per capsule or placebo daily for 8 wk. Severity of abdominal pain was
      assessed using a visual analog scale at each visit and a quality-of-life IBS
      (QoL-IBS) questionnaire was also completed. RESULTS: There was no significant
      difference in abdominal pain relief between the study and placebo groups (P =
      0.800). There was also no difference in QoL- IBS scores between the groups (P =
      0.687). Both groups had a significant improvement in abdominal pain scores over
      the study period, from an average of 251.55 to 197.90 (P < 0.0001) indicating a
      large placebo effect. CONCLUSION: An 8-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299 v did
      not provide symptomatic relief, particularly of abdominal pain and bloating, in
      patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria.

PG  - 430-6
LID - 10.4161/gmic.29796 [doi]
AB  - The last ten years' wide progress in the gut microbiota phylogenetic and
      functional characterization has been made evidencing dysbiosis in several
      gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gut disease with high prevalence and
      negative impact on patient's quality of life characterized mainly by visceral
      pain and/or discomfort, representing a good paradigm of chronic gut
      hypersensitivity. The IBS features are strongly regulated by bidirectional
      gut-brain interactions and there is increasing evidence for the involvement of
      gut bacteria and/or their metabolites in these features, including visceral pain.
      Further, gut microbiota modulation by antibiotics or probiotics has been
      promising in IBS. Mechanistic data provided mainly by animal studies highlight
      that commensals or probiotics may exert a direct action through bacterial
      metabolites on sensitive nerve endings in the gut mucosa, or indirect pathways
      targeting the intestinal epithelial barrier, the mucosal and/or systemic immune
      activation, and subsequent neuronal sensitization and/or activation.

AB  - The gut endocrine cells control and regulate several functions of the
      gastrointestinal tract. They have been reported to be abnormal in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), with alterations occurring in several functions regulated by
      these cells. Furthermore, it has been established that gut endocrine cells
      interact with the gut lumen contents, particularly the nutrients. The present
      study was undertaken to establish whether the positive outcome of dietary
      guidance observed in patients suffering from IBS is associated with a change in
      gastric endocrine cells. A total of 46 patients with IBS participated in the
      present study, of which 14 completed all aspects. These patients included nine
      females and five males with a mean age of 34 years (range, 2045 years). In the
      healthy control group, nine females and five males, with a mean age of 54 years
      (range 2670 years) were selected. The patients and controls underwent gastroscopy
      with biopsy samples taken from the corpus and antrum of the stomach. Each patient
      attended three sessions that lasted ~45 min each, and received individual
      guidance on their dietary management. The patients followed the diet prescribed
      for a minimum of three months, then further samples were taken using a method
      similar to that used for the initial biopsies. The biopsy samples were
      immunostained using the avidinbiotin complex method for chromogranin A (CgA) and 
      quantified by computerized image analysis. The patients with IBS presented a low 
      density of CgA compared with the controls. The density of CgA increased in these 
      patients following dietary guidance and changes in food intake. The present
      observations emphasized the interaction between food intake and gut endocrine
      cells. The current study also suggests that the positive effects of dietary
      guidance may be attributed to changes in gut endocrine cell density.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: the problem and the problem of treating it - is there a
      role for probiotics?
PG  - 470-6
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114000706 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) in those patients who consult the medical profession and examine the
      therapeutic potential of probiotics in this condition, where there is a strong
      need for new treatment options. Traditionally, IBS is frequently regarded as a
      trivial condition which is certainly not life threatening and mainly
      psychological in origin. However, these preconceptions are misplaced, as in some 
      patients the condition can be devastating with the pain being as severe as that
      of childbirth coupled with incapacitating bowel dysfunction. In addition,
      patients suffer from a variety of non-colonic symptoms such as low backache,
      constant lethargy, nausea and genito-urinary problems, all of which lead to these
      patients having extremely poor quality of life. Unfortunately, the treatment of
      IBS is very unsatisfactory with only one new medication being developed for this 
      condition in the last 25 years. It is now recognised that IBS is a multifactorial
      condition with symptoms being triggered by a variety of factors, some of which
      appear to be influenced by probiotics, resulting in speculation that they may
      have therapeutic potential in this condition. There have been over thirty
      controlled clinical trials of probiotics in IBS with approximately two-thirds of 
      these studies showing evidence of an improvement in symptoms. However, not all
      probiotics appear to be effective with different symptoms being improved by
      different strains and some improving symptoms more than others. Consequently, the
      ideal probiotic for the treatment of IBS has yet to be defined, but the evidence 
      is good enough to encourage further research with the aim of identifying an
      optimal strain or strains.

TI  - PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales in
      pediatric patients with functional and organic gastrointestinal diseases in
      comparison to healthy controls.
PG  - 363-78
LID - 10.1007/s11136-014-0781-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI)
      symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and
      organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient
      self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The
      secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other.
      METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in 
      a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of
      patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia,
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When 
      Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea
      and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were
      administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and
      thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the
      PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric
      patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, 
      supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms
      and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics
      across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy
      samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.

TI  - Self medicated antibiotics in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional health survey
      conducted in the Rajshahi City.
PG  - 847
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-847 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic self medication is highly prevalent in the developing
      countries due to easy availability and poor regulatory controls for selling these
      drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of
      self-medication with antibiotics for the treatment of various diseases by the
      peoples of Rajshahi city in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was
      conducted to the patient's (n = 1300) at eight locations of Rajshahi city in
      Bangladesh from March to April, 2014. The locations were selected by convenience 
      and the study population within each study area was randomly selected. The survey
      was self-administered and included questions pertaining to self medicated drugs
      and antibiotic usage patterns as well. Data were analyzed using descriptive
      statistics. RESULTS: It was found that 347 (26.69%) out of 1300 participants
      experienced self medication with antibiotics. Over fifty percent of the patients 
      studied were between the ages of 21-30 years with 83.57% of them being males and 
      16.43% females. The highest percentage of self medicated antibiotics was
      metronidazole (50.43%) followed by azithromycin (20.75%), ciprofloxacin (11.53%),
      amoxicillin (10.37%) and tetracycline (7.49%) respectively. The key reasons for
      the self medication of antibiotics was the pre-experience (45.82%), suggestions
      from others (28.24%) and knowledgeable of the antibiotics (16.14%). The perceived
      symptoms to purchase the antibiotics independently was dysentery, diarrhea and
      food poisoning (36.02%), cold, cough and fever (28.24%), infection (12.97%),
      dental carries and toothache (9.22%), irritable bowel syndrome (3.46%), acne
      (4.32%), ear and throat pain (2.31%). The duration of maximum antibiotics usage
      was ranges between 0-10 years. Only 4.32% patient's used self medicated
      antibiotics longer than 10 years. The patient's compliance for self medication of
      antibiotics varies from excellent to no comments whereas only 6.92% patients
      reported side effects for the self medication of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of this study confirm that antibiotic self-medication is a relatively
      frequent problem in Bangladesh. Drug Administration of Bangladesh should
      implement the regulatory controls immediately on the distribution and selling of 
      antibiotics in order to reduce the frequency of antibiotic misuse.

TI  - An insight into the gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia: clinical
      manifestations and potential underlying mechanisms.
PG  - 433-44
LID - 10.1007/s00296-014-3109-9 [doi]
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized pain accompanied by
      a broad symptomatologic spectrum. Besides chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances,
      headaches and cognitive dysfunction that are extensively described in the
      literature, a considerable proportion of patients with fibromyalgia experience
      gastrointestinal symptoms that are commonly overlooked in the studies that are
      not specifically dedicated to evaluate these manifestations. Nevertheless,
      various attempts were undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal dimension of
      fibromyalgia. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated comorbidity of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among patients with fibromyalgia. Other studies
      have investigated the frequency of presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in
      fibromyalgia in a nonspecific approach describing several gastrointestinal
      complaints frequently reported by these patients such as abdominal pain,
      dyspepsia and bowel changes, among others. Several underlying mechanisms that
      require further investigation could serve as potential explanatory hypotheses for
      the appearance of such manifestations. These include sensitivity to dietary
      constituents such as gluten, lactose or FODMAPs or alterations in the brain-gut
      axis as a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or subclinical enteric 
      infections such as giardiasis. The gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia
      constitutes a relevant element of the multidisciplinary pathophysiologic
      mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia that need to be unveiled, as this would
      contribute to the adequate designation of relevant treatment alternatives
      corresponding to these manifestations.

TI  - General practitioners roles and experiences with functional foods containing
      probiotics and plant sterols.
PG  - 254-62
LID - 10.1017/S1463423614000280 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this research is to explore whether general practitioners
      have experiences with functional foods within their clinical practice.
      BACKGROUND: Previous research and editorials have suggested that general
      practitioners should have more involvement and knowledge of functional foods.
      This is due to the thought that functional foods may be consumed by their
      patients that could lead to other issues, such as patients not taking their
      medication. Therefore, research into general practitioners involvement with
      functional foods needs to be conducted. METHOD: In all, 10 semi-structured open
      interviews were used with a topic guide. These interviews where digitally audio
      recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts where analysed using thematic 
      analysis. FINDINGS: It was found that general practitioners believed they did not
      have a direct role with functional foods and should not be involved with
      discussing them with their patients. They felt that if they where to be involved 
      with functional foods then they would need more training and information about
      them. They also felt that functional foods could be empowering for their
      patients.

      healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of 
      individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the
      controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9
      months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were
      immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were
      quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin 
      cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were
      149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 
      +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the
      gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/-
      24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of
      serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4
      and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI
      18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the
      somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/-
      3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 
      22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell
      types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a 
      change in food intake.

TI  - Melatonin regulation as a possible mechanism for probiotic (VSL#3) in irritable
      bowel syndrome: a randomized double-blinded placebo study.
PG  - 186-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3299-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have treatment efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      but the exact mechanism remains obscure. One hypothesis is the mediation of
      melatonin levels, leading to changes in IBS symptoms. AIM: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic, VSL#3, on symptoms,
      psychological and sleep parameters, and pain sensitivity in IBS, and relate these
      parameters to in vivo melatonin levels. METHODS: Forty-two IBS patients were
      randomly assigned to receive VSL#3 or placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects completed
      bowel and psychological questionnaires, underwent rectal sensitivity testing and 
      saliva melatonin assays. RESULTS: Abdominal pain duration and distension
      intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic group, along with an increase 
      in rectal distension pain thresholds. A correlation between increase in pain
      tolerance and improvement in abdominal pain scores (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) was seen 
      with probiotic. There was an increase in salivary morning melatonin levels in
      males treated with VSL#3, which correlated (r = 0.61) with improved satisfaction 
      in bowel habits. When grouped based on baseline diurnal melatonin levels,
      patients with normal diurnal fluctuations showed an increase in morning melatonin
      levels with VSL#3 treatment, which significantly correlated with improved
      satisfaction in bowel habits (r = 0.68). They also had reduced symptom severity
      scores and abdominal pain duration when treated with VSL#3, as well as
      satisfaction with bowel movements and quality-of-life. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3
      improved symptoms and increased rectal pain thresholds. Symptom improvement
      correlated with a rise in morning melatonin, significant in males and subjects
      with normal circadian rhythm. This suggests that probiotics may act by
      influencing melatonin production, hence modulating IBS symptoms, in individuals
      with a normal circadian rhythm.

TI  - Perception of lactose intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome patients.
PG  - 1167-75
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000089 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The importance of lactose malabsorption in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) is not well defined and these patients often complain of lactose
      intolerance. To objectively measure lactose malabsorption, a hydrogen breath test
      (HBT) can be performed, but a discrepancy emerges between the results of the HBT 
      and the symptomatic response during the HBT. AIMS: To determine in a group of IBS
      patients whether self-perceived lactose intolerance and the symptomatic response 
      to lactose HBT were conditioned by other factors besides the presence of lactose 
      malabsorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral challenge to lactose (50 g) was tested
      in 51 IBS patients to assess HBT malabsorption and the symptomatic response to
      lactose intolerance was scored on a validated questionnaire. Allergological
      screening for common inhalants and food allergens (including cow's milk) was
      performed. The presence of psychological factors (e.g. anxiety, depression,
      fatigue) was evaluated using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 21 out
      of 51 patients (41.1%) were self-perceived to be lactose intolerant, 24/51 (47%) 
      had a positive HBT, and 14/51 (27.4%) presented with symptoms of lactose
      intolerance during HBT. The serological screening for inhalant and food allergens
      was positive in 6/21 (28.6%) and 4/21 (19%) of patients who self-perceived
      lactose intolerance and in 5/14 (37.5%) and 3/14 (21.4%) in intolerant patients
      symptomatic during HBT. Only 1/51 (1.9%) presented evidence of IgE-mediated
      hypersensitivity to cow's milk. Patients who experienced symptoms of lactose
      intolerance during HBT presented more severe IBS symptoms [326 (296-398) vs. 215 
      (126-295) P=0.05] and a higher score of anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Factors
      influencing the symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT resulted in an
      increase in hydrogen produced and in the severity of IBS. CONCLUSION: In a cohort
      of 51 IBS patients, the symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT were
      influenced by the capacity to absorb lactose and the severity of IBS. Other
      factors, such as the psychological status or an adverse reaction to milk, merit
      consideration as potential cofactors involved in lactose perception and
      tolerance.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: contemporary nutrition management strategies.
PG  - 781-99
LID - 10.1177/0148607114545329 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a complex disorder whose pathophysiology involves
      alterations in the enteric microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, gut
      immune/barrier function, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation,
      neurotransmitters, stress response, psychological factors, and more. The
      importance of diet in the management of irritable bowel syndrome has taken center
      stage in recent times as the literature validates the relationship of certain
      foods with the provocation of symptoms. Likewise, a number of elimination dietary
      programs have been successful in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
      Knowledge of the dietary management strategies for irritable bowel syndrome will 
      help guide nutritionists and healthcare practitioners to deliver optimal
      outcomes. This tutorial reviews the nutrition management strategies for irritable
      bowel syndrome.

      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated suspected food intolerances in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for
      real-time visualization of structural/functional changes in the intestinal mucosa
      after food challenge. Patients with functional changes after food challenge
      (CLE+) were placed on personalized exclusion diets and followed up for long-term 
      symptom relief. METHODS: Thirty-six IBS patients with suspected food intolerance 
      and 10 patients with Barrett's esophagus (controls) without IBS symptoms were
      examined by CLE at University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany).
      Diluted food antigens were administered directly to the duodenal mucosa through
      the working channel of the endoscope. Epithelial breaks, intervillous spaces, and
      the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were measured before and after
      the food challenge. CLE+ patients were placed on exclusion diets, given symptom
      score questionnaires, and followed up for 1 year; controls resumed their previous
      diet. RESULTS: CLE showed a real-time response to food antigens in 22 of 36
      patients; no responses were observed in 14 of 36 patients (CLE-) or any of the
      controls. Baseline IELs were significantly higher in CLE+ than CLE- subjects (P =
      .004); numbers increased significantly after food challenge (P = .0008). Within 5
      minutes of exposure of CLE+ patients to food antigens, IELs increased, epithelial
      leaks/gaps formed, and intervillous spaces widened. Epithelial leaks and
      intervillous spaces also increased significantly in CLE+ vs baseline (both P <
      .001). The concordance of IELs measured by CLE and conventional histology was
      70.6%; they did not correlate (P = .89; r(2) = 0.027). Symptom scores improved
      more than 50% in CLE+ patients after a 4-week exclusion diet and increased to 74%
      at 12 months; symptoms continued in CLE- patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CLE
      analysis of IBS patients with a suspected food intolerance, exposure to candidate
      food antigens caused immediate breaks, increased intervillous spaces, and
      increased IELs in the intestinal mucosa. These changes are associated with
      patient responses to exclusion diets. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder without any
      structural or metabolic abnormalities that sufficiently explain the symptoms,
      which include abdominal pain and discomfort, and bowel habit changes such as
      diarrhea and constipation. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial: visceral
      hypersensitivity, dysmotility, psychosocial factors, genetic or environmental
      factors, dysregulation of the brain-gut axis, and altered intestinal microbiota
      have all been proposed as possible causes. The human intestinal microbiota are
      composed of more than 1000 different bacterial species and 10(14) cells, and are 
      essential for the development, function, and homeostasis of the intestine, and
      for individual health. The putative mechanisms that explain the role of
      microbiota in the development of IBS include altered composition or metabolic
      activity of the microbiota, mucosal immune activation and inflammation, increased
      intestinal permeability and impaired mucosal barrier function, sensory-motor
      disturbances provoked by the microbiota, and a disturbed gut-microbiota-brain
      axis. Therefore, modulation of the intestinal microbiota through dietary changes,
      and use of antibiotics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents has been
      suggested as strategies for managing IBS symptoms. This review summarizes and
      discusses the accumulating evidence that intestinal microbiota play a role in the
      pathophysiology and management of IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders in Western countries. Despite the high prevalence of this disorders,
      the therapeutic management of these patients is often unsatisfactory. A number of
      factors have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS, including 
      impaired motility and sensitivity, increased permeability, changes in the gut
      microbiome and alterations in the brain-gut axis. Also food seems to play a
      critical role: the most of IBS patients report the onset or the exacerbation of
      their symptoms after the meals. Recently, an increasing attention has been paid
      to the role of food in IBS. In this review we summarize the most recent evidences
      about the role of diet on IBS symptoms. A diet restricted in fermentable, poorly 
      absorbed carbohydrates and sugar alcohols has beneficial effects on IBS symptoms.
      More studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the relationship between
      food and IBS. However, in the foreseeable future, dietary strategies will
      represent one of the key tools in the therapeutic management of patients with
      IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an intestinal functional disorder with the
      highest prevalence in the industrialized world. The intestinal microbiota (IM)
      plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and is not merely a consequence of this
      disorder. Previous research efforts have not revealed unequivocal microbiological
      signatures of IBS, and the experimental results are contradictory. The
      experimental methodologies adopted to investigate the complex intestinal
      ecosystem drastically impact the quality and significance of the results.
      Therefore, to consider the methodological aspects of the research on IM in IBS,
      we reviewed 29 relevant original research articles identified through a PubMed
      search using three combinations of keywords: "irritable bowel syndrome +
      microflora", "irritable bowel syndrome + microbiota" and "irritable bowel
      syndrome + microbiome". For each study, we reviewed the quality and significance 
      of the scientific evidence obtained with respect to the experimental method
      adopted. The data obtained from each study were compared with all considered
      publications to identify potential inconsistencies and explain contradictory
      results. The analytical revision of the studies referenced in the present review 
      has contributed to the identification of microbial groups whose relative
      abundance significantly alters IBS, suggesting that these microbial groups could 
      be IM signatures for this syndrome. The identification of microbial biomarkers in
      the IM can be advantageous for the development of new diagnostic tools and novel 
      therapeutic strategies for the treatment of different subtypes of IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders causing patients to seek medical treatment. It is relatively resource
      intensive and the source of significant morbidity. Recent insights into the
      pathophysiology and treatment of IBS has given clinicians more options than ever 
      to contend with this disorder. The purpose of our paper is to review older,
      "classic" treatments for IBS as well as newer agents and "alternative" therapies.
      We discuss the evidence base of these drugs and provide context to help develop
      appropriate treatment plans for IBS patients.

TI  - The effect of fiber supplementation on irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1367-74
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.195 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fiber has been used for many years to treat irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS). This approach had fallen out of favor until a recent resurgence, which was
      based on new randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that suggested it might be
      effective. We have previously conducted a systematic review of fiber in IBS, but 
      new RCT data for fiber therapy necessitate a new analysis; thus, we have
      conducted a systematic review of this intervention. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
      the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched up to December 2013. Trials
      recruiting adults with IBS, which compared fiber supplements with placebo,
      control therapy, or "usual management", were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data
      were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy
      as well as number needed to treat (NNT) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
      RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs involving 906 patients that had evaluated fiber in
      IBS. There was a significant benefit of fiber in IBS (RR=0.86; 95% CI 0.80-0.94
      with an NNT=10; 95% CI=6-33). There was no significant heterogeneity between
      results (I(2)=0%, Cochran Q=13.85 (d.f.=14), P=0.46). The benefit was only seen
      in RCTs on soluble fiber (RR=0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.94 with an NNT=7; 95% CI 4-25)
      with no effect seen with bran (RR=0.90; 95% CI 0.79-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Soluble
      fiber is effective in treating IBS. Bran did not appear to be of benefit,
      although we did not uncover any evidence of harm from this intervention, as
      others have speculated from uncontrolled data.

TI  - Efficacy of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in irritable bowel syndrome
      and chronic idiopathic constipation: systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1547-61; quiz 1546, 1562
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.202 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC) are functional bowel disorders. Evidence suggests that disturbance in the
      gastrointestinal microbiota may be implicated in both conditions. We performed a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of prebiotics,
      probiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and CIC. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (up to December 2013).
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with IBS or CIC, which
      compared prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics with placebo or no therapy, were
      eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of 
      remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
      Continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference with
      a 95% CI. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3,216 citations. Forty-three
      RCTs were eligible for inclusion. The RR of IBS symptoms persisting with
      probiotics vs. placebo was 0.79 (95% CI 0.70-0.89). Probiotics had beneficial
      effects on global IBS, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence scores. Data for 
      prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS were sparse. Probiotics appeared to have
      beneficial effects in CIC (mean increase in number of stools per week=1.49; 95%
      CI=1.02-1.96), but there were only two RCTs. Synbiotics also appeared beneficial 
      (RR of failure to respond to therapy=0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.92). Again, trials for
      prebiotics were few in number, and no definite conclusions could be drawn.
      CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are effective treatments for IBS, although which
      individual species and strains are the most beneficial remains unclear. Further
      evidence is required before the role of prebiotics or synbiotics in IBS is known.
      The efficacy of all three therapies in CIC is also uncertain.

PG  - 399
LID - 10.1007/s11894-014-0399-8 [doi]
AB  - Diarrheal disease, which is most often caused by infectious pathogens, is a
      significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children.
      This is particularly true in developing countries. Recent outbreaks of infectious
      diarrhea in developed countries, including the USA, are often attributed to food 
      handling and distribution practices and highlight the need for continued
      vigilance in this area. Another common cause of infectious diarrhea, Clostridium 
      difficile infection (CDI), has historically been associated with the use of
      antibiotics and exposure to a health-care setting but is now increasingly common 
      in the community in persons who lack the typical risk factors. Recent scientific 
      advances have also led to new and proposed new therapies for infectious diarrhea,
      including fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for recurrent C. difficile infection 
      (RCDI), probiotics for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and
      CDI, and the use of zinc supplementation in the treatment of acute diarrhea in
      children. Other therapies that have been in use for decades, such as the oral
      rehydration solution (ORS), continue to be the targets of scientific advancement 
      in an effort to improve delivery and efficacy. Finally, post-infectious irritable
      bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is an increasingly recognized occurrence. Attempts to
      understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon are underway and may provide
      insight into potential treatment options.

PG  - 357-75
LID - 10.1146/annurev-nutr-071813-105322 [doi]
AB  - Plasma levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols, the lipoproteins that
      transport them, and proteins involved in their absorption from the intestinal
      lumen fluctuate in a circadian manner. These changes are likely controlled by
      clock genes expressed in the intestine that are probably synchronized by neuronal
      and humoral signals from the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which constitute a master
      clock entrained by light signals from the eyes and from the environment, e.g.,
      food availability. Acute changes in circadian rhythms--e.g., due to
      nonsynchronous work schedules or a transcontinental flight--may trigger
      intestinal discomfort. Chronic disruptions in circadian control mechanisms may
      predispose the individual to irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, and peptic ulcer disease. A more detailed understanding of the molecular
      mechanisms underlying temporal changes in intestinal activity might allow us to
      identify novel targets for developing therapeutic approaches to these disorders.

AB  - AIM: To determine the dose-related effects of a novel probiotic combination,
      I.31, on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related quality of life (IBS-QoL).
      METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention
      clinical trial with three parallel arms was designed. A total of 84 patients (53 
      female, 31 male; age range 20-70 years) with IBS and diarrhea according to
      Rome-III criteria were randomly allocated to receive one capsule a day for 6 wk
      containing: (1) I.31 high dose (n = 28); (2) I.31 low dose (n = 27); and (3)
      placebo (n = 29). At baseline, and 3 and 6 wk of treatment, patients filled the
      IBSQoL, Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI), and global symptom relief
      questionnaires. RESULTS: During treatment, IBS-QoL increased in all groups, but
      this increment was significantly larger in patients treated with I.31 than in
      those receiving placebo (P = 0.008). After 6 wk of treatment, IBS-QoL increased
      by 18 +/- 3 and 22 +/- 4 points in the high and the low dose groups, respectively
      (P = 0.041 and P = 0.023 vs placebo), but only 9 +/- 3 in the placebo group.
      Gut-specific anxiety, as measured with VSI, also showed a significantly greater
      improvement after 6 wk of treatment in patients treated with probiotics (by 10
      +/- 2 and 14 +/- 2 points, high and low dose respectively, P < 0.05 for both vs 7
      +/- 1 score increment in placebo). Symptom relief showed no significant changes
      between groups. No adverse drug reactions were reported following the consumption
      of probiotic or placebo capsules. CONCLUSION: A new combination of three
      different probiotic bacteria was superior to placebo in improving IBS-related
      quality of life in patients with IBS and diarrhea.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides,
      Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet reduces symptoms of IBS, but reduction of
      potential prebiotic and fermentative effects might adversely affect the colonic
      microenvironment. The effects of a low FODMAP diet with a typical Australian diet
      on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a single-blinded, randomised,
      cross-over trial. DESIGN: Twenty-seven IBS and six healthy subjects were randomly
      allocated one of two 21-day provided diets, differing only in FODMAP content
      (mean (95% CI) low 3.05 (1.86 to 4.25) g/day vs Australian 23.7 (16.9 to 30.6)
      g/day), and then crossed over to the other diet with >/=21-day washout period.
      Faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on their habitual diet and from day 17 to day
      21 of the interventional diets were pooled, and pH, short-chain fatty acid
      concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed. RESULTS:
      Faecal indices were similar in IBS and healthy subjects during habitual diets.
      The low FODMAP diet was associated with higher faecal pH (7.37 (7.23 to 7.51) vs.
      7.16 (7.02 to 7.30); p=0.001), similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations,
      greater microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance (9.63 (9.53 to 
      9.73) vs. 9.83 (9.72 to 9.93) log10 copies/g; p<0.001) compared with the
      Australian diet. To indicate direction of change, in comparison with the habitual
      diet the low FODMAP diet reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical
      Australian diet increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing Clostridium
      cluster XIVa (median ratio 6.62; p<0.001) and mucus-associated Akkermansia
      muciniphila (19.3; p<0.001), and reduced Ruminococcus torques. CONCLUSIONS: Diets
      differing in FODMAP content have marked effects on gut microbiota composition.
      The implications of long-term reduction of intake of FODMAPs require elucidation.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that host-microbe interactions play a key role in
      maintaining homeostasis. Alterations in gut microbial composition is associated
      with marked changes in behaviors relevant to mood, pain and cognition,
      establishing the critical importance of the bi-directional pathway of
      communication between the microbiota and the brain in health and disease.
      Dysfunction of the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been implicated in
      stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome
      and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Bacterial colonization of the
      gut is central to postnatal development and maturation of key systems that have
      the capacity to influence central nervous system (CNS) programming and signaling,
      including the immune and endocrine systems. Moreover, there is now expanding
      evidence for the view that enteric microbiota plays a role in early programming
      and later response to acute and chronic stress. This view is supported by studies
      in germ-free mice and in animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections,
      probiotic agents or antibiotics. Although communication between gut microbiota
      and the CNS are not fully elucidated, neural, hormonal, immune and metabolic
      pathways have been suggested. Thus, the concept of a microbiome-brain-gut axis is
      emerging, suggesting microbiota-modulating strategies may be a tractable
      therapeutic approach for developing novel treatments for CNS disorders.

PG  - 1593-609
LID - 10.1517/14712598.2014.937419 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Saccharomyces boulardii is a well-known probiotic worldwide, and
      there are numerous studies including experimental and clinical trials in children
      and adults by the use of S. boulardii. AREAS COVERED: The objective of the
      present report is to provide an update on the evidence for the efficacy of S.
      boulardii CNCM I-745 in different clinical conditions. Saccharomyces boulardii is
      one of the best-studied probiotics in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and is shown to
      be safe and to reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization by about 1
      day. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the recommended probiotics for AGE in
      children by European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).
      Saccharomyces boulardii is also a recommended probiotic for the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and a recent study showed promising results
      for the treatment of AAD in children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend
      the long-term use of S. boulardii in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
      Although some clinical studies showed positive effects of S. boulardii on
      inflammation, there is no clinical evidence that S. boulardii is useful in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Saccharomyces boulardii could be used in patients
      needing Helicobacter pylori eradication because the S. boulardii improves
      compliance, decreases the side effects and moderately increases the eradication
      rate. There are new promising results (improving feeding tolerance, shorten the
      course of hyperbilirubinemia), but we do still not recommend the routine use of
      S. boulardii in newborns. EXPERT OPINION: Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a
      good example for the statement that each probiotic needs to be taxonomically
      characterized and its efficacy and safety should be documented individually in
      different clinical settings.

TI  - Patient perception of treatment burden is high in celiac disease compared with
      other common conditions.
PG  - 1304-11
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.29 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is life-long adherence to 
      a gluten-free diet (GFD). Noncompliance is associated with signs and symptoms of 
      CD, yet long-term adherence rates are poor. It is not known how the burden of the
      GFD compares with other medical treatments, and there are limited data on the
      socioeconomic factors influencing treatment adherence. In this study, we compared
      treatment burden and health state in CD compared with other chronic illnesses and
      evaluated the relationship between treatment burden and adherence. METHODS:
      Survey was mailed to participants with CD, gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension (HTN),
      diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD) on dialysis. Surveys included demographic information and visual analog
      scales measuring treatment burden, importance of treatment, disease-specific
      health status, and overall health status. RESULTS: We collected surveys from 341 
      celiac and 368 non-celiac participants. Celiac participants reported high
      treatment burden, greater than participants with GERD or HTN and comparable to
      ESRD. Conversely, patients with CD reported the highest health state of all
      groups. Factors associated with high treatment burden in CD included poor
      adherence, concern regarding food cost, eating outside the home, higher income,
      lack of college education, and time limitations in preparing food. Poor adherence
      in CD was associated with increased symptoms, income, and low perceived
      importance of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with CD have high treatment
      burden but also excellent overall health status in comparison with other chronic 
      medical conditions. The significant burden of dietary therapy for CD argues for
      the need for safe adjuvant treatment, as well as interventions designed to lower 
      the perceived burden of the GFD.

TI  - Therapeutic effects, tolerability and safety of a multi-strain probiotic in
      Iranian adults with irritable bowel syndrome and bloating.
PG  - 466-70
LID - 0141707/AIM.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in Iran with
      challenging treatment. Although trials have suggested that probiotics alleviate
      the complaints of patients with minimal side effects, they have not been
      investigated in Iranian adults. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind study, 108 
      eligible IBS patients (Rome III Criteria) aged 20 - 70 years who referred
      consecutively to a clinical center in Tehran with abdominal bloating from 2010 to
      2012 received a combination probiotics or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks. The
      objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multi-strain probiotics
      combination. One week prior to and throughout the treatment, the participants
      recorded their abdominal symptoms on a daily basis, using visual analogue scale
      and reported satisfactory relief of general symptoms at the end of each week.
      Adverse events were evaluated by self-reporting and physical examination.
      Continuous variables were analyzed by independent t-test and chi-square was used 
      for binomials. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were balanced (60% female,
      mean age 36.7 +/- 11.5). A total of 97 (51 intervention, 46 control) completed
      the treatment. Intention to treat analysis was done on 108 allocated subjects.
      85% of the probiotic group reported satisfactory relief of general symptoms
      compared with 47% in the control group (P < 0.01). A reduction in abdominal
      bloating and pain with probiotic was superior to placebo [-13.0 vs. -3.7 (P <
      0.01), -8.2 vs. -2.1 (P = 0.02), respectively]. No severe adverse drug reaction
      was seen in either group. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week period of treatment with the
      combination probiotics twice daily was safe, well tolerated, and effective in our
      patients. Further investigation is recommended for other subgroups of IBS. Trial 
      Registration: IRCT.ir IRCT2012071010230N1.

PG  - 7587-601
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i24.7587 [doi]
AB  - Breath tests are non-invasive tests and can detect H(2) and CH(4) gases which are
      produced by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed intestinal carbohydrate and are 
      excreted in the breath. These tests are used in the diagnosis of carbohydrate
      malabsorption, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and for measuring the
      orocecal transit time. Malabsorption of carbohydrates is a key trigger of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms such as diarrhea and/or
      constipation, bloating, excess flatulence, headaches and lack of energy.
      Abdominal bloating is a common nonspecific symptom which can negatively impact
      quality of life. It may reflect dietary imbalance, such as excess fiber intake,
      or may be a manifestation of IBS. However, bloating may also represent small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients with persistent symptoms of abdominal
      bloating and distension despite dietary interventions should be referred for H(2)
      breath testing to determine the presence or absence of bacterial overgrowth. If
      bacterial overgrowth is identified, patients are typically treated with
      antibiotics. Evaluation of IBS generally includes testing of other disorders that
      cause similar symptoms. Carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose, fructose, sorbitol) 
      can cause abdominal fullness, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and
      diarrhea, which are similar to the symptoms of IBS. However, it is unclear if
      these digestive disorders contribute to or cause the symptoms of IBS. Research
      studies show that a proper diagnosis and effective dietary intervention
      significantly reduces the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in 
      IBS. Thus, diagnosis of malabsorption of these carbohydrates in IBS using a
      breath test is very important to guide the clinician in the proper treatment of
      IBS patients.

TI  - Chronic bacterial prostatitis and irritable bowel syndrome: effectiveness of
      treatment with rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3.

AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of treatment with rifaximin
      followed by the probiotic VSL#3 versus no treatment on the progression of chronic
      prostatitis toward chronic microbial prostate-vesiculitis (PV) or
      prostate-vesiculo-epididymitis (PVE). A total of 106 selected infertile male
      patients with bacteriologically cured chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were randomly prescribed rifaximin (200 mg, 2
      tablets bid, for 7 days monthly for 12 months) and probiotic containing multiple 
      strains VSL#3 (450 x 10(9) FU per day) or no treatment. Ninety-five of them
      (89.6%) complied with the therapeutic plan and were included in this study. Group
      A = "6Tx/6-": treatment for the initial 6 and no treatment for the following 6
      months (n = 26); Group B = "12Tx": 12 months of treatment (n = 22); Group C =
      "6-/6Tx": no treatment for the initial 6 months and treatment in the last 6
      months (n = 23); Group D = "12-": no treatment (n = 24). The patients of Groups A
      = "6Tx/6-" and B = "12Tx" had the highest frequency of chronic prostatitis (88.5%
      and 86.4%, respectively). In contrast, group "12-": patients had the lowest
      frequency of prostatitis (33.4%). The progression of prostatitis into PV in
      groups "6Tx/6-" (15.5%) and "6-/6Tx" (13.6%) was lower than that found in the
      patients of group "12-" (45.8%). Finally, no patient of groups "6Tx/6-" and
      "6-/6Tx" had PVE, whereas it was diagnosed in 20.8% of group "12-" patients.
      Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in
      lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male
      accessory gland infections in infertile patients with bacteriologically cured CBP
      plus IBS.

TI  - [Estimation of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with
      constipation and diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 307-10
AB  - UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common reason for
      gastroenterology consultations. The diverse in symptomatology of the disease
      comes from its rich etiopathogenesis. Recently studies talk about infectious
      etiology of IBS and because of that it is necessary to expand its diagnostics by 
      small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) test. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with
      constipation (IBS-C) and diarrhea (IBS-D) irritable bowel syndrome with regard to
      nutrition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 46 subjects (33 women and 13
      men) in average age of 44 years, which were divided into two groups: diarrhea and
      constipation IBS. All patients underwent hydrogen breath test studying bacterial 
      overgrowth in the small intestine. In addition, each person had fulfilled a
      feeding questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student's t-test, Pearson test.
      RESULTS: It has been shown that there is no statistical significances between the
      prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrheal IBS and constipation IBS and gender.
      Average value of increments of hydrogen in breath during the test was higher in
      IBS-C in comparison with IBS-D, which was the highest in the intestine bacterial 
      overgrowth in patients with IBS-C. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS showed that there is no
      relationship between the type and frequency of consumption of milk, meat, fruit
      and vegetables, sweets and coffee and the prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrhea 
      and constipation IBS. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of constipation or diarrhea
      irritable bowel syndrome is not related to gender. SIBO is more common in
      patients with IBS-C than in IBS-D group. There is no relationship between the
      type of food consumed and the amount of SIBO in people with IBS. Type of food
      intake do not affect the status of the intestinal flora of people with IBS.

PG  - 6832-43
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i22.6832 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of the probiotic combination Lactibiane
      Tolerance((R)) (LT) on epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. METHODS:
      The effect of the multispecies probiotic LT was assessed on several models of
      epithelial barrier function both in vitro (in basal and inflammatory conditions) 
      and in vivo [visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress or by colonic
      perfusion of a fecal supernatant (FSN) from patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS)]. In vitro, we measured the permeability of confluent T84 cell
      monolayers incubated with or without LT by evaluating the paracellular flux of
      macromolecules, in basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) or with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM). 
      In vivo, male C57/Bl6 mice received orally NaCl or LT for 15 d and were submitted
      to water avoidance stress (WAS) before evaluating visceral sensitivity by
      measuring the myoelectrical activity of the abdominal muscle and the paracellular
      permeability with (51)Cr-EDTA. Permeability and sensitivity were also measured
      after colonic instillation of FSN. Tight-junctions were assessed by
      immunoblotting and TLR-4 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry
      RESULTS: Incubation of T84 cell monolayers with LT in basal conditions had no
      significant effect on permeability (P > 0.05 vs culture medium). By contrast,
      addition of LT bacterial bodies (LT) completely prevented the LPS-induced
      increase in paracellular permeability (P < 0.01 vs LPS 10 ng/mL (LPS 10); P <
      0.01 vs LPS 100 ng/mL (LPS 100), P > 0.05 vs culture medium). The effect was dose
      dependent as addition of 10(9) LT bacterial bodies induced a stronger decrease in
      absorbance than 10(6) LT (10(9) LT + LPS 10: -20.1% +/- 13.4, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10;
      10(6) LT + LPS 10: -11.6% +/- 6.2, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 10(9) LT + LPS 100: -14.4%
      +/- 5.5, P < 0.01 vs LPS 100; 10(6) LT + LPS 100: -11.6% +/- 7.3, P < 0.05 vs LPS
      100). Moreover, the increase in paracellular permeability induced by culturing
      T84 cells with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM) 
      was completely inhibited in the presence of 10(9) LT (P < 0.01 vs IBS-CM). LT
      also significantly prevented the epithelial disruption induced by intracolonic
      infusion of fecal supernatant from IBS patients (P < 0.01 vs IBS FSN) or water
      avoidance stress P < 0.01 vs WAS) in C57/Bl6 mice and increased the expression of
      occludin in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by immnunoblotting. The WAS-induced
      effect on visceral sensitivity was prevented by LT treatment since values
      obtained for all steps of colorectal distension were significantly (P < 0.01)
      different from the WAS group. Finally, LT down-regulated the response mediated
      through TLR-4 in vitro (decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in
      response to LPS: -65.8% for 10(9) LT and -52.5% for 10(6) LT, P < 0.01 vs LPS)
      and in vivo (inhibition of WAS induced an increase in TLR-4 expression in the LT 
      treated mice colon, P < 0.01 vs WAS). CONCLUSION: The probiotic LT mix prevented 
      the disruption to the epithelial barrier induced by LPS, stress or colonic
      soluble factors from IBS patients and prevented visceral hypersensitivity.

      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 392-402
LID - 10.1111/apt.12842 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal
      integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIMS: To
      assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on
      mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential
      differences between healthy controls and IBS patients. METHODS: Fifteen IBS
      patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind
      placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test
      and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after
      ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic
      metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: 5-HTP administration
      significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in
      both healthy controls (7.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P 
      = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 +/- 4.8 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs.
      placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger
      increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after
      administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by
      redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the
      barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly
      lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in
      occludin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT 
      metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was
      seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the
      presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier 
      function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients.

TI  - Interaction between ingested nutrients and gut endocrine cells in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (review).
PG  - 363-71
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1811 [doi]
AB  - Several endocrine cell abnormalities have been reported in different segments of 
      the gastrointestinal tract of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These
      cells have specialized microvilli that project into the lumen; they function as
      sensors for the gut contents and respond to luminal stimuli (mostly ingested
      nutrients) by releasing hormones into the lamina propria, where they exert their 
      effects via a paracrine/endocrine mode of action. Certain food items trigger the 
      symptoms experienced by IBS patients, including those rich in fermentable oligo-,
      di- and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In this review, we present the
      argument that the effects of both FODMAPs and the proportional intake of
      proteins, fats and carbohydrates on IBS symptoms may be caused by an interaction 
      with the gut endocrine cells. Since the gut hormones control and regulate
      gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this interaction may be responsible for 
      abnormal gastrointestinal motility and the visceral hypersensitivity observed in 
      these patients. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from
      food allergy. The role of gluten intolerance in the development of IBS symptoms
      in these patients remains a matter of controversy. Individual guidance on food
      management, which includes restrictions in the intake of FODMAP-rich foods and
      testing diets with different proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates has 
      been found to reduce the symptoms, improve the quality of life, and make the
      habitual diet of IBS patients more healthy.

TI  - Linaclotide: a novel agent for chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1081-91
LID - 10.2146/ajhp130575 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmaco-kinetics, and clinical efficacy and safety of
      linaclotide in the management of chronic constipation (CC) and
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) are reviewed. SUMMARY: 
      Linaclotide (Linzess, Forest Pharmaceuticals) is a 14-amino acid peptide
      indicated for the treatment of adults with CC and IBS-C. Linaclotide acts on
      guanylate cyclase-C receptors on the luminal membrane to increase chloride and
      bicarbonate secretions into the intestine and inhibit the absorption of sodium
      ions, thus increasing the secretion of water into the lumen and improving
      defecation; the drug is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation.
      Linaclotide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for oral
      once-daily administration at doses of 145 mug for CC and 290 mug for IBS-C. In
      placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials, linaclotide significantly increased
      weekly spontaneous bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements
      (CSBMs) while reducing abdominal pain in patients with CC. In patients with
      IBS-C, linaclotide was demonstrated to be effective in meeting FDA-recommended
      endpoints such as reductions of at least 30% from baseline in abdominal pain
      scores and CSBM frequency. The most common adverse effect of linaclotide is
      diarrhea, which was reported in 16-20% of clinical trial participants.
      CONCLUSION: Linaclotide is an important advance in the treatment of CC and IBS-C,
      with a novel mechanism of action resulting in accelerated intestinal transit. In 
      clinical trials, linaclotide demonstrated efficacy relative to placebo for
      treatment of both CC and IBS-C. Linaclotide's adverse effects are generally mild 
      and confined to the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota: current clinical applications and
      future perspectives.
PG  - 762-70
AB  - Human beings and gut microbiota are in a symbiotic relationship, and the
      hypothesis of a "super organism" composed of the human organism and microbes has 
      been recently proposed. The gut microbiota fulfills important metabolic and
      immunological tasks, and the impairment of its composition might alter
      homeostasis and lead to the development of microbiota-related diseases. The most 
      common illnesses associated with alterations of the gut microbiota include
      inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteric infections, irritable bowel syndrome
      and other gastrointestinal functional diseases, colorectal cancer, metabolic
      syndrome and obesity, liver diseases, allergic diseases, and neurological
      diseases such as autism. In theory, every disease associated with the impairment 
      of intestinal microflora might benefit from the therapeutic modulation of the gut
      microbiota. A number of attempts to manipulate the microbiota have not produced
      identical results for every disease. Although antibiotics and probiotics have
      been available for a long time, the so-called fecal microbiota transplantation,
      which is a very old remedy, was only recently re-evaluated as a promising
      therapeutic approach for microbiota impairment. A comprehensive understanding of 
      the gut microbiota composition, in states of both health and various diseases, is
      needed for the development of future approaches for microbiota modulation and for
      developing targeted therapies. In this review, we describe the role of the
      microbiota in several diseases and the related treatment options that are
      currently available.

LID - 10.1007/s00482-014-1406-6 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      diseases. It is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, typically associated
      with altered bowel habits that cannot be explained by structural abnormalities in
      routine diagnostic workup. Based on the predominant symptom, IBS can be divided
      into different subtypes: IBS with predominant constipation, diarrhea, bloating,
      or pain. Knowledge about the complex and multifactorial IBS pathophysiology has
      increased tremendously in recent years, e.g., IBS may be related to alterations
      in gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, and the mucosal immune
      system. It is important, both for the patient and the physician, that IBS
      diagnosis is made quickly and thoroughly based on the typical symptom complex and
      exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses and to reassure the patient that IBS
      is a chronic, but benign disease. These components are the fundamental basis for 
      a good patient-physician relationship and for a successful long-term management
      of this potentially very compromising disorder. IBS therapy is based on general
      measures as well as symptom-oriented medical therapy, where improvement of
      abdominal pain is one of the main goals in treating IBS patients. Several pain
      treatment options are available, which may be used long-term or on demand and
      which may be combined with other therapies. General medical approaches include
      antispasmodics, improvement of bowel function, phytotherapy, and probiotics.
      Especially in patients with psychological comorbidities, antidepressants may be
      used. Modern drug treatments include the GC-C agonist linaclotide in IBS with
      predominant constipation, the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in IBS with
      bloating, and 5-HT3 antagonists in IBS with predominant diarrhea. Psychotherapy
      should be included in an interdisciplinary approach in refractory cases or in
      psychological comorbidity.

      non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

LID - 10.1186/1741-7015-12-85 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome
      with several unsettled issues despite the increasing awareness of its existence. 
      We carried out a prospective survey on NCGS in Italian centers for the diagnosis 
      of gluten-related disorders, with the aim of defining the clinical picture of
      this new syndrome and to establish roughly its prevalence compared with celiac
      disease. METHODS: From November 2012 to October 2013, 38 Italian centers (27
      adult gastroenterology, 5 internal medicine, 4 pediatrics, and 2 allergy)
      participated in this prospective survey. A questionnaire was used in order to
      allow uniform and accurate collection of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental 
      data. RESULTS: In total, 486 patients with suspected NCGS were identified in this
      1-year period. The female/male ratio was 5.4 to 1, and the mean age was 38 years 
      (range 3-81). The clinical picture was characterized by combined gastrointestinal
      (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain,
      gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and systemic manifestations
      (tiredness, headache, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      'foggy mind,' dermatitis or skin rash, depression, anxiety, and anemia). In the
      large majority of patients, the time lapse between gluten ingestion and the
      appearance of symptoms varied from a few hours to 1 day. The most frequent
      associated disorders were irritable bowel syndrome (47%), food intolerance (35%) 
      and IgE-mediated allergy (22%). An associated autoimmune disease was detected in 
      14% of cases. Regarding family history, 18% of our patients had a relative with
      celiac disease, but no correlation was found between NCGS and positivity for
      HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 25% of the patients
      tested. Only a proportion of patients underwent duodenal biopsy; for those that
      did, the biopsies showed normal intestinal mucosa (69%) or mild increase in
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (31%). The ratio between suspected NCGS and new CD
      diagnoses, assessed in 28 of the participating centers, was 1.15 to 1.
      CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey shows that NCGS has a strong correlation
      with female gender and adult age. Based on our results, the prevalence of NCGS
      seems to be only slightly higher than that of celiac disease.

AB  - Psychological stress is known to induce somatic symptoms. Classically, many gut
      physiological responses to stress are mediated by the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is, however, a growing body of
      evidence of stress-induced corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) release causing 
      bowel dysfunction through multiple pathways, either through the HPA axis, the
      autonomic nervous systems, or directly on the bowel itself. In addition, recent
      findings of CRF influencing the composition of gut microbiota lend support for
      the use of probiotics, antibiotics, and other microbiota-altering agents as
      potential therapeutic measures in stress-induced bowel dysfunction.

      treatment.
PG  - 6013-23
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i20.6013 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain
      (RAP) in children in both more developed and developing parts of the world. It is
      defined by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is
      characterized by abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and whose onset is
      associated with a change in stool form and or frequency and is not explained by
      structural or biochemical abnormalities. It is estimated that 10%-15% of older
      children and adolescents suffer from IBS. IBS can be considered to be a brain-gut
      disorder possibly due to complex interaction between environmental and hereditary
      factors. The diagnosis of IBS is made based on the Rome III criteria together
      with ruling out organic causes of RAP in children such as inflammatory bowel
      disease and celiac disease. Once the diagnosis of IBS is made, it is important to
      explain to the parents (and children) that there is no serious underlying
      disease. This reassurance may be effective treatment in a large number of cases. 
      Lifestyle modifications, stress management, dietary interventions and probiotics 
      may be beneficial in some cases. Although there is limited evidence for efficacy 
      of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and antidiarrheals; these
      have a role in severe cases. Biopsychosocial therapies have shown encouraging
      results in initial trials but are beset by limited availability. Further research
      is necessary to understand the pathophysiology and provide specific focused
      therapies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorder that affects 15-20% of the Western population. BACKGROUND: There are
      currently few therapeutic options available for the treatment of IBS. The aim of 
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a medical device
      containing a combination of Simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in the treatment
      of IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a monocentric double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial. Adult subjects suffering from
      IBS as defined by Rome III criteria were enrolled. Bloating, discomfort,
      abdominal pain were assessed as primary end point. Subjects received the active
      treatment or placebo 3 time a day after each meal for 4 weeks of study period.
      Subjects were submitted to visit at Day 0 (T1), at Days 14 (T2) and 29 (T3).
      RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included into the study. Intragroup analysis
      showed a significant reduction of the bloating, discomfort and pain in Colinox(R)
      group (CG) compared to placebo group (PG). Between group analysis confirmed, at
      T1-T3, significant differences between CG and PG in bloating and discomfort.
      DISCUSSION: Simethicone is an inert antifoaming able to reduce bloating,
      abdominal discomfort. Literature offers increasing evidence linking alterations
      in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS and it is well known that probiotics
      are important to restore the native gut microbiota. The Colinox medical device is
      specifically targeted against most intrusive symptom of IBS (bloating) and it is 
      also able to counteract the most accredited ethiopathogenetic factor in IBS
      (alterations of intestinal microbiota). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy and
      safety of a combination of simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in treatment of
      IBS.

LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0966-7 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a
      challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain
      specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results
      in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit
      their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line
      therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have
      been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable 
      carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to
      reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence
      for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy 
      of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different
      quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint
      oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS.
      Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although 
      the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis.
      In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion
      stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist
      that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the
      stool pattern.

PG  - 5212-25
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i18.5212 [doi]
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the main pathogenic factor for upper
      digestive tract organic diseases. In addition to direct cytotoxic and
      proinflammatory effects, H. pylori infection may also induce abnormalities
      indirectly by affecting the brain-gut axis, similar to other microorganisms
      present in the alimentary tract. The brain-gut axis integrates the central,
      peripheral, enteric and autonomic nervous systems, as well as the endocrine and
      immunological systems, with gastrointestinal functions and environmental stimuli,
      including gastric and intestinal microbiota. The bidirectional relationship
      between H. pylori infection and the brain-gut axis influences both the contagion 
      process and the host's neuroendocrine-immunological reaction to it, resulting in 
      alterations in cognitive functions, food intake and appetite, immunological
      response, and modification of symptom sensitivity thresholds. Furthermore,
      disturbances in the upper and lower digestive tract permeability, motility and
      secretion can occur, mainly as a form of irritable bowel syndrome. Many of these 
      abnormalities disappear following H. pylori eradication. H. pylori may have
      direct neurotoxic effects that lead to alteration of the brain-gut axis through
      the activation of neurogenic inflammatory processes, or by microelement
      deficiency secondary to functional and morphological changes in the digestive
      tract. In digestive tissue, H. pylori can alter signaling in the brain-gut axis
      by mast cells, the main brain-gut axis effector, as H. pylori infection is
      associated with decreased mast cell infiltration in the digestive tract.
      Nevertheless, unequivocal data concerning the direct and immediate effect of H.
      pylori infection on the brain-gut axis are still lacking. Therefore, further
      studies evaluating the clinical importance of these host-bacteria interactions
      will improve our understanding of H. pylori infection pathophysiology and suggest
      new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - [The low FODMAP diet as a therapy for irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - A7407
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common, sometimes disabling disorder for
      which there is a lack of effective treatments. Many patients report that the
      make-up of the diet has an effect on their symptoms. The western diet consists of
      many different molecules. Some of them are small, fermentable and cannot be
      absorbed (FODMAPs). The low FODMAP diet was recently developed in Australia. In
      randomised controlled trials 37-45% of IBS patients experience symptom reduction 
      with this diet. The low FODMAP diet starts with a 6-week elimination phase. If
      symptoms decrease substantially, it is followed by a structured reintroduction
      phase of the various FODMAPs over several weeks, after which patients are left
      with a diet that is simpler to follow.

TI  - Analysis of free ACh and 5-HT in milk from four different species and their
      bioactivity on 5-HT(3) and nACh receptors.
PG  - 1489-94
LID - 10.1039/c3fo60458f [doi]
AB  - Milk is one of the most beneficial aliments and is highly recommended in normal
      conditions; however, in certain disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome, cow
      milk and dairy products worsen the gastric symptoms and their use is not
      recommended. Among the most recognized milk-induced gatrointestinal symptoms are 
      abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, which are processes controlled by
      cholinergic and serotonergic transmission. Whether the presence of bioavailable
      ACh and 5-HT in milk may contribute to normal peristalsis, or to the developing
      of these symptoms, is not known. In this work we attempt to determine whether the
      content of free ACh and 5-HT is of physiological significance in milk from four
      different species: cow (bovine), goat, camel and human. Liquid chromatography
      coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify 
      free ACh and 5-HT in milk, and activation of the serotonergic and cholinergic
      ionotropic receptors was investigated using electrophysiological experiments. Our
      principal hypothesis was that milk from these four species had sufficient free
      ACh and 5-HT to activate their correspondent receptors expressed in a
      heterologous system. Our results showed a more complex picture, in which free ACh
      and 5-HT and their ability to activate cholinergic and serotonergic receptors are
      not correlated. This work is a first step to elucidate whether 5-HT and ACh, at
      the concentrations present in the milk, can be associated to a direct function in
      the GI.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: A liquid multi-strain probiotic vs. placebo in the
      irritable bowel syndrome--a 12 week double-blind study.
PG  - 51-62
LID - 10.1111/apt.12787 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of interactions between the host and gut microbiota in
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is becoming increasingly
      apparent. Probiotics offer a potential new treatment for IBS, but current results
      are conflicting, largely as a result of poorly designed trials and
      nonstandardisation of outcome measures. AIM: To assess the efficacy of a liquid, 
      multi-strain probiotic (Symprove) in IBS. METHODS: A single-centre, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with symptomatic IBS.
      Patients received 12 weeks of treatment with the probiotic or placebo (1
      mL/kg/day). The primary efficacy measure was the difference in change in the IBS 
      symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) between probiotic vs. placebo at week 12.
      Secondary outcome measures included change in the IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL)
      score and change in the IBS-SSS symptom component scores. RESULTS: A total of 186
      patients were randomised and 152 patients completed the study. The mean change in
      IBS-SSS was -63.3 probiotic vs. -28.3 placebo. The mean difference in the IBS-SSS
      was statistically significant [-35.0 (95% CI; -62.03, -7.87); P = 0.01]. There
      was no significant improvement in the IBS-QOL. No serious adverse events were
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-strain probiotic was associated with a
      statistically significant improvement in overall symptom severity in patients
      with IBS, and was well tolerated. These results suggest this probiotic confers
      benefit in IBS and deserves further investigation (ISRCTN identifier: 77512412).

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms module: feasibility, reliability, and validity.
PG  - 347-55
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the measurement
      properties of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for
      patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages
      between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL 
      Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682
      parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic
      constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease).
      RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood,
      diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales
      evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores
      (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and
      good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report
      alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with
      the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales 
      known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor
      analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS:
      The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement
      properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in
      clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs
      and organic GI diseases.

TI  - Practical approaches to probiotics use.
PG  - 980-6
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2013-0490 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are microorganisms exerting beneficial effects on the host. They can
      be ingested through foods or supplements and their inclusion in these products is
      regulated in Canada by the Health Canada Health Products and Food Branch. The aim
      of this article is to summarize current evidence from randomized controlled
      trials and guidelines from Health Canada, the World Health Organization, and
      internationally recognized expert committees in the hope that it will help
      practitioners and professionals recommending probiotics to healthy and diseased
      patients, with a focus on the Canadian setting. From a general perspective,
      probiotics can be recommended for prevention of diseases that are associated to
      altered intestinal ecology. Specifically, they can be recommended for prevention 
      of upper respiratory tract infections and pouchitis, for prevention and
      management of necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial vaginosis and antibiotic
      associated diarrhea, including Clostridium difficile infection, and for treatment
      of atopic eczema in cow's milk allergy and of infectious diarrhea. Additional
      substantiated probiotic benefits include prevention of hypercholesterolemia,
      management of constipation, reduction of recurrent urinary tract infections,
      improvement of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and reduction of antibiotics
      side effects in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Because probiotics are generally
      recognized as safe and can be removed with antimicrobial agents, their use should
      be considered in patients of all ages.

TI  - A role for the gut microbiota in IBS.
PG  - 497-505
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2014.40 [doi]
AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion of knowledge regarding the vast
      microbial community that resides within our intestine-the gut microbiota. The
      topic has generated great expectations in terms of gaining a better understanding
      of disorders ranging from IBD to metabolic disorders and obesity. IBS is a
      condition for which investigators have long been in search of plausible
      underlying pathogeneses and it is inevitable that altered composition or function
      of the gut microbiota will be considered as a potential aetiological factor in at
      least a subset of patients with IBS. This Review describes the evidence
      implicating the gut microbiota in not only the expression of the intestinal
      manifestations of IBS, but also the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 
      80% of patients with IBS. The evidence described herein ranges from
      proof-of-concept studies in animals to observational studies and clinical trials 
      in humans. The gut microbiota is subject to influences from a diverse range of
      factors including diet, antibiotic usage, infection and stress. These factors
      have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS and further prompt 
      consideration of a role for the gut microbiota in IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now
      evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients,
      including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as 
      the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus
      lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many
      pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In
      this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in
      IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of
      DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a
      recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible
      Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin 
      levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as
      readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing
      evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight
      junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of
      recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L.
      lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects 
      in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters.
      Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a
      "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE
      system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at
      mucosal surfaces.

AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a disabling clinical condition of unknown cause,
      and only symptomatic treatment with limited benefit is available. Gluten
      sensitivity that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease (CD)
      is increasingly recognized as a frequent and treatable condition with a wide
      spectrum of manifestations that overlap with the manifestations of FM, including 
      chronic musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of 
      this report was to describe 20 selected patients with FM without CD who improved 
      when placed on a gluten-free diet. An anti-transglutaminase assay, duodenal
      biopsy, and HLA typing were performed in all cases. CD was ruled out by negative 
      anti-transglutaminase assay results and absence of villous atrophy in the
      duodenal biopsy. All patients had intraepithelial lymphocytosis without villous
      atrophy. Clinical response was defined as achieving at least one of the following
      scenarios: remission of FM pain criteria, return to work, return to normal life, 
      or the discontinuation of opioids. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range
      5-31). This observation supports the hypothesis that non-celiac gluten
      sensitivity may be an underlying cause of FM syndrome.

TI  - Cytokine and clinical response to Saccharomyces boulardii therapy in
      diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized trial.
PG  - 630-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000094 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects of the
      probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii on proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines in patients with diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).
      The other objectives were to document any clinical improvement as judged by
      symptoms, quality of life, and histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a
      randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in which S. boulardii, 750
      mg/day, or placebo was administered for 6 weeks in IBS-D patients, in addition to
      ispaghula husk standard treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients received S.
      boulardii and 35 patients received the placebo. As compared with placebo, the S. 
      boulardii group showed a significant decrease in blood and tissue levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (P<0.001) and an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels, as well as an
      increase in the tissue IL-10/IL-12 ratio (P<0.001). No significant change in the 
      blood and tissue levels of cytokines was found in the placebo group.
      Bowel-related IBS-D symptoms reported in the patients' daily diary improved in
      both groups. However, overall improvement in the quality of life was more marked 
      in the S. boulardii group. Although baseline histological findings were mild, an 
      improvement was observed in the probiotic group in the lymphocyte and neutrophil 
      infiltrates (P=0.017 and 0.018), epithelial mitosis (P=0.003), and
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.024). No serious adverse events were found in
      either group. CONCLUSION: S. boulardii with ispaghula husk was superior to
      placebo with ispaghula husk in improving the cytokine profile, histology, and
      quality of life of patients with IBS-D. These preliminary results need to be
      confirmed in a well-powered trial.

LID - 10.3928/00904481-20140325-08 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in children and adults. The
      pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IBS remains incompletely understood. The
      biopsychosocial model, which conceptualizes chronic pain as a dysregulation of
      the gut-brain-homeostasis with peripheral and central factors mutually
      influencing each other, is the most accepted framework to explain IBS. Twin and
      family aggregation studies suggest a genetic component that does not exclusively 
      explain the higher prevalence of IBS in certain families. Social learning
      (environmental factors) and maladaptive coping predispose children to develop IBS
      with greater disability and more frequent medical consultations. Early-life
      events constitute an additional risk factor for the development of IBS and other 
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Children with a history of cow's
      milk protein hypersensitivity or abdominal surgeries have a higher prevalence of 
      IBS and other FGIDs years later. IBS frequently follows an episode of acute
      gastrointestinal inflammation (infectious or non-infectious). This article
      discusses the importance, known pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical approach,
      and evidence-based therapeutic options for the management of IBS in children and 
      adolescents.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: gluten may cause depression in subjects with
      non-coeliac gluten sensitivity - an exploratory clinical study.
PG  - 1104-12
LID - 10.1111/apt.12730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported
      non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) retain gastrointestinal symptoms on a
      gluten-free diet (GFD) but continue to restrict gluten as they report 'feeling
      better'. AIM: To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those
      with NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal symptoms.
      METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (24-62 years, five male) with irritable bowel
      syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically controlled on 
      a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study. Participants randomly received 
      one of three dietary challenges for 3 days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout
      before crossing over to the next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was
      supplemented with gluten (16 g/day), whey (16 g/day) or not supplemented
      (placebo). End-points included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State 
      Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal
      symptoms. RESULTS: Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state
      depression scores compared to placebo [M = 2.03, 95% CI (0.55-3.51), P = 0.010]
      but not whey [M = 1.48, 95% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P = 0.07]. No differences were
      found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI trait measures. No difference 
      in cortisol secretion was identified between challenges. Gastrointestinal
      symptoms were induced similarly across all dietary challenges. CONCLUSIONS:
      Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of depression
      with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition. Gluten-specific
      induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not identified. Such findings might
      explain why patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity feel better on a
      gluten-free diet despite the continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by
      intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated 
      to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free
      diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains
      unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS
      have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a 
      response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been 
      postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This
      review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of
      different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper
      screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the potential role of probiotics and antimicrobials for
      management of functional bowel disorders (FBDs), with a focus on irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relevant adult data were identified 
      via PubMed, with additional references obtained by reviewing bibliographies from 
      selected articles. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment involves colonizing the
      intestines with beneficial microorganisms, whereas antimicrobial therapy involves
      modulation of the bacterial load and/or host response. A meta-analysis reported
      that all probiotic species evaluated improved flatulence compared with placebo;
      some, but not all, species improved abdominal pain and abdominal
      bloating/distension; and no species evaluated improved stool frequency or
      consistency, straining during stool evacuation, sense of incomplete evacuation,
      or fecal urgency. Two additional meta-analyses reported that probiotics
      significantly improved overall IBS symptoms. Individual studies have demonstrated
      potential benefits of probiotics for functional constipation symptoms. The
      nonsystemic antimicrobials neomycin and rifaximin have been evaluated in patients
      with IBS and other FBDs. Neomycin may improve global IBS symptoms and provide
      bowel normalization versus placebo, but the risk of ototoxicity and the
      development of clinically relevant bacterial resistance may limit its use for
      recurrent symptoms. In phase 3 randomized studies, rifaximin-treated patients
      were significantly more likely than placebo-treated patients to achieve adequate 
      relief of global IBS symptoms and abdominal bloating. Although preliminary data
      suggest that development of clinically relevant bacterial resistance is unlikely 
      with rifaximin, prospective data are needed, and a phase 3 study is ongoing.
      Limitations of evidence for probiotics include small populations analyzed and
      lack of clarity in optimal dosing regimen; antimicrobial evidence would benefit
      from better understanding of the effects of repeated treatment in patients with
      IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics and nonsystemic antibiotics have a place in IBS
      management. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal regimens and
      identify subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from these therapies.

TI  - Review article: evidence for the role of gut microbiota in irritable bowel
      syndrome and its potential influence on therapeutic targets.
PG  - 1033-42
LID - 10.1111/apt.12728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal
      disease with a substantial social and economic burden. Treatment options remain
      limited and research on the aetiology and pathophysiology of this multifactorial 
      disease is ongoing. AIM: To discuss the potential role of gut microbiota in the
      pathophysiology of IBS and to identify possible interactions with
      pathophysiologic targets in IBS. METHODS: Articles were identified via a PubMed
      database search ['irritable bowel syndrome' AND (anti-bacterial OR antibiotic OR 
      flora OR microbiota OR microflora OR probiotic)]. English-language articles were 
      screened for relevance. Full review of publications for the relevant studies was 
      conducted, including additional publications that were identified from individual
      article reference lists. RESULTS: The role of gut microbiota in IBS is supported 
      by varying lines of evidence from animal and human studies. For example,
      post-infectious IBS in humans is well documented. In addition, certain probiotics
      and nonsystemic antibiotics appear to be efficacious in the treatment of IBS.
      Mechanisms involved in improving IBS symptoms likely go beyond mere changes in
      the composition of the gut microbiota, and accumulating animal data support the
      interplay of microbiota with other IBS targets, such as the gut-brain axis,
      visceral hypersensitivity, mucosal inflammation and motility. CONCLUSION: The
      role of the gut microbiota is still being elucidated; however, it appears to be
      one of several important factors that contributes to the aetiology and
      pathophysiology of the irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Salmonella gastroenteritis during childhood is a risk factor for irritable bowel 
      syndrome in adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute infectious gastroenteritis increases the risk for
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Children are
      particularly vulnerable to gastroenteritis because of the immaturity of their
      intestinal barrier, enteric nervous system, and immune response to pathogens. We 
      investigated whether acute gastroenteritis in early life increases the risk of
      IBS and FD throughout adulthood. METHODS: In 1994, we identified and monitored a 
      single culture-proven foodborne Salmonella enteritidis outbreak that involved
      1811 patients (mostly pediatric) in Bologna, Italy. Clinical data were collected 
      and a prospective, controlled, cohort study was designed. Long-term effects were 
      assessed by mailing a questionnaire to 757 subjects 16 years after the outbreak
      (when all of the children were adults). We randomly selected a cohort of 250
      adults exposed to Salmonella as children, all 127 individuals exposed as adults, 
      and a cohort of nonexposed participants matched for number, age, sex, and area of
      residence (controls). RESULTS: Among 198 exposed participants, 64 reported FD
      (32.3%), compared with 51 of 188 controls (27.1%; P = .268). Among 204 exposed
      participants, 75 reported having IBS (36.8%) compared with 44 of 189 controls
      (23.3%; P = .004). The odds ratio for IBS among people exposed to the Salmonella 
      was 1.92 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.98). The prevalence of IBS was higher
      in individuals exposed Salmonella as children than in controls (35.3% vs 20.5%; P
      = .008), but not in individuals exposed as adults, compared with controls. After 
      multivariate logistic regression, post-infectious IBS was independently
      associated with anxiety and FD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data collected from a
      single culture-proven foodborne Salmonella enteritidis outbreak in 1994,
      Salmonella-induced gastroenteritis during childhood (but not adulthood) is a risk
      factor for IBS.

PG  - 135-54
LID - 10.1007/s10787-014-0201-4 [doi]
AB  - The microbiome located in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) comprises the
      largest community (diverse and dense) of bacteria, and in conjunction with a
      conducive internal milieu, promotes the development of regulated pro- and
      anti-inflammatory signals within the GIT that promotes immunological and
      metabolic tolerance. In addition, host-microbial interactions govern GIT
      inflammation and provide cues for upholding metabolic regulation in both the host
      and microbes. Failure to regulate inflammatory responses can increase the risk of
      developing inflammatory conditions in the GIT. Here, we review clinical studies
      regarding the efficacy of probiotics/prebiotics and the role they may have in
      restoring host metabolic homeostasis by rescuing the inflammatory response. The
      clinical studies reviewed included functional constipation, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. We have demonstrated that there was an overall reduction in risk
      when probiotics were administered over placebo in the majority of GIT
      inflammatory conditions. The effect size of a cumulative reduction in relative
      risk for the GIT conditions/diseases investigated was 0.65 (0.61-0.70) (z =
      13.3); p < 0.0001 that is an average reduction in risk of 35 % in favour of
      probiotics. We also progress a hypothesis that the GIT comprises numerous
      micro-axes (e.g. mucus secretion, Th1/Th2 balance) that are in operational
      homeostasis; hence probiotics and prebiotics may have a significant
      pharmacobiotic regulatory role in maintaining host GIT homeostasis in disease
      states partially through reactive oxygen species signalling.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the society. Among the putative
      pathogeneses, gut dysmotility results in pain and disturbed defecation. The
      latter is probably caused by the effect of abnormal gut water secretion. The
      interaction between abnormal gas accumulation, abdominal pain and bloating
      remains controversial. Visceral hypersensitivity and its modification along with 
      the central transmission are the characteristics of IBS patients. The
      identification of biologic markers based on genetic polymorphisms is
      undetermined. Imbalanced gut microbiota may alter epithelial permeability to
      activate nociceptive sensory pathways which in turn lead to IBS. Certain food
      constituents may exacerbate bowel symptoms. The impact of adult and childhood
      abuses on IBS is underestimated. Using the concept of biopsychosocial dysfunction
      can integrate multidimensional pathogeneses. Antispasmodics plus stool
      consistency modifiers to treat the major symptoms and defecation are the
      first-line drug treatment. New drugs targeting receptors governing bowel
      motility, sensation and secretion can be considered, but clinicians must be aware
      of their potential serious side effects. Psychiatric drugs and modalities may be 
      the final options for treating intractable subjects. Probiotics of multi-species 
      preparations are safe and worth to be considered for the treatment. Antibiotics
      are promising but their long-term safety and effectiveness are unknown. Diet
      therapy including exclusion of certain food constituents is an economic measure. 
      Using relatively safe complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) may be
      optional to those patients who failed classical treatment. In conclusion, IBS is 
      a heterogeneous disorder with multidimensional pathogeneses. Personalized
      medicines with multidisciplinary approaches using different classes of drugs,
      psychiatric measures, probiotics and antibiotics, dietary therapy, and finally
      CAMs, can be considered.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent
      abdominal pain or discomfort, in combination with disturbed bowel habits in the
      absence of identifiable organic cause. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine)
      is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and also large number by
      enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin plays an important part
      in gastrointestinal physiology which includes regulation of gastrointestinal
      motility, local anti-inflammatory reaction as well as moderation of visceral
      sensation. Melatonin is commonly given orally. It is categorized by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration as a dietary supplement. Melatonin treatment 
      has an extremely wide margin of safety though it may cause minor adverse effects,
      such as headache, rash and nightmares. Melatonin was touted as a potential
      effective candidate for IBS treatment. Putative role of melatonin in IBS
      treatment include analgesic effects, regulator of gastrointestinal motility and
      sensation to sleep promoter. Placebo-controlled studies in melatonin suffered
      from heterogeneity in methodology. Most studies utilized 3 mg at bedtime as the
      standard dose of trial. However, all studies had consistently showed improvement 
      in abdominal pain, some showed improvement in quality of life of IBS patients.
      Melatonin is a relatively safe drug that possesses potential in treating IBS.
      Future studies should focus on melatonin effect on gut mobility as well as its
      central nervous system effect to elucidate its role in IBS patients.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterized by abdominal
      pain or discomfort, bloating, and altered stool form and passage. Small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition in which there is
      overgrowth of bacteria in small bowel in excess of 10(5) colony forming units per
      milliliter on culture of the upper gut aspirate. Frequency of SIBO varied from
      4%-78% among patients with IBS and from 1%-40% among controls. Higher frequency
      in some studies might be due to fallacious criteria [post-lactulose
      breath-hydrogen rise 20 PPM above basal within 90 min (early-peak)]. Glucose
      hydrogen breath test (GHBT) has a low sensitivity to diagnose SIBO. Hence,
      studies based on GHBT might have under-estimated frequency of SIBO. Therefore, it
      is important to analyze these studies carefully to evaluate whether the reported 
      association between IBS and SIBO is over or under-projected. This review
      evaluates studies on association between SIBO and IBS, discordance between
      different studies, their strength and weakness including methodological issues
      and evidence on therapeutic manipulation of gut flora on symptoms of IBS.

TI  - Unraveling the ties between irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal microbiota.
PG  - 2470-81
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i10.2470 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal 
      disorder. It is a multifactorial disorder. Intestinal microbiota may cause the
      pathogenesis of IBS by contributing to abnormal gastrointestinal motility,
      low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain
      axis, and so on. Previous attempts to identify the intestinal microbiota
      composition in IBS patients have yielded inconsistent and occasionally
      contradictory results. This inconsistency may be due to the differences in the
      molecular techniques employed, the sample collection and handling methods, use of
      single samples that are not linked to fluctuating symptoms, or other factors such
      as patients' diets and phenotypic characterizations. Despite these difficulties, 
      previous studies found that the intestinal microbiota in some IBS patients was
      completely different from that in healthy controls, and there does appear to be a
      consistent theme of Firmicutes enrichment and reduced abundance of Bacteroides.
      Based on the differences in intestinal microbiota composition, many studies have 
      addressed the roles of microbiota-targeted treatments, such as antibiotics and
      probiotics, in alleviating certain symptoms of IBS. This review summarizes the
      current knowledge of the associations between intestinal microbiota and IBS as
      well as the possible modes of action of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis
      of IBS. Improving the current level of understanding of host-microbiota
      interactions in IBS is important not only for determining the role of intestinal 
      microbiota in IBS pathogenesis but also for therapeutic modulation of the
      microbiota.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial on the effect of a multispecies probiotic on
      visceroperception in hypersensitive IBS patients.
PG  - 705-14
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by heterogeneous
      pathophysiology and low response to treatment. Up to 60% of IBS patients suffers 
      from visceral hypersensitivity, which is associated with symptom severity and
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Recently, positive effects of
      probiotics in IBS have been reported, but overall the response was modest. We
      performed a study in IBS patients, characterized by visceral hypersensitivity
      measured with the rectal barostat, aiming to assess the effect of 6 weeks of
      multispecies probiotic mix on visceral pain perception. METHODS: We conducted a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in forty Rome III IBS patients
      with visceral hypersensitivity. Prior to intake, patients kept a 2-week symptom
      diary and underwent a rectal barostat measurement. When hypersensitivity was
      confirmed, participation was allowed and patients received a multispecies
      probiotic with in vitro proven potential beneficial effects on mechanisms
      contributing to visceral hypersensitivity (six different probiotic strains; 10(9)
      cfu/g), or a placebo product of one sachet (5 g) per day for 6 weeks. At the end 
      of the intervention period, visceroperception and symptoms were reassessed. KEY
      RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the trial. The percentage of patients
      with visceral hypersensitivity decreased significantly in the probiotic and
      placebo group (76.5% and 71.4%, respectively; N.S. between groups). Improvement
      in pain scores and mean symptom score did not differ between the probiotic and
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In this placebo-controlled trial in IBS 
      patients with visceral hypersensitivity, no significant effect of a multispecies 
      probiotic on viscerperception was observed. The study has been registered in the 
      US National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00702026).

LID - 10.3920/BM2013.0033 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal microbiota forms a complex ecosystem that is in close contact with
      its host and has an important impact on health. An increasing number of disorders
      are associated with disturbances in this ecosystem. Also patients suffering from 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) show an altered composition of their gut
      microbiota. IBS is a multifactorial chronic disorder characterised by various
      abdominal complaints and a worldwide prevalence of 10-20%. Even though its
      aetiology and pathophysiology are complex and not well understood, it is widely
      accepted that aberrations along the microbe-gut-brain axis are involved. In this 
      review, it will be discussed how exogenous factors, e.g. antibiotics, can cause
      disbalance in the intestinal microbiota and thereby contribute to the development
      of IBS. In addition, several new IBS treatment options that aim at
      re-establishing a healthy, beneficial ecosystem will be described. These include 
      antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and faecal transplantation.

AB  - Alterations in the bidirectional interactions between the intestine and the
      nervous system have important roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). A body of largely preclinical evidence suggests that the gut
      microbiota can modulate these interactions. A small and poorly defined role for
      dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through
      characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported
      improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics,
      probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are 
      caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or 
      primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered
      interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the
      potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of
      patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal
      microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate
      intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.

AB  - About two-thirds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients associate their
      symptoms with certain foods. We reviewed food-related factors putatively
      associated with manifestations of IBS. Soluble fiber may improve constipation but
      frequently increases bloating and abdominal pain. Carbohydrate malabsorption
      seems to be more frequent in IBS. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet significantly reduces IBS
      symptoms and has been suggested as a therapeutic option. Serological screening
      for celiac disease should be done in patients without constipation. Moreover,
      non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity, defined as gluten intolerance once celiac 
      disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out, should be considered in these
      patients. There is no specific diet for IBS patients but small and frequent
      meals, avoiding greasy foods, dairy products, many carbohydrates, caffeine and
      alcohol, is recommended.

TI  - Effect of Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum wheat on irritable bowel syndrome: a
      double-blinded randomised dietary intervention trial.
PG  - 1992-9
LID - 10.1017/S000711451400018X [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a replacement diet with
      organic, semi-whole-grain products derived from Triticum turgidum subsp.
      turanicum (ancient) wheat on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and
      inflammatory/biochemical parameters. A double-blinded randomised cross-over trial
      was performed using twenty participants (thirteen females and seven males, aged
      18-59 years) classified as having moderate IBS. Participants received products
      (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from ancient or modern wheat
      for 6 weeks in a random order. Symptoms due to IBS were evaluated using two
      questionnaires, which were compiled both at baseline and on a weekly basis during
      the intervention period. Blood analyses were carried out at the beginning and end
      of each respective intervention period. During the intervention period with
      ancient wheat products, patients experienced a significant decrease in the
      severity of IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P=
      0.004), satisfaction with stool consistency (P< 0.001) and tiredness (P< 0.0001).
      No significant difference was observed after the intervention period with modern 
      wheat products. Similarly, patients reported significant amelioration in the
      severity of gastrointestinal symptoms only after the ancient wheat intervention
      period, as measured by the intensity of pain (P= 0.001), the frequency of pain
      (P< 0.0001), bloating (P< 0.0001), abdominal distension (P< 0.001) and the
      quality of life (P< 0.0001). Interestingly, the inflammatory profile showed a
      significant reduction in the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
      including IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and
      vascular endothelial growth factor after the intervention period with ancient
      wheat products, but not after the control period. In conclusion, significant
      improvements in both IBS symptoms and the inflammatory profile were reported
      after the ingestion of ancient wheat products.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: a functional disorder?].
PG  - 321-34
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a highly prevalent condition responsible for almost
      one third of visits to the gastroenterologist and huge expenses for diagnosis,
      treatment and loss of working days. A unique pathophysiologic mechanism has not
      been elucidated yet and several possibilities have been proposed such as
      senso-perception and motor disturbances, the effect of stress and anxiety,
      serotonin receptor failures, activation of abnormal brain areas and pain
      modulation differences, among others. The absence of a biological marker has led 
      the investigators to consider this syndrome as an exclusion diagnostic condition,
      once the organic diseases have been discarded The changes in gut microbiota have 
      recently raised great interest among gastroenterologists. The study of the small 
      intestinal bowel overgrowth syndrome, the effect of antibiotics upon the flora,
      the recognition of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and the action of
      probiotics, together with the effect of malabsortion of diet carbohydrates have
      brought some new light in our knowledge. The present update will focus on the
      published evidence about the subject, bearing in mind that the mechanisms
      elicited here are only suitable for a subgroup of patients.

AB  - There is compelling rationale for manipulating the microbiota to treat
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Although studies of animal models of
      intestinal inflammation produced promising results, trials in humans have been
      disappointing. In contrast to IBD, the role of the microbiota in the development 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only recently has been considered, but early
      stage results have been encouraging. As pharmaceutical companies develop fewer
      truly novel agents for treatment of these disorders, consumers seek safer,
      long-term strategies to deal with chronic symptoms. We assess the rationale for
      modulating the microbiota for treatment of IBD and IBS, and discuss whether
      current concepts are simplistic and overstated or simply under-researched. Are
      claims exaggerated and expectations unrealistic? Difficulties with microbiota
      terminology and technologies, as well as differences among patients and the
      heterogeneity of these diseases, pose additional challenges in developing
      microbiota-based therapies for IBD and IBS.

AB  - CONTEXT: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease
      characterized by abdominal pain and altered intestinal habits. The
      pathophysiology of IBS remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that
      some IBS patients, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), display
      persistent signs of minor mucosal inflammation and a modified intestinal
      microflora. The mesalazine has known intestinal anti-inflammatory properties.
      Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic used for a long time in treatment of
      diarrhea, including infectious diarrhea. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of
      mesalazine alone, combined therapy of mesalazine with liophylised Saccharomyces
      boulardii or alone on symptoms of IBS-D patients. METHODS: Based on Rome III
      criteria, 53 IBS-D patients (18 year or more) were included. To exclude organic
      diseases all patients underwent colonoscopy, stool culture, serum anti-endomisium
      antibody, lactose tolerance test and ova and parasite exam. Patients were divided
      in three groups: mesalazine group (MG) - 20 patients received mesalazine 800 mg
      t.i.d. for 30 days; mesalazine and Saccharomyces boulardii group (MSbG) - 21
      patients received mesalazine 800 mg t.i.d. and Saccharomyces boulardii 200 mg
      t.i.d. for 30 days and; Saccharomyces boulardii group (SbG) - 12 patients
      received Sb 200 mg t.i.d. for 30 days. Drugs that might have any effect on
      intestinal motility or secretion were not allowed. Symptom evaluations at
      baseline and after treatment were performed by means of a 4-point likert scale
      including: stool frequency, stool form and consistency (Bristol scale), abdominal
      pain and distension. Paired t test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there were statistically
      significant reduction of symptom score after 30 th day therapy in all three
      groups: MG (P<0.0001); MSbG (P<0.0001) and in SbG (P = 0.003). There were
      statistically significant differences in the symptom score at 30 th day therapy
      of the MG, MSbG and SbG groups (P = 0.03). There were no statistical differences 
      between MSbG and MG symptom score at 30th day therapy (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The
      use of mesalazine alone, Saccharomyces boulardii alone or combined treatment with
      mesalasine and Saccaromyces boulardii improved IBS-D symptoms. The improvement of
      the symptom score was greater with mesalazine alone or combined with Sb as
      compared with Sb treatment alone. These preliminary results suggest that
      mezalazine may be useful in treatment of IBS-d patients, and warrant further
      larger studies.

TI  - Review article: Linaclotide for the management of irritable bowel syndrome with
      constipation.
PG  - 371-84
LID - 10.1111/apt.12604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) represents a
      significant burden to patients and healthcare systems due to its prevalence and
      lack of successful symptomatic resolution with established treatment options.
      Linaclotide 290 mug has recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency
      (EMA) for moderate-to-severe IBS-C and by the US Food and Drug Administration for
      IBS-C (290 mug dose) and for chronic constipation (145 mug dose). AIM: To
      summarise data leading to the approval of linaclotide for IBS-C, with focus on
      EMA-pre-specified outcome measures. METHODS: Literature search of a peer-review
      database (PubMed) and review of congress abstracts on linaclotide preclinical and
      clinical trial data in IBS-C. RESULTS: Preclinical studies suggest that the
      guanylate cyclase C agonist (GCCA) linaclotide acts through elevation of cyclic
      guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, leading to accelerated gastrointestinal
      (GI) transit through increased fluid secretion and reduced visceral
      hypersensitivity. Clinical trial data demonstrate that linaclotide improves
      abdominal symptoms (pain, bloating) and bowel symptoms (constipation) compared
      with placebo in patients with IBS-C. The most frequent side effect, diarrhoea,
      results from the therapeutic action of linaclotide. Linaclotide acts locally in
      the GI tract with minimal systemic exposure, resulting in low oral
      bioavailability and thus a low risk of relevant systemic adverse effects.
      CONCLUSION: Linaclotide, a first-in-class GCCA, is a promising new drug with a
      novel, dual mechanism of action that, unlike more well-established agents, can
      relieve the abdominal pain, bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C and
      has a low propensity for systemic side effects.

TI  - Sigmoid diverticulitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 287-97
LID - 10.1001/jama.2013.282025 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Diverticulitis is a common disease. Recent changes in understanding
      its natural history have substantially modified treatment paradigms. OBJECTIVE:
      To review the etiology and natural history of diverticulitis and recent changes
      in treatment guidelines. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane
      databases for English-language articles pertaining to diagnosis and management of
      diverticulitis published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013. Search
      terms applied to 4 thematic topics: pathophysiology, natural history, medical
      management, and indications for surgery. We excluded small case series and
      articles based on data accrued prior to 2000. We hand searched the bibliographies
      of included studies, yielding a total of 186 articles for full review. We graded 
      the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect,
      according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on
      Practice Guidelines. FINDINGS: Eighty articles met criteria for analysis. The
      pathophysiology of diverticulitis is associated with altered gut motility,
      increased luminal pressure, and a disordered colonic microenvironment. Several
      studies examined histologic commonalities with inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome but were focused on associative rather than causal
      pathways. The natural history of uncomplicated diverticulitis is often benign.
      For example, in a cohort study of 2366 of 3165 patients hospitalized for acute
      diverticulitis and followed up for 8.9 years, only 13.3% of patients had a
      recurrence and 3.9%, a second recurrence. In contrast to what was previously
      thought, the risk of septic peritonitis is reduced and not increased with each
      recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes studies show 20% to 35% of patients managed
      nonoperatively progress to chronic abdominal pain compared with 5% to 25% of
      patients treated operatively. Randomized trials and cohort studies have shown
      that antibiotics and fiber were not as beneficial as previously thought and that 
      mesalamine might be useful. Surgical therapy for chronic disease is not always
      warranted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recent studies demonstrate a lesser role
      for aggressive antibiotic or surgical intervention for chronic or recurrent
      diverticulitis than was previously thought necessary.

      proportion of E. coli O157 cases that develop chronic sequelae.
PG  - 79-95
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2013.1572 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the
      proportion of Escherichia coli O157 cases that develop chronic sequelae. DATA
      SOURCES: We conducted a systematic review of articles published prior to July
      2011 in Pubmed, Agricola, CabDirect, or Food Safety and Technology Abstracts.
      STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected that reported the number of E. coli O157
      cases that developed reactive arthritis (ReA), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or Guillain Barre syndrome.
      METHODS: Three levels of screening and data extraction of articles were conducted
      using predefined data fields. Meta-analysis was performed on unique outcome
      measures using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed using the
      I(2) value. Meta-regression was used to explore the influence of nine study-level
      variables on heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 82 studies were identified
      reporting 141 different outcome measures; 81 reported on HUS and one reported on 
      ReA. Depending on the number of cases of E. coli O157, the estimate for the
      proportion of E. coli O157 cases that develop HUS ranged from 17.2% in
      extra-small studies (<50 cases) to 4.2% in extra-large studies (>1000 cases).
      Heterogeneity was significantly associated with group size (p<0.0001); however,
      the majority of the heterogeneity was unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: High unexplained 
      heterogeneity indicated that the study-level factors examined had a minimal
      influence on the variation of estimates reported.

LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1361825 [doi]
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract inhabits a complex microbial ecosystem that
      plays a vital role in host health through its contributions to nutrient synthesis
      and digestion, protection from pathogens, and promoting maturation of host innate
      and adapt immune systems. The development of gut microbiota primarily occurs
      during infancy and is influenced by multiple factors, including prenatal
      exposure; gestational age; mode of delivery; feeding type; pre-, pro-, and
      antibiotic use; and host genetics. In genetically susceptible individuals,
      changes in the gut microbiota induced by environmental factors may contribute to 
      the development of immune-related disorders in childhood, including atopic
      diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Pre- and probiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment 
      of some immune-related diseases by modulating gut microbiota and regulating host 
      mucosal immune function. The review will discuss recent findings on the
      environmental factors that influence development of gut microbiota during infancy
      and its potential impact on some immune-related diseases in childhood. The use of
      pre- and probiotics for prevention and intervention of several important diseases
      in early life will also be reviewed.

TI  - Responders vs clinical response: a critical analysis of data from linaclotide
      phase 3 clinical trials in IBS-C.
PG  - 326-33
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a rigorous standard for
      defining patient responders in irritable bowel syndrome-C (IBS-C; i.e., FDA's
      Responder Endpoint) for regulatory approval. However, this endpoint's utility for
      health-care practitioners to assess clinical response has not been determined. We
      analyzed pooled IBS-C linaclotide trial data to evaluate clinically significant
      responses in linaclotide-treated patients who did not meet the FDA responder
      definition. METHODS: Percentages of FDA non-responders reporting improvement in
      abdominal pain, bowel function and/or global relief measures were determined
      using pooled data from two linaclotide Phase 3 IBS-C trials. KEY RESULTS: 1602
      IBS-C patients enrolled; 34% of linaclotide-treated and 17% of placebo-treated
      patients met the FDA Responder Endpoint (p < 0.0001). Among FDA non-responders at
      week 12, 63% of linaclotide-treated patients reported their abdominal pain was at
      least somewhat relieved, compared with 48% of placebo-treated patients. For stool
      frequency, 62% of linaclotide-treated patients reported that they were at least
      somewhat improved at week 12, compared with 46% of placebo-treated patients. For 
      global IBS symptoms, 65% of linaclotide-treated patients reported at least some
      IBS-symptom relief, 43% reported adequate relief of IBS symptoms, and 57%
      reported being satisfied with linaclotide treatment, vs placebo rates of 48%,
      34%, and 41% respectively. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Most linaclotide-treated
      IBS-C patients who were FDA non-responders reported some improvement in abdominal
      pain and stool frequency, and global relief/satisfaction. In addition to the FDA 
      Responder Endpoint, differing response thresholds and symptom-specific change
      from baseline should be considered by clinicians for a complete understanding of 
      clinical response to linaclotide and other IBS-C therapies.

TI  - [Characteristics of the gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity in patients with 
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease associated with metabolic syndrome].
PG  - 46-53
AB  - PURPOSE: Electrogastroenterography (EGEG) is a method of measuring action
      potentials of the digestive tract. The aim of the study was to evaluate the main 
      features of the gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity (GI MEA) in patients with
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with metabolic syndrome (MS).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: GI motility function in fasting and postprandial periods
      by the peripheral EGEG (EGEG system "Gastroenterological GEM-01") were recorded
      in 33 patients with NAFLD associated with MS, 26 patients with mixed type of
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and 10 healthy volunteers aged from 18 to 70
      years. RESULTS: Total fasting GI MEA data of patients with NAFLD associated with 
      MS (Me = 40,99 MB) dominated over the same in patients with IBS (Me = 23.84 mV)
      and healthy volunteers (Me = 11.26 mV), the differences between EGEG parameters
      was not significant but critical (H = 5.997, p = 0.050). This trend was observed 
      in postprandial period (H = 0.891, p = 0.640). In postprandial period total GI
      MEA in patients with NAFLD associated with MS was increased in 36.4% patients
      (95% CI: 24.7-56.3%) only while in IBS patients and healthy volunteers total GI
      MEA tract were increased in 76.9% patients (95% CI: 58.0-89.0%) and in 90.0% (95%
      CI: 59.6-98.2%) correspondently (chi2 = 14.12, p = 0.001). Postprandial ratio
      (PPR) (ratio between total GI MEA in postprandial and fasting periods) of GI MEA 
      were less than 1.0 in patients with NAFLD associated with MS (Me = 0.65) and less
      then PPRs in patients with IBS and healthy volunteers (H = 10.378, p = 0.006).
      PPR in patients with IBS was less then this ratio in healthy volunteers (Me =
      1.48 vs Me = 1.66) CONCLUSION: The increased total GI MEA is observed in patients
      with NAFLD associated with MS. Patients with NAFLD associated with MS have
      abnormal GI MEA in response on food stimulation. This fact may be important in
      the development of NAFLD and MS.

PG  - 13-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an algorithm for evaluation of the immune status in IBS
      patients with food intolerance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 42 patients with IBS were 
      observed. The diagnosis is based Rome III criteria. Determination of the
      concentration of serum allergen-IgG-antibodies to food allergens, IgG, IgA, IgM, 
      IgE and immunoregulatory substances IL-5, TGF beta1, IL-10, IL-4 IL-2, IL-13 were
      determined by enzyme immunoassay. All the patients received rotational diet
      therapy based on immunoassay data in addition to medical treatment of the basis
      disease. The control group comprised 15 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Food
      intolerances basically to foods proteinaceous was diagnosed in 25 patients with
      IBS (59.5% of cases). The effectiveness of diet therapy was 68% (17 patients).
      Analysis of clinical and laboratory data revealed that the implementation of food
      intolerance in patients with IBS reducing the levels of IL-10 and TGFbeta1. An
      effective rotational diet of food intolerance in IBS patients had significantly
      (p < 0.05) increase IgA levels. CONCLUSION: Food intolerance in IBS patients
      characterized an increased synthesis of allergen-specific IgG antibodies,
      insufficient production of anti-inflammatory immunoregulatory substances IL-10
      and TGFbeta1, and intact cytokines IL-2, - 4, - 5, - 13, IgG and IgM in serum.
      Efficiency rotary diet in patients with IBS is accompanied by positive clinical
      dynamics, increase levels of anti-inflammatory substances and serum IgA.

TI  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Is it in the gluten or the grain?
PG  - 435-40
AB  - Celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the small intestine
      caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins in genetically
      predisposed individuals. Over the past several years, the concept of non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained significant interest from the scientific
      community and mass media and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free
      diet is rapidly growing. This condition is characterized by gastrointestinal or
      extraintestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence for
      underlying celiac disease or wheat allergy. Symptoms display significant overlap 
      with the irritable bowel syndrome. Many important factors regarding this
      relatively novel condition remain to be elucidated; no discriminative markers to 
      support a diagnosis of gluten sensitivity have been identified yet and its
      pathogenesis remains obscure. Here we review the current knowledge on NCGS, and
      outline potential pathogenic pathways of different gluten related disorders in
      order to gain clues about the pathophysiology of this novel condition.

TI  - Medically unexplained conditions considered by patients in general practice.
PG  - 156-63
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmt081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients frequently present with multiple and 'unexplained' symptoms,
      often resulting in complex consultations. To better understand these patients is 
      a challenge to health care professionals, in general, and GPs, in particular.
      OBJECTIVES: In our research on symptom reporting, we wanted to explore whether
      patients consider that they may suffer from conditions commonly regarded as
      unexplained, and we explored associations between these concerns and symptom
      load, life stressors and socio-demographic factors. METHODS: Consecutive,
      unselected patients in general practice completed questionnaires addressing eight
      conditions commonly regarded as unexplained (amalgam poisoning, Candida syndrome,
      fibromyalgia, food intolerance, electromagnetic hypersensitivity, burnout
      syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome). With logistic
      regression, we analysed associations with symptom load, burden of life stressors 
      with negative impact on present health and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: 
      Out of the 909 respondents (response rate = 88.8%), 863 had complete data. In
      total, 39.6% of patients had considered that they may suffer from one or more
      unexplained conditions (UCs). These concerns were strongly and positively
      associated with recent symptom load and number of life stressors. If we excluded 
      burnout and food intolerance, corresponding associations were found. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients frequently considered that they may suffer from UCs. The likelihood of
      such concerns strongly increased with an increasing symptom load and with the
      number of life stressors with negative impact on present health. Hence, the
      number of symptoms may be a strong indicator of whether patients consider their
      symptoms part of such often controversial multisymptom conditions.

AB  - It is unknown whether children with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      identify specific foods that exacerbate their GI symptoms. The objectives of this
      study were to determine the perceived role of food on GI symptoms and to
      determine the impact of food-induced symptoms on quality of life (QOL) in
      children with functional GI disorders. Between August and November 2010, 25
      children ages 11 to 17 years old with functional GI disorders and a parent
      completed a food symptom association questionnaire and validated questionnaires
      assessing FGID symptoms and QOL. In addition, children completed a 24-hour food
      recall, participated in focus groups to identify problematic foods and any coping
      strategies, and discussed how their QOL was affected. Statistical analyses were
      conducted using chi2, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank, and
      Spearman's rho. Children identified a median of 11 (range=2 to 25) foods as
      exacerbating a GI symptom, with the most commonly identified foods being spicy
      foods, cow's milk, and pizza. Several coping strategies were identified,
      including consuming smaller portions, modifying foods, and avoiding a median of 8
      (range=1 to 20) foods. Children reported that food-induced symptoms interfered
      with school performance, sports, and social activities. Although the parent's
      assessment of their child's QOL negatively correlated with the number of
      perceived symptom-inducing foods in their child, this relationship was not found 
      in the children. Findings suggest that specific foods are perceived to exacerbate
      GI symptoms in children with functional GI disorders. In addition, despite use of
      several coping strategies, food-induced symptoms can adversely impact children's 
      QOL in several important areas.

AB  - Dietary intolerances to fructose, fructans and FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) are common, yet
      poorly recognized and managed. Over the last decade, they have come to the
      forefront because of new knowledge on the mechanisms and treatment of these
      conditions. Patients with these problems often present with unexplained bloating,
      belching, distension, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Here, we have examined
      the most up-to-date research on these food-related intolerances, discussed
      controversies, and have provided some guidelines for the dietary management of
      these conditions. Breath testing for carbohydrate intolerance appears to be
      standardized and essential for the diagnosis and management of these conditions, 
      especially in the Western population. While current research shows that the
      FODMAP diet may be effective in treating some patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome, additional research is needed to identify more foods items that are
      high in FODMAPs, and to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dietary
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an inflammatory disease of, the small intestine
      with a prevalence of roughly 0.5%-1%. Its symptoms arise in response to gluten
      consumption by genetically predisposed persons (HLA-DQ2/8). The autoantigen
      tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
      celiac disease. METHOD: Selective review of pertinent literature, including
      guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Celiac disease can present at any
      age with gastrointestinal or extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., malabsorption 
      or Duhring's dermatitis herpetiformis); it can also be found in association with 
      other (auto-)immune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Most cases are
      oligosymptomatic. The wide differential diagnosis includes food intolerances,
      intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other conditions. The 
      definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of celiac disease-specific
      autoantibody to TG2 (endomysium), which is over 90% sensitive and far over 90%
      specific, and the characteristic histologic lesions of the small-bowel mucosa and
      remission on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: An understanding of celiac disease
      ought to inform everyday clinical practice in all medical disciplines, because
      this is a common condition with diverse manifestations that can be effectively
      diagnosed and easily treated for the prevention of both acute and long-term
      complications. Patients should follow a strictly gluten-free diet for life.

AB  - CONTEXT: Fructose is a monosaccharide frequently present in natural and
      artificial juice fruits. When the concentration of fructose in certain food is
      present in excess of glucose concentration some individuals may develop fructose 
      malabsorption. OBJECTIVES: To report the frequency of fructose malabsorption
      utilizing the hydrogen breath test in children with gastrointestinal and/or
      nutritional disorders. METHODS: Between July 2011 and July 2012, 43 patients with
      gastrointestinal and/or nutritional disorders, from both sexes, were
      consecutively studied, utilizing the hydrogen breath test with loads of the
      following carbohydrates: lactose, glucose, fructose and lactulose. Fructose was
      offered in a 10% aqueous solution in the dose of 1 g/kg body weight. Samples were
      collected fasting and at every 15 minutes after the intake of the aqueous
      solution for a 2 hour period. Malabsorption was considered when there was an
      increase of >20 ppm of hydrogen over the fasting level, and intolerance was
      diagnosed if gastrointestinal symptoms would appear. RESULTS: The age of the
      patients varied from 3 months to 16 years, 24 were boys. The following diagnosis 
      were established: irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea in 16, functional
      abdominal pain in 8, short stature in 10, lactose intolerance in 3, celiac
      disease in 1, food allergy in 1 and giardiasis in 1 patient. Fructose
      malabsorption was characterized in 13 (30.2%) patients, and intolerance in 1
      (2.3%) patient. The most frequent fructose malabsorption was characterized in 7
      (16.3%) patients with irritable bowel syndrome and in 4 (9.3%) patients with
      functional abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      and functional abdominal pain were the main cause of fructose malabsorption.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse food reactions (AFR) have has recently attracted increased
      attention from the media and are now more commonly reported by patients. Its
      classification, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment are complex and present a
      considerable challenge in clinical practice. Non-immune-mediated types of food
      intolerance have a cumulative prevalence of 30% to 40%, while true
      (immune-mediated) food allergies affect only 2% to 5% of the German population.
      METHOD: We selectively searched the literature for pertinent publications on
      carbohydrate malabsorption, with special attention to published guidelines and
      position papers. RESULTS: Carbohydrate intolerance can be the result of a rare,
      systemic metabolic defect (e.g., fructose intolerance, with a prevalence of 1 in 
      25,000 persons) or of gastrointestinal carbohydrate malabsorption. The
      malabsorption of simple carbohydrates is the most common type of
      non-immune-mediated food intolerance, affecting 20% to 30% of the European
      population. This condition is caused either by deficient digestion of lactose or 
      by malabsorption of fructose and/or sorbitol. Half of all cases of
      gastrointestinal carbohydrate intolerance have nonspecific manifestations, with a
      differential diagnosis including irritable bowel syndrome, intolerance reactions,
      chronic infections, bacterial overgrowth, drug side effects, and other diseases. 
      The diagnostic evaluation includes a nutritional history, an H2 breath test,
      ultrasonography, endoscopy, and stool culture. CONCLUSION: The goals of treatment
      for carbohydrate malabsorption are to eliminate the intake of the responsible
      carbohydrate substance or reduce it to a tolerable amount and to assure the
      physiological nutritional composition of the patient's diet. In parallel with
      these goals, the patient should receive extensive information about the
      condition, and any underlying disease should be adequately treated.

LID - 10.1097/MED.0000000000000032 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to update the reader on current developments
      in our understanding of how the gut microbiota impact on inflammatory bowel
      disease and the irritable bowel syndrome. It will also consider current efforts
      to modulate the microbiota for therapeutic effect. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene
      polymorphisms associated with inflammatory bowel disease increasingly suggest
      that interaction with the microbiota drives pathogenesis. This may be through
      modulation of the immune response, mucosal permeability or the products of
      microbial metabolism. Similar findings in irritable bowel syndrome have
      reinforced the role of gut-specific factors in this 'functional' disorder.
      Metagenomic analysis has identified alterations in pathways and interactions with
      the ecosystem of the microbiome that may not be recognized by taxonomic
      description alone, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism. Treatments targeted
      at the microbial stimulus with antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics have all
      progressed in the past year. Studies on the long-term effects of treatment on the
      microbiome suggest that dietary intervention may be needed for prolonged
      efficacy. SUMMARY: The microbiome represents 'the other genome', and to
      appreciate its role in health and disease will be as challenging as with our own 
      genome. Intestinal diseases occur at the front line of our interaction with the
      microbiome and their future treatment will be shaped as we unravel our
      relationship with it.

AB  - The human gut is a huge complex ecosystem where microbiota, nutrients, and host
      cells interact extensively, a process crucial for the gut homeostasis and host
      development with a real partnership. The various bacterial communities that make 
      up the gut microbiota have many functions including metabolic, barrier effect,
      and trophic functions. Hence, any dysbiosis could have negative consequences in
      terms of health and many diseases have been associated to impairment of the gut
      microbiota. These close relationships between gut microbiota, health, and
      disease, have led to great interest in using probiotics (i.e. live
      micro-organisms), or prebiotics (i.e. non-digestible substrates) to positively
      modulate the gut microbiota to prevent or treat some diseases. This review
      focuses on probiotics, their mechanisms of action, safety, and major health
      benefits. Health benefits remain to be proven in some indications, and further
      studies on the best strain(s), dose, and algorithm of administration to be used
      are needed. Nevertheless, probiotic administration seems to have a great
      potential in terms of health that justifies more research.

TI  - Histamine and gut mucosal immune regulation.
PG  - 273-81
LID - 10.1111/all.12330 [doi]
AB  - Histamine is a biogenic amine with extensive effects on many cell types, mediated
      by the activation of its four receptors (H1R-H4R). Distinct effects are dependent
      on receptor subtypes and their differential expression. Within the
      gastrointestinal tract, histamine is present at relatively high concentrations,
      particularly during inflammatory responses. In this review, we discuss the
      immunoregulatory influence of histamine on a number of gastrointestinal
      disorders, including food allergy, scombroid food poisoning, histamine
      intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is
      clear that the effects of histamine on mucosal immune homeostasis are dependent
      on expression and activity of the four currently known histamine receptors;
      however, the relative protective or pathogenic effects of histamine on
      inflammatory processes within the gut are still poorly defined and require
      further investigation.

TI  - The therapeutic effect of probiotic bacteria on gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 759-66
AB  - The cause of many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome,
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease: inflammatory and necrotizing enterocolitis or
      diarrhea: infectious, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea caused by antibiotic
      treatment is an imbalance of intestinal microflora. Probiotics are live
      microorganisms, which administered in sufficient quantities, have beneficial
      health effects. The phenomenon of eating probiotic products started 100 years
      ago, when the first reports showed beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria on
      human health. Since then, probiotic preparations have become an essential element
      in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Currently, probiotics are of
      the utmost importance in supporting the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases
      and autoimmune disorders. Probiotic microorganisms are primarily lactic
      acid-producing bacteria of the general Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium. Many
      studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of probiotics, particularly in the 
      treatment of acute diarrhea. This applies in particular to diarrhea of viral
      etiology, especially in infants and young children.

TI  - Role of FODMAP content in enteral nutrition-associated diarrhea.
PG  - 25-8
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12272 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea are common complications of enteral 
      nutrition (EN); however, the cause is unclear. Mode of EN delivery that alters
      digestion and possibly absorption is suggested to contribute to the high
      incidence of diarrhea; however, enteral formula is frequently blamed. Most
      research has focused on fiber-supplemented EN, with a meta-analysis showing that 
      fiber reduces the incidence of diarrhea in non-intensive care unit studies. Other
      hypotheses include formula osmolality and FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) content. FODMAPs are poorly absorbed
      short-chain carbohydrates that exert an osmotic effect. Dietary FODMAPs have been
      shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, in those with
      irritable bowel syndrome and, given a high-enough dose, will induce a laxative
      effect in most people. As FODMAPs are commonly added to enteral formula and EN is
      frequently used as the main source of nutrition, it is reasonable to hypothesize 
      that EN provides more FODMAPs than usual dietary intake and increases risk for
      developing diarrhea. This hypothesis was assessed through a retrospective study
      showing that the standard-use enteral formula Isosource 1.5 had a protective
      effect of developing diarrhea. The only characteristic unique to Isosource 1.5
      was the lower FODMAP content as determined through methodologies previously
      validated for food analysis. Methodologies for application to enteral formulas
      are currently undergoing formal validation. Once confirmed for application in
      enteral formula, future directions include FODMAP analysis of specific
      ingredients to increase understanding of potential problems associated with
      enteral formula and a randomized, controlled trial investigating the role of
      formula FODMAP content.

TI  - Faecal incontinence in rural and regional northern Queensland community-dwelling 
      adults.
PG  - 2563
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of liquid
      or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been reported in 8% of
      the South Australian and 11% of the urban New South Wales community-dwelling
      populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005 reported faecal incontinence in
      more than 20% of colorectal and urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville
      Hospital (a referral centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted
      concern regarding the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North 
      and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities. METHODS: The sample size
      was based on the New South Wales postal surveys (11% prevalence). Higher rates
      were expected in North/Far North Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at
      12.1% (confidence interval +/- 2%, ie the true level to be between 10.1% and
      14.1%). The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland)
      and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the present
      study was compiled using a systematic randomised process selecting two private
      names from each column on each page of the Cairns and Townsville White Pages(R)
      (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226 remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural,
      320 remote). The questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk
      factors, bowel habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. 
      Faecal incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool in
      the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or contaminated
      food. To improve the response rate a participation incentive of a chance to win a
      $250 voucher or one of ten $50 vouchers was offered in the initial mail-out. The 
      initial survey was mailed out in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out
      to non-responders in September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly
      selected non-responders were telephoned in February 2008. RESULTS: A total of
      1523 responses provided a 48.1% response rate. Faecal incontinence prevalence was
      12.7% (174/1366) with no gender or locality differences. Prevalence increased
      significantly with age in men (p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents
      with faecal incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this
      reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical conditions
      including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, injury
      to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease, neurological disease and
      psychiatric problems (all, p< 0.05). Stool-related accidental bowel leakage
      including faecal incontinence (defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was
      18.2%. An additional 3% were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of
      mucus, bothersome or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2%
      reported incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9% could not always
      differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2% reported neither concerns 
      with nor accidental bowel leakage. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of
      untreated faecal incontinence in North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand
      for treatment will increase because of the ageing population and the expectations
      of younger, more assertive cohorts.

      the quantity and quality of the current evidence regarding the effect of
      different probiotic strains in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGID) in children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are more
      effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related
      FGID, especially with respect to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. To date,
      however, probiotics have not proved effective for children with functional
      constipation.

AB  - This study was aimed at combining the highest degradation of gluten during wheat 
      flour fermentation with good structural and sensory features of the related
      bread. As estimated by R5-ELISA, the degree of degradation of immune reactive
      gluten was ca. 28%. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and RP-FPLC analyses showed
      marked variations of the protein fractions compared to the untreated flour. The
      comparison was also extended to in vitro effect of the peptic/tryptic-digests
      towards K562 and T84 cells. The flour with the intermediate content of gluten
      (ICG) was used for bread making, and compared to whole gluten (WG) bread. The
      chemical, structural and sensory features of the ICG bread approached those of
      the bread made with WG flour. The protein digestibility of the ICG bread was
      higher than that from WG flour. Also the nutritional quality, as estimated by
      different indexes, was the highest for ICG bread.

TI  - The human microbiome and probiotics: implications for pediatrics.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1159/000354899 [doi]
AB  - Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human
      microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely
      contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial
      microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important
      considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future.
      Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing
      rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of
      the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear
      capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics
      may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome
      function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human
      health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the
      context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states
      include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis,
      acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it
      is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the 
      impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced
      understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate
      selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.

LID - 10.1159/000354902 [doi]
AB  - Various disease states are associated with an imbalance of protective and
      pathogenic bacteria in the gut, termed dysbiosis. Current evidence reveals that
      dietary factors affect the microbial ecosystem in the gut. Changes to community
      structure of the intestinal microbiota are not without consequence considering
      the wide effects that the microbes have on both local and systemic immunity. The 
      goal of this review is to give insight into the importance of gut microbiota in
      disease development and the possible therapeutic interventions in clinical
      settings. We introduce the complex tripartite relationship between diet, microbes
      and the gut epithelium. This is followed by a summary of clinical evidence of
      diet-induced dysbiosis as a contributing factor in the development of
      gastrointestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like obesity,
      diabetes, atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, the
      current dietary and microbial interventions to promote a healthy microbial
      profile will be reviewed.

TI  - Homeopathy for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - CD009710
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009710.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that
      leads to decreased health-related quality of life and work productivity.
      Evidence-based treatment guidelines have not been able to give guidance on the
      effects of homeopathic treatment for IBS because no systematic reviews have been 
      carried out to assess the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two
      types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review. In
      clinical homeopathy a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition.
      This differs from individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic
      remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed
      consultation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic
      treatment for treating IBS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing
      and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine
      Database (AMED), Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Register, Cochrane
      Complementary Medicine Field Specialised Register and the database of the
      Homeopathic Library (Hom-inform) from inception to February 2013. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies
      that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or
      usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.
      The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS. The overall quality of the
      evidence supporting this outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We
      calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
      continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. 
      MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs (213 participants) were included. No cohort or
      case-control studies were identified. Two studies published in 1976 and 1979
      compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy) to placebo for
      constipation-predominant IBS. One study published in 1990 compared individualised
      homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care (defined as high
      doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets asking 
      the patient to take a high fibre diet) for the treatment of IBS in female
      patients. Due to the low quality of reporting in the included studies the risk of
      bias in all three studies was unclear on most criteria and high for some
      criteria. A meta-analysis of two small studies (129 participants with
      constipation-predominant IBS) found a statistically significant difference in
      global improvement between the homeopathic remedy asafoetida and placebo at a
      short-term follow-up of two weeks. Seventy-three per cent of patients in the
      homeopathy group improved compared to 45% of placebo patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI
      1.18 to 2.18). There was no statistically significant difference in global
      improvement between the homeopathic remedies asafoetida plus nux vomica and
      placebo. Sixty-eight per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved
      compared to 52% of placebo patients (1 study, N = 42, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to
      2.15). GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcome
      global improvement as very low due to high or unknown risk of bias, short-term
      follow-up and sparse data. There was no statistically significant difference
      found between individualised homeopathic treatment and usual care (1 RCT, N = 20)
      for the outcome "feeling unwell", where the participant scored how "unwell" they 
      felt before, and after treatment (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22). None of the
      included studies reported on adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A pooled
      analysis of two small studies suggests a possible benefit for clinical
      homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with
      constipation-predominant IBS. These results should be interpreted with caution
      due to the low quality of reporting in these trials, high or unknown risk of
      bias, short-term follow-up, and sparse data. One small study found no
      statistically difference between individualised homeopathy and usual care
      (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and
      diet sheets advising a high fibre diet). No conclusions can be drawn from this
      study due to the low number of participants and the high risk of bias in this
      trial. In addition, it is likely that usual care has changed since this trial was
      conducted. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess
      the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to
      placebo or usual care.

      sensitivity and referral characteristics to secondary care.
PG  - 33-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that gluten sensitivity (GS) exists in the absence of
      coeliac disease (CD). This clinical entity has been termed noncoeliac gluten
      sensitivity (NCGS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the population prevalence of
      self-reported GS and referral characteristics to secondary care. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A UK population-based questionnaire screened for GS and related
      symptoms. Diagnostic outcomes were also analyzed in patients referred to
      secondary care with GS. CD diagnosis entailed a positive coeliac serology
      (endomysial and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies) plus Marsh 1-3 on duodenal
      biopsies. NCGS diagnosis was based on exclusion of CD. Clinical comparisons were 
      made between NCGS and CD. RESULTS: A total of 1002 adults in the population
      (female 55%, mean age 39 years). The self-reported prevalence for GS was 13%
      (female 79%, mean age 39.5 years, P<0.0001), with 3.7% consuming a gluten-free
      diet and 0.8% known to have a doctor diagnosis of CD. Individuals with GS had an 
      increased prevalence of fulfilling the Rome III criteria for irritable bowel
      syndrome, in comparison with those without GS (20 vs. 3.89%, odds ratio 6.23,
      P<0.0001).In secondary care 200 GS patients (female 84%, mean age 39.6 years)
      were investigated, in whom 7% were found to have CD and 93% to have NCGS. All CD 
      patients were human leucocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 positive compared with 53% of
      NCGS cases (P=0.0003). Nutritional deficiencies (P</=0.003), autoimmune disorders
      (23.1 vs. 9.7%, P=0.0001) and a lower mean BMI (23.7 vs. 25.8, P=0.001) were
      significantly associated with CD compared with NCGS. CONCLUSION: GS is commonly
      self-reported with symptoms suggesting an association with irritable bowel
      syndrome. The majority of patients have NCGS, an entity which demonstrates
      clinical and immunologic difference to CD.

TI  - Role of PHGG as a dietary fiber: a review article.
PG  - 329-40
AB  - AIM: Functional and metabolic effects of dietary fiber are recognized by the
      scientific, clinical and nutritional experts. Dietary fiber plays a very
      significant role in modifying the intestinal microbiota, exerting prebiotic
      effects such as stimulating the growth and/or function of beneficial intestinal
      microorganisms. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically
      considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either
      inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular
      food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials
      with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients
      with such disorders. Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum (PHGG) is a natural dietary
      fiber (Benefibra, Novartis CH Italy): it is a white powder, water-soluble,
      colorless and transparent in water solution and almost tasteless. PHGG is stable 
      and soluble at various pH levels commonly found in foods as well as resistant to 
      heat, acid, salt, high pressure and digestive enzymes. Low viscosity of PHGG
      provides a distinct advantage for the use of fiber in enteral feeding products to
      be administered through feeding tubes. It has been studied in adults, both
      healthy volunteers and patients, in different disorders such as constipation,
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), enteral nutrition, small intestine bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) and, very recently, in children suffering from functional
      abdominal pain according to the Rome III Criteria definition for functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This review takes stock of the situation
      concerning what is known to date on PHGG as dietary fiber, in order to give the
      health care professionals, such as gastroenterologists, dieticians and general
      practitioners, a complete overview on its intrinsic characteristics, preclinical 
      and clinical evaluations, uses in different situations as supportive therapy in
      the management of the main intestinal functional disorders both in adults and in 
      children. METHODS: All the papers on PHGG, published from the early 1990s of the 
      Last Century to the Year 2013, have been considered. All types of publications
      have been included. PubMed, Medline, Ovid were the main sources adopted for data 
      retrieving. RESULTS: PHGG has been studied in both animals and humans; its safety
      is well known and several clinical uses are well established. Concerning the
      modulation of metabolism in human, very little has been done to date and the
      studies have been focused, for the most part, on the functional diseases: PHGG
      has been proved to be useful in treating both IBS -C and D symptoms, not only in 
      adults but also in children; data on constipation are relatively scarce and what 
      can be deduced from the Literature is that the high concentration of fiber gives 
      the PHGG the possibility of being used effectively in acceptable dosages (up to
      22 g/day) even in situations such as chronic constipation. The use in clinical
      nutrition has revealed the flexibility of the compound which, owing to its
      peculiar characteristics, does not gel and remains liquid, PHGG can be used
      successfully in patients in enteral nutrition lowering the incidence of diarrhea.
      New open horizons can be glimpsed for SIBO treatment, lowering or maximizing the 
      antibiotics use. CONCLUSION: Not all the fibers are the same: this is a fact.
      Promoting the specific knowledge of their characteristics is very important if
      healthcare professionals want to give their patients the best options for
      functional gastrointestinal disorders or nutritional needs. PHGG (Benefiber
      Novartis CH) has been proved to be safe and effective in promoting gut health.

AB  - This article discusses the most interesting studies on functional and motility
      gastrointestinal disorders presented in Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) in 2013.
      New data were reported on the clinical importance of functional gastrointestinal 
      disorders (FGID) and on how they can produce numerous disturbances such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. These disturbances are associated with somatic
      functional disease and particularly with fatigue. In addition, new data have
      emerged on the physiopathology of these disorders, with some studies reporting
      that environmental factors and events in early infancy can favor their
      development. Data were also presented on how bile acids can increase
      susceptibility to diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and on
      how the type of food intake can favor the development of symptoms. More data are 
      available on the presence of underlying celiac disease in patients with IBS,
      which should prompt us to investigate this disease in our patients. Likewise,
      indiscriminate application of a gluten-free diet in patients with IBS has been
      shown not to produce a clear improvement. Regarding the physiopathology of
      functional dyspepsia (FD), results have been presented on how psychological
      factors can modify gastric accommodation and how this is in turn related to
      visceral hypersensitivity and gastric emptying. Regarding therapy, mirtazapine
      can improve symptoms and lead to weight gain in patients with severe FD and
      substantial weight loss. Results were presented on new drugs for IBS such as
      ibodutant and on old drugs with new applications such as mesalazine and ebastine.
      The antinociceptive effect of linaclotide is now better understood and a
      meta-analysis has shown its effectiveness in IBS with constipation as the main
      symptom. In patients with constipation, pelvic floor dysynergy can be diagnosed
      by a simple clinical interview and rectal touch. More data are available on the
      efficacy of prucalopride (which has been shown to accelerate colon transit time) 
      and data were provided on plecanatide, a potential new drug that could be useful 
      in constipation. Finally, results were presented on the use of botulinum toxin
      injection in patients with spastic motility disorders of the esophagus. Also
      worthy of mention is a study confirming a higher frequency of esophageal cancer
      patients with achalasia who receive treatment.

TI  - Indication of immune activation in patients with perceived food hypersensitivity.
PG  - 259-66
LID - 10.1007/s10620-013-2926-0 [doi]
AB  - Majority of the patients with perceived food hypersensitivity have irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), and a significant proportion of IBS patients also attribute
      their gastrointestinal complaints to food items. Different factors such as
      disturbed intestinal fermentation, enteric dysmotility, post-infectious changes
      and altered microbial flora in the colon as well as psychological disturbances
      likely play a role in the pathophysiology and symptoms generation in patients
      with food hypersensitivity. In addition, a number of studies in these patient
      groups indicate that local, systemic and mucosal immune systems are activated.
      The question now is no longer intestinal immune activation, but how the immune
      system is activated in these patients. In the following review, the potential
      pathogenetic role of the immune system and evidence of immune activation are
      reported in patients with perceived food hypersensitivity.

TI  - Non-celiac wheat sensitivity as an allergic condition: personal experience and
      narrative review.
PG  - 1845-52; quiz 1853
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.353 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a newly described clinical
      entity characterized by symptoms, which can involve the gastrointestinal tract,
      the nervous system, the skin, and other organs. There is little data on the
      pathogenesis of NCWS and it is probable that different pathogenic mechanisms are 
      involved in the different clinical manifestations of the disease. The only common
      denominator of NCWS "syndrome" is wheat consumption: the symptoms disappear on
      exclusion of wheat from the diet, and reappear on wheat consumption. The
      objective of this study was to review our prior data regarding NCWS and to review
      relevant medical literature regarding NCWS, with particular attention to the
      hypothesis that NCWS patients could suffer from non-immunoglobulin E
      (IgE)-mediated wheat allergy. METHODS: We reviewed our data on 276 patients
      diagnosed with NCWS by means of double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat
      challenge. The data indicating a possible wheat allergy diagnosis were examined
      and other data in the literature were reviewed; we review the role of serum
      immunoglobulin G antibodies and the basophil activation assay in food allergy,
      and the histology findings in the food allergy diagnosis. RESULTS: The comparison
      between patients suffering from NCWS and presenting with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) and controls with IBS not due to NCWS showed that NCWS was characterized
      by: a personal history of food allergy in the pediatric age (0.01), coexistent
      atopic diseases (0.0001), positive serum anti-gliadin (0.0001) and
      anti-betalactoglobulin (0.001) antibodies, positive cytofluorimetric assay
      revealing in vitro basophil activation by food antigens (0.0001), and a presence 
      of eosinophils in the intestinal mucosa biopsies (0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients 
      with NCWS and multiple food sensitivity show several clinical, laboratory, and
      histological characteristics that suggest they might be suffering from
      non-IgE-mediated food allergy. However, other pathogenic mechanisms need to be
      considered.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder,
      characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain with constipation, diarrhea 
      and/or an alternation of the two, and often bloating. Complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) consists of a group of medical treatments that are not
      commonly considered to be a part of traditional medicine. CAM is commonly used
      for difficult-to-treat chronic medical conditions. Many patients choose CAM
      because there are only a limited number of treatments available for IBS or
      because they would like to have a 'natural therapy'. Mind-body therapies for IBS 
      have proven efficacy, but have not been well accepted by patients or
      practitioners for treatment. This article reviews the use of CAM and mind-body
      therapies in IBS, with a focus on probiotics, acupuncture, herbal medicines and
      psychological therapies.

TI  - Consumption of spicy foods and the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 6465-71
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i38.6465 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the association between consumption of spicy foods and prevalence
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, data from 4763 Iranian adult participants were used.
      Consumption of spicy foods was estimated using a dietary habits questionnaire
      that included a question on spicy foods consumption: "how frequently do you use
      spicy foods (pepper, curry, ginger, cinnamon and turmeric) during a week?"
      Participants could respond to the question by choosing one of these choices:
      never, 1-3 times, 4-6 times, 7-9 times, or more than 10 times per week. A
      modified Persian version of the Rome III questionnaire was used to determine the 
      prevalence of IBS. RESULTS: IBS was prevalent in 21.7% (18.6% of men and 24.1% of
      women) of the study population. After controlling for potential confounders
      including dietary behaviors, those consuming spicy foods >/= 10 times per week
      were 92% more likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy
      foods (OR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.23-3.01, P trend < 0.01). The association remained
      significant even after taking lactose intolerance into account (OR = 1.85; 95%CI:
      1.18-2.90, P trend < 0.01). Stratified analysis by gender revealed that the
      association between consumption of spicy foods and IBS was not significant in
      men; however, a significant association was found among women after taking
      potential cofounders, including meal regularity and lactose intolerance, into
      account. Women who consumed spicy foods >/= 10 times per week were two times more
      likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy foods (OR = 2.03;
      95%CI: 1.09-3.77, P trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Consumption of spicy foods is
      directly associated with IBS, particularly in women. Further, prospective studies
      are warranted to (1) examine this association in other populations; and (2)
      evaluate whether dietary interventions, for example a reduction in spice
      consumption, would improve IBS symptoms.

AB  - This study analyses 127 communications from individuals self-reporting their
      weight change following adoption of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) eating
      plan. Total combined self-reported weight loss was 1 900 kg (range 5 kg gain to
      84 kg loss). The mean +/- standard deviation weight loss of 15 (+/-12) kg is
      among the largest yet described. Sixteen subjects reported the LCHF 'cured' (i.e.
      medications no longer required) one or more of their medical conditions, most
      commonly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n=14), hypertension (n=8) and
      hypercholesterolaemia (n=7). Another 9 subjects with either type 1 diabetes
      mellitus or T2DM reduced medications as did 7 patients with hypertension; 8 no
      longer suffered from irritable bowel syndrome. These data show that significant
      and rapid weight loss is possible on an unsupervised eating plan that severely
      restricts daily carbohydrate intake to approximately &lt;75 g/day. Better weight 
      loss on a carbohydrate-restricted LCHF eating plan than on an iso-caloric
      high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet is well described in the literature,
      probably due to a paradoxical reduction of hunger by carbohydrate restriction. A 
      randomised controlled clinical trial is urgently required to disprove the
      hypothesis that the LCHF eating plan can reverse cases of T2DM, metabolic
      syndrome and hypertension without pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Functional bowel symptoms and diet.
PG  - 1067-74
LID - 10.1111/imj.12266 [doi]
AB  - It is well recognised that ingestion of food is a trigger for functional bowel
      symptoms, particularly those associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Patients often use manipulation of diet as a means of controlling symptoms.
      Despite description of multiple dietary methods, few have scientific backing or
      quality evidence of efficacy. One approach is to define how specific food
      components influence the pathophysiology of IBS and then rationally design
      dietary approaches. For example, short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP)) cause luminal
      distension, which is a major stimulus for the development of symptoms in patients
      with visceral hypersensitivity. By determining food content of FODMAP, a diet in 
      which foods low in FODMAP are favoured over those high in FODMAP can be designed.
      Observational, comparative and randomised controlled treatment and rechallenge
      studies have shown that such an approach is efficacious in the majority of
      patients with IBS. The low FODMAP diet is now the primary dietary therapy for
      such patients. Similar approaches can be applied to other food components,
      including proteins (such as gluten), fats and natural bioactive food chemicals.
      Such approaches have suggestions of efficacy, but the evidence base remains
      underdeveloped. An additional and important consideration for any dietary therapy
      is its nutritional adequacy and potential adverse health effects. Dietary
      manipulation is now a key management strategy in patients with functional bowel
      symptoms. Future well-designed interventional studies will lead to refinement of 
      dietary approaches taken and to a better understanding of their long-term safety.

TI  - Taste receptors of the gut: emerging roles in health and disease.
PG  - 179-90
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305112 [doi]
AB  - Recent progress in unravelling the nutrient-sensing mechanisms in the taste buds 
      of the tongue has triggered studies on the existence and role of chemosensory
      cells in the gut. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the key interface between
      food and the human body and can sense basic tastes in much the same way as the
      tongue, through the use of similar G-protein-coupled taste receptors. These
      receptors 'taste' the luminal content and transmit signals that regulate nutrient
      transporter expression and nutrient uptake, and also the release of gut hormones 
      and neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of energy and glucose
      homeostasis. Hence, they play a prominent role in the communication between the
      lumen, epithelium, smooth muscle cells, afferent nerve fibres and the brain to
      trigger adaptive responses that affect gastrointestinal function, food intake and
      glucose metabolism. This review summarises how sensing of nutrients by taste
      receptors along the gut plays a key role in the process of digestion, and how
      disturbances or adaptations of these chemosensory signalling pathways may
      contribute to the induction or resolution of a number of pathological conditions 
      related to diabetes, obesity, or diet-induced symptom generation in irritable
      bowel syndrome. Targeting these receptors may represent a promising novel route
      for the treatment of a number of these diseases.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common gastrointestinal problems. It is
      characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in 
      stool frequency and/or consistency. The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be
      multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in 
      gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut 
      epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain
      psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory.
      There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal
      microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in
      certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition.
      Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract.
      Recently, many studies have suggested that probiotics are effective in the
      treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex. The
      purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and mechanisms for the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of IBS.

TI  - Non-Celiac Gluten sensitivity: the new frontier of gluten related disorders.
PG  - 3839-53
LID - 10.3390/nu5103839 [doi]
AB  - Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and
      recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and
      extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in 
      subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy
      (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been
      generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical
      studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human
      disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been 
      detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies
      suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders,
      particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children
      have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical
      studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related
      disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat
      amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain
      carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS)
      experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and
      current trends on NCGS.

TI  - A diet low in FODMAPs reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 67-75.e5

LID - S0016-5085(13)01407-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) often is used to manage functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet
      there is limited evidence of its efficacy, compared with a normal Western diet.
      We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian 
      diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients
      with IBS. METHODS: In a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals
      (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from
      subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups 
      that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian
      diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to
      the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual
      analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet
      periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the
      low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for
      frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating. RESULTS:
      Subjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95%
      confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with 
      the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and
      the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were
      reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and
      unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater
      satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but
      diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and
      King's Stool Chart scores. CONCLUSIONS: In a controlled, cross-over study of
      patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a
      first-line therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: ACTRN12612001185853.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent, costly, and potentially
      disabling gastrointestinal disorder. Medical education is among the most
      challenging and the most stressful education, and this may predispose to high
      rates of IBS. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and predictors of IBS among 
      medical students and interns in King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 597 medical students and
      interns selected by multistage stratified random sample method in 2012. A
      confidential, anonymous, and self-administered questionnaire was used to collect 
      personal and sociodemographic data, level of emotional stress, and food
      hypersensitivity during the past 6 months. Rome III Criteria and the Standardized
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were also used. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      IBS was 31.8%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the first
      predictor of IBS was female gender (aOR=2.89; 95.0% CI: 1.65-5.05). The second
      predictor was presence of morbid anxiety (aOR=2.44; 95.0% CI: 1.30-4.55). Living 
      in a school dormitory, emotional stress during 6 months preceding the study, and 
      the academic year were the next predictors. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of IBS
      prevailed among medical students and interns. Female gender, morbid anxiety,
      living in school dormitory, emotional stress, and higher educational level
      (grade) were the predictors of IBS. Screening of medical students for IBS,
      psychological problems, and reducing stress by stress management are recommended.

AB  - At best, currently available therapies provide symptomatic relief from functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). No existing therapy, however, can influence the
      natural course of any of these disorders, prompting interest in new and safe
      treatment options. This paper summarizes the clinical evidence from randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses of the effectiveness of
      probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary fiber in the treatment of FGD in the
      pediatric population. While it is too soon to recommend the routine use of any
      probiotics for treating FGD, some of these therapeutic options can provide a
      health benefit to patients, and therefore can be discussed with patients and/or
      caregivers. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has consistently improved symptoms of
      infantile colic. The use of Lactobacillus GG moderately increased treatment
      success in children with abdominal pain-related FGD, particularly among children 
      with irritable bowel syndrome. Also, data from one trial suggest that VSL#3 seems
      to be effective in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life of
      children affected by irritable bowel syndrome. L. reuteri DSM 17938 may help
      infants with constipation. Limited evidence suggests that administration of a
      fiber supplement is more effective than placebo for the treatment of childhood
      constipation.

PG  - 1600-6
LID - 10.1093/cid/cit555 [doi]
AB  - Campylobacteriosis in humans, caused by Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter
      coli, is the most common recognized bacterial zoonosis in the European Union and 
      the United States. The acute phase is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms.
      The long-term sequelae (Guillain-Barre syndrome, reactive arthritis, and
      postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome) contribute considerably to the disease
      burden. Attribution studies identified poultry as the reservoir responsible for
      up to 80% of the human Campylobacter infections. In the European Union, an
      estimated 30% of the human infections are associated with consumption and
      preparation of poultry meat. Until now, interventions in the poultry meat
      production chain have not been effectively introduced except for targeted
      interventions in Iceland and New Zealand. Intervention measures (eg, biosecurity)
      have limited effect or are hampered by economic aspects or consumer acceptance.
      In the future, a multilevel approach should be followed, aiming at reducing the
      level of contamination of consumer products rather than complete absence of
      Campylobacter.

AB  - Foodborne infections with Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes,
      Salmonella, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, and other pathogens can result in
      long-term sequelae to numerous organ systems. These include irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, reactive arthritis, hemolytic uremic
      syndrome, chronic kidney disease, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, neurological disorders
      from acquired and congenital listeriosis and toxoplasmosis, and cognitive and
      developmental deficits due to diarrheal malnutrition or severe acute illness. A
      full understanding of the long-term sequelae of foodborne infection is important 
      both for individual patient management by clinicians, as well as to inform food
      safety and public health decision making.

PG  - 339
AB  - Diverticulosis and its major complications, diverticulitis and diverticular
      bleeding, are increasingly common indications for hospitalization and outpatient 
      visits. Recent publications in the field of diverticular disease have challenged 
      long-standing disease concepts and management strategies. This article will
      highlight studies which have helped to clarify the contribution of genetic
      factors, fiber consumption and medication use to the development of diverticular 
      disease, the role of antibiotics in the treatment of acute diverticulitis, and
      the association between diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and colon
      cancer.

TI  - Systematic review: probiotics in the management of lower gastrointestinal
      symptoms in clinical practice -- an evidence-based international guide.
PG  - 864-86
LID - 10.1111/apt.12460 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota play an important role in
      gastrointestinal problems. AIM: To give clinicians a practical reference guide on
      the role of specified probiotics in managing particular lower gastrointestinal
      symptoms/problems by means of a systematic review-based consensus. METHODS:
      Systematic literature searching identified randomised, placebo-controlled trials 
      in adults; evidence for each symptom/problem was graded and statements developed 
      (consensus process; 10-member panel). As results cannot be generalised between
      different probiotics, individual probiotics were identified for each statement.
      RESULTS: Thirty seven studies were included; mostly on irritable bowel syndrome
      [IBS; 19 studies; treatment responder rates: 18-80% (specific probiotics), 5-50% 
      (placebo)] or antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD; 10 studies). Statements with 
      100% agreement and 'high' evidence levels indicated that: (i) specific probiotics
      help reduce overall symptom burden and abdominal pain in some IBS patients; (ii) 
      in patients receiving antibiotics/Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy,
      specified probiotics are helpful as adjuvants to prevent/reduce the
      duration/intensity of AAD; (iii) probiotics have favourable safety in patients in
      primary care. Items with 70-100% agreement and 'moderate' evidence were: (i)
      specific probiotics help relieve overall symptom burden in some patients with
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS, and reduce bloating/distension and improve bowel
      movement frequency/consistency in some IBS patients and (ii) with some
      probiotics, improved symptoms have led to improvement in quality of life.
      CONCLUSIONS: Specified probiotics can provide benefit in IBS and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea; relatively few studies in other indications
      suggested benefits warranting further research. This study provides practical
      guidance on which probiotic to select for a specific problem.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a natural reservoir of microbiota. The gut is
      germ-free at birth, but rapidly becomes host to various bacteria establishing a
      progressively mutual relationship. The composition of gut microbiota is
      individual-specific and depends on the genotype of the host and environmental
      factors. Novel techniques have been used to characterize gastrointestinal
      microbiota, including genomic approaches. The bacterial profile shows that
      dominant and minor phyla are present in the gastrointestinal tract. From the
      proximal to the distal segments of the gut the bacterial density gradually
      increases, reaching an estimated 10(11) to 10(12) bacteria per gram of colonic
      content. Dynamic interactions between gut and microbiota play a physiological
      role in metabolic, protective and structural functions, while dysbiosis
      contributes to several diseases. Microbiota appear to play a role in IBS, where
      qualitative and quantitative changes of bacteriaoccur in IBS subtypes. Initial
      therapeutic approaches in IBS have focused on microbiota. The relationship
      between perturbations of the microbiota, mucosal inflammation and IBS remains to 
      be further investigated.

TI  - Long-term treatment with probiotics in primary care patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome--a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Meta-analyses have indicated effect of probiotics on irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). However, few long-term trials have been conducted and uncertainty
      remains as to effectiveness and long-term effect in a primary care setting. We
      aimed to investigate the effect of probiotics compared with placebo in the
      management of IBS in primary care during a 6-month treatment period and with a
      6-month follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We randomized IBS patients fulfilling
      Rome III criteria to receive two capsules twice daily either containing placebo
      or a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19,
      Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium Bb12 in an amount of 1.3 x
      10(10) CFU per capsule. Primary endpoint was proportion of responders defined as 
      patients reporting adequate relief (AR) at least 50% of the time in the 6-month
      treatment period. Secondary outcomes were proportions of patients reporting AR at
      different time points, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related
      quality of life (HrQOL) from baseline to 6 and 12 months. RESULTS. A total of 131
      patients were included in this study. The proportion of responders in the
      treatment period was 52% (35/67) in the probiotic group versus 41% (26/64) in the
      placebo group, p = 0.18. Overall we found no difference between the groups in
      change in gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment. Patients improved in HrQOL, 
      but with no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION. 
      During a 6-month treatment period, we were not able to detect a positive effect
      of probiotic when compared with placebo.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, diet and health.
PG  - 387-402
LID - 10.1017/S0007114513002560 [doi]
AB  - The human intestine is colonised by 10(1)(3) to 10(1)(4) micro-organisms, the
      vast majority of which belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Although
      highly stable over time, the composition and activities of the microbiota may be 
      influenced by a number of factors including age, diet and antibiotic treatment.
      Although perturbations in the composition or functions of the microbiota are
      linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome and obesity), it is unclear at this point whether these 
      changes are a symptom of the disease or a contributing factor. A better knowledge
      of the mechanisms through which changes in microbiota composition (dysbiosis)
      promote disease states is needed to improve our understanding of the causal
      relationship between the gut microbiota and disease. While evidence of the
      preventive and therapeutic effects of probiotic strains on diarrhoeal illness and
      other intestinal conditions is promising, the exact mechanisms of the beneficial 
      effects are not fully understood. Recent studies have raised the question of
      whether non-viable probiotic strains can confer health benefits on the host by
      influencing the immune system. As the potential health effect of these non-viable
      bacteria depends on whether the mechanism of this effect is dependent on
      viability, future research needs to consider each probiotic strain on a
      case-by-case basis. The present review provides a comprehensive, updated overview
      of the human gut microbiota, the factors influencing its composition and the role
      of probiotics as a therapeutic modality in the treatment and prevention of
      diseases and/or restoration of human health.

TI  - A pilot study on the effect of a symbiotic mixture in irritable bowel syndrome:
      an open-label, partially controlled, 6-month extension of a previously published 
      trial.
PG  - 345-53
LID - 10.1007/s10151-013-1055-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the efficacy of probiotics has received considerable
      attention in the treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this regard, a 
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul((R))) has shown beneficial effects. The aim of this
      study was to extend the previously published 4-week randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study of this symbiotic mixture. METHODS: This is an
      open-label prospective, partially controlled, 6-month extension period pilot
      study in which patients continued to receive the symbiotic mixture (Group 1) or
      were switched from placebo to symbiotic mixture (Group 2) using cyclic
      administration (last 2 weeks/month). The primary endpoints were the overall
      satisfactory relief of bloating and flatulence (assessed as proportions of
      responders). The secondary endpoints were evaluation of the symptom severity
      scores (bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency) and bowel function scores
      (frequency, consistency and incomplete evacuation). RESULTS: Twenty-six IBS
      patients completed the 6-month extension period (13 patients in Group 1 and 13
      patients in Group 2). In the per-protocol analysis, the proportions of responders
      across time were not significantly different in the groups but in Group 2, there 
      was an increased percentage of responders for flatulence (p = 0.07). In addition,
      the score of flatulence was reduced significantly during the 6-month treatment
      period in Group 2 (p < 0.05), while no other significant differences were
      detected. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with this symbiotic mixture was associated with 
      persistence of relief from flatulence or new reduction in flatulence in the
      present 6-month long extension study. These results need to be more
      comprehensively assessed in large, long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled
      studies.

TI  - Dietary sorbitol and mannitol: food content and distinct absorption patterns
      between healthy individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 263-75
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorbitol and mannitol are naturally-occurring polyol isomers.
      Although poor absorption and induction of gastrointestinal symptoms by sorbitol
      are known, the properties of mannitol are poorly described. We aimed to expand
      data on food composition of these polyols, and to compare their absorptive
      capacities and symptom induction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
      and healthy individuals. METHODS: Food samples were analysed for sorbitol and
      mannitol content. The degree of absorption measured by breath hydrogen production
      and gastrointestinal symptoms (visual analogue scales) was evaluated in a
      randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 21 healthy and 20 IBS
      subjects after challenges with 10 g of sorbitol, mannitol or glucose. RESULTS:
      Certain fruits and sugar-free gum contained sorbitol, whereas mannitol content
      was higher in certain vegetables. Similar proportions of patients with IBS (40%) 
      and healthy subjects (33%) completely absorbed sorbitol, although more so with
      IBS absorbed mannitol (80% versus 43%; P = 0.02). Breath hydrogen production was 
      similar in both groups after lactulose but was reduced in patients with IBS after
      both polyols. No difference in mean (SEM) hydrogen production was found in
      healthy controls after sorbitol [area-under-the-curve: 2766 (591) ppm 4 h(-1) ]
      or mannitol [2062 (468) ppm 4 h(-1) ] but, in patients with IBS, this was greater
      after sorbitol [1136 (204) ppm 4 h(-1) ] than mannitol [404 (154) ppm 4 h(-1) ; P
      = 0.002]. Overall gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly after both
      polyols in patients with IBS only, although they were independent of
      malabsorption of either of the polyols. CONCLUSIONS: Increased and discordant
      absorption of mannitol and sorbitol occurs in patients with IBS compared to that 
      in healthy controls. Polyols induced gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with
      IBS independently of their absorptive patterns, suggesting that the dietary
      restriction of polyols may be efficacious.

TI  - The relationship of food intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome in adults.
PG  - 275-82
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e31829ed911 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this literature review is to develop a thorough understanding of
      the research on food intolerance and its relationship to irritable bowel
      syndrome. Knowledge of the connection between the two conditions will assist
      allied healthcare professionals in working with patients to better manage their
      symptoms. Reduced healthcare costs may also result if patients are able to
      identify problematic foods and experience symptom improvement with diet changes. 
      The review consists of an overview of food intolerance including prevalence,
      specific foods implicated including an in-depth review of research on bulk
      sweeteners, as well as methods of diagnosis. In addition, prevalence, specific
      foods associated with food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome patients such 
      as carbohydrates and lipids, nutritional consequences of food intolerance, and
      possible food-related methods of treatment including increased fiber intake are
      discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research and possible directions
      allied healthcare professionals can start with in assisting patients are
      provided.

TI  - A common cause of irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulitis: chronic distal
      colon distention from sedentary behavior and excessive dietary fiber.
PG  - 413-9
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2013.811043 [doi]
AB  - A multidisciplinary analysis restricted to validated reports was applied to the
      cause and management of irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular formation and
      subsequent diverticulitis. There is evidence that they are linked - both caused
      by attenuation of gravitational aid to distal intestinal motility, resulting in
      damaging chronic intestinal distention. Both irritable bowel syndrome and
      diverticular formation and subsequent diverticulitis have worsened in recent
      years owing to excessive dietary fiber intake. Potential solutions include
      augmenting weight-bearing time, moderating dietary fiber consumption, stimulating
      distal colon evacuation through chemical means and developing pharmaceuticals to 
      block the reflexive distal colon distention associated with fiber consumption.
      Amplified intestinal distention commenced when all classes of Renaissance
      Europeans became the first group in human history to wear shoes, which led to a
      sedentary lifestyle that moderates gravitational aid to colon motility and
      evacuation.

TI  - Surveillance for travel-related disease--GeoSentinel Surveillance System, United 
      States, 1997-2011.
PG  - 1-23
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: In 2012, the number of international tourist arrivals
      worldwide was projected to reach a new high of 1 billion arrivals, a 48% increase
      from 674 million arrivals in 2000. International travel also is increasing among 
      U.S. residents. In 2009, U.S. residents made approximately 61 million trips
      outside the country, a 5% increase from 1999. Travel-related morbidity can occur 
      during or after travel. Worldwide, 8% of travelers from industrialized to
      developing countries report becoming ill enough to seek health care during or
      after travel. Travelers have contributed to the global spread of infectious
      diseases, including novel and emerging pathogens. Therefore, surveillance of
      travel-related morbidity is an essential component of global public health
      surveillance and will be of greater importance as international travel increases 
      worldwide. REPORTING PERIOD: September 1997-December 2011. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM:
      GeoSentinel is a clinic-based global surveillance system that tracks infectious
      diseases and other adverse health outcomes in returned travelers, foreign
      visitors, and immigrants. GeoSentinel comprises 54 travel/tropical medicine
      clinics worldwide that electronically submit demographic, travel, and clinical
      diagnosis data for all patients evaluated for an illness or other health
      condition that is presumed to be related to international travel. Clinical
      information is collected by physicians with expertise or experience in
      travel/tropical medicine. Data collected at all sites are entered electronically 
      into a database, which is housed at and maintained by CDC. The GeoSentinel
      network membership program comprises 235 additional clinics in 40 countries on
      six continents. Although these network members do not report surveillance data
      systematically, they can report unusual or concerning diagnoses in travelers and 
      might be asked to perform enhanced surveillance in response to specific health
      events or concerns. RESULTS: During September 1997-December 2011, data were
      collected on 141,789 patients with confirmed or probable travel-related
      diagnoses. Of these, 23,006 (16%) patients were evaluated in the United States,
      10,032 (44%) of whom were evaluated after returning from travel outside of the
      United States (i.e., after-travel patients). Of the 10,032 after-travel patients,
      4,977 (50%) were female, 4,856 (48%) were male, and 199 (2%) did not report sex; 
      the median age was 34 years. Most were evaluated in outpatient settings (84%),
      were born in the United States (76%), and reported current U.S. residence (99%). 
      The most common reasons for travel were tourism (38%),
      missionary/volunteer/research/aid work (24%), visiting friends and relatives
      (17%), and business (15%). The most common regions of exposure were Sub-Saharan
      Africa (23%), Central America (15%), and South America (12%). Fewer than half
      (44%) reported having had a pretravel visit with a health-care provider. Of the
      13,059 diagnoses among the 10,032 after-travel patients, the most common
      diagnoses were acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%),
      postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (5%), giardiasis (3%), and chronic
      unknown diarrhea (3%). The most common diagnostic groupings were acute diarrhea
      (22%), nondiarrheal gastrointestinal (15%), febrile/systemic illness (14%), and
      dermatologic (12%). Among 1,802 patients with febrile/systemic illness diagnoses,
      the most common diagnosis was Plasmodium falciparum malaria (19%). The rapid
      communication component of the GeoSentinel network has allowed prompt responses
      to important health events affecting travelers; during 2010 and 2011, the
      notification capability of the GeoSentinel network was used in the identification
      and public health response to East African trypanosomiasis in Eastern Zambia and 
      North Central Zimbabwe, P. vivax malaria in Greece, and muscular sarcocystosis on
      Tioman Island, Malaysia. INTERPRETATION: The GeoSentinel Global Surveillance
      System is the largest repository of provider-based data on travel-related
      illness. Among ill travelers evaluated in U.S. GeoSentinel sites after returning 
      from international travel, gastrointestinal diagnoses were most frequent,
      suggesting that U.S. travelers might be exposed to unsafe food and water while
      traveling internationally. The most common febrile/systemic diagnosis was P.
      falciparum malaria, suggesting that some U.S. travelers to malarial areas are not
      receiving or using proper malaria chemoprophylaxis or mosquito-bite avoidance
      measures. The finding that fewer than half of all patients reported having made a
      pretravel visit with a health-care provider indicates that a substantial portion 
      of U.S. travelers might not be following CDC travelers' health recommendations
      for international travel. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: GeoSentinel surveillance data
      have helped researchers define an evidence base for travel medicine that has
      informed travelers' health guidelines and the medical evaluation of ill
      international travelers. These data suggest that persons traveling
      internationally from the United States to developing countries remain at risk for
      illness. Health-care providers should help prepare travelers properly for safe
      travel and provide destination-specific medical evaluation of returning ill
      travelers. Training for health-care providers should focus on preventing and
      treating a variety of travel-related conditions, particularly traveler's diarrhea
      and malaria.

TI  - Assessment of abdominal pain through global outcomes and recent FDA
      recommendations in children: are we ready for change?
PG  - 46-50
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182a20764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome is a multisymptom construct, with abdominal 
      pain (AP) acting as the driving symptom of patient-reported severity. The Food
      and Drug Administration considers a >30% decrease in AP as satisfactory
      improvement, but this has not been validated in children. We investigated the
      correspondence of 2 measures for AP assessment, >/=30% improvement in AP and
      global assessment of improvement. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from 72
      children who completed a randomized clinical trial for abdominal pain-associated 
      functional gastrointestinal disorders. Children completed daily assessment of AP 
      intensity, functional disability inventory (FDI), question regarding pain's
      interference with activities, and 2 global assessment questions. We measured the 
      extent to which >/=30% improvement of AP and global assessment questions
      correlated with each other and with disability. RESULTS: The global questions
      correlated with each other (r=0.74; P<0.0001) and with a >/=30% improvement in AP
      (P<0.01). Global outcomes were satisfaction with treatment was inversely related 
      to the child's report of interference with activities (P<0.01) and symptom relief
      was positively associated with >/=30% improvement in FDI scores (P<0.009). A 30% 
      change in FDI scores was associated with global questions of symptom relief
      (P=0.009) but not with satisfaction with treatment (P=0.07). The association of
      AP improvement with interference with activities (P=0.14) or change in FDI scores
      (P=0.27) did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used global
      assessments are significantly associated with decreased pain intensity, decreased
      interference with daily activities, and a >/=30% change in FDI scores, whereas
      recommended 30% improvement in pain intensity is not as comprehensive.

PG  - 936-43
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.812139 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To perform a validation of dairy registrations for use as diagnostic 
      tool in IBS and fructose malabsorption (FM). To investigate the precision of the 
      fructose breath test (FBT) as compared with symptom score reduction on
      fructose-reduced diet (FRD) in a cohort of patients with Rome II defined
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). DESIGN: IBS patients diagnosed according to the
      Rome II criteria and with no organic gastrointestinal disease were enrolled. The 
      patients were randomized in an open study design with a 2 week run-in on IBS
      diet, followed by 4 weeks w/wo additional FRD. FBT was performed in all patients.
      Dairy registrations of stool frequency and consistency as well as abdominal
      pain/discomfort and bloating on a visual analog scale (VAS) were performed during
      the whole study. RESULTS: A total of 182 subjects performed the study according
      to protocol (88 FRD, 94 controls). The VAS symptom registration performed well in
      validation procedures, whereas stool data showed less impressive characteristics.
      FRD improved symptom scores (abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating)
      significantly whereas no changes were observed in the control group. The effect
      of FRD on the stool frequency was modest but no effect was observed on the stool 
      consistency. The FBT did not discriminate between patients with and without
      effect of FRD, and even in the group with a negative FBT significant improvement 
      of symptom scores was observed. CONCLUSION: VAS measures yield reliable symptom
      evaluation in dairy registrations of IBS. FRD improves symptom scores in IBS
      patients independent of results from the FBT.

TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The efficacy of treatment with multispecies probiotics on
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the alterations of gut microbiota in 
      patients who have taken probiotics were investigated. METHODS: This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 IBS patients (probiotics: 25, 
      placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Patients were randomly
      assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of
      Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L.
      rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive 
      a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was the
      proportion of participants whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week
      4. Secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4
      weeks. Fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo:
      17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The
      proportion of patients whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4
      was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0%
      (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (P < 0.05). Secondary end-points such as improvement 
      in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but
      not in the placebo group. Fecal analysis revealed that B. lactis, L. rhamnosus,
      and S. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4
      weeks and that B. lactis had increased in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Multispecies probiotics are effective in IBS patients and induce the alterations 
      in the composition of intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Diet is important in triggering the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      This study investigated the impact of dietary guidance on the symptoms, quality
      of life and habitual diet of patients with IBS. Forty-six patients who fulfilled 
      the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS were included. Of these patients, 
      17 completed the entire study. Each patient attended three sessions (~45 min in
      duration) and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The
      patients were asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to receiving
      the dietary guidance, and at least 3 months subsequently: The Birmingham IBS
      symptom score questionnaire, the IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire, the
      Short-Form Nepean and Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI) and the MoBa Food Frequency
      Questionnaire (MoBa FFQ). The time at which patients completed the questionnaires
      following dietary guidance ranged from 3-9 months (median, 4 months). The total
      IBS symptom scores were reduced once the patients had received dietary guidance
      (P=0.001). The total score for the quality of life, as assessed by the IBSQOL and
      the SF-NDI, increased significantly following the dietary guidance sessions
      (P=0.003 and P=0.002, respectively). There were no statistical differences in the
      intake of calories, carbohydrate, fiber, protein, fat or alcohol in the patients 
      with IBS following dietary guidance. There were increases in the consumption of
      dairy products, beta-carotene, retinol equivalents, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and
      calcium, although only the increase in vitamin B12 consumption was statistically 
      significant. There was a significant reduction in the consumption of certain
      fruits and vegetables that were rich in highly fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, as well as insoluble
      fibers. In conclusion, three 45-min dietary guidance sessions, administered by a 
      nurse, reduced the symptoms and improved the quality of life of patients with
      IBS, and resulted in an adequate intake of vitamins and minerals. Individual
      dietary guidance is a cost-effective option for the management of IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract. This highly prevalent condition is best diagnosed by
      assessing the constellation of symptoms with which patients present to their
      physicians. Because some critics have previously questioned whether irritable
      bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders truly exist
      because they do not have defining structural features, the Rome Foundation
      fostered the use of symptom-based criteria for universal use. In most cases
      treatment is reduced to symptomatic therapy because a lot of unknown in
      pathogenesis by irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome leads to
      decrease of quality of life of the patients and could be one of the reasons of
      patients' disability. Food is believed by patients promotes symptoms and the diet
      or avoiding specific food can reduce symptoms. Possible role of different food
      and microbiota in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome, as well as the
      data from randomized, controlled clinical trials dedicated to the effects of diet
      in irritable bowel syndrome are summarized and discussed in this review. The
      efficacy of the diet, enriched by fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, peppermint oil, 
      curcumin and vitamin B6 in irritable bowel syndrome patients was shown in
      numerous studies. In some studies restriction in consumption of fermented
      carbohydrates, coffee and alcohol, as well as diet with elimination IgG-sensed
      food was also shown to be effective in irritable bowel syndrome. Food
      intolerances, defined as non-toxic non-immune adverse reactions to food, include 
      reactions to bioactive chemicals in foods and metabolic reactions to poorly
      absorbed dietary carbohydrates. New dietary approaches like polyunsaturated fatty
      acids intake correction and the low tryptophan intake are discussed.

      syndrome.
PG  - 1624-31
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the gut microbiota may be 
      altered. Probiotic bacteria appear to be therapeutically effective. We
      characterized the mucosa-associated microbiota, and determined the clinical and
      microbiological effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria, in patients
      with IBS. METHODS: Mucosal microbiota from rectal biopsies of IBS patients and
      controls were assessed on the V1 and V2 variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA
      gene amplified using 454 pyrosequencing. Clinical symptoms and changes in mucosal
      microbiota were assessed in IBS patients before and after 4 weeks of treatment
      with probiotic mix VSL#3. RESULTS: Ten IBS subjects (eight female; mean age 46
      years) were included. At week 4 of probiotic therapy, six patients showed symptom
      improvement on global symptom assessment compared with baseline (P = 0.031).
      Before therapy, intestinal microbiota of IBS subjects differed significantly from
      that of healthy controls, with less diversity and evenness than controls (n = 9; 
      P < 0.05), increased abundance of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.014) and Synegitestes (P =
      0.017), and reduced abundance of Actinobacteria (P = 0.004). The classes
      Flavobacteria (P = 0.028) and Epsilonproteobacteria (P = 0.017) were less
      enriched in IBS. Abundance differences were largely consistent from the phylum to
      genus level. Probiotic treatment in IBS patients was associated with a
      significant reduction of the genus Bacteroides (all taxonomy levels; P < 0.05) to
      levels similar to that of controls. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, global and
      deep molecular analysis demonstrates an altered mucosal microbiota composition in
      IBS. Probiotic leads to detectable changes in the microbiota. These effects of
      probiotic bacteria may contribute to their therapeutic benefit.

PG  - 1295-301
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal
      disorder. The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III criteria in young Japanese
      women and to assess the effects of mental, physical, dietary and nutritional
      factors on IBS. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data obtained from
      self-administered questionnaires, including age, height, weight, lifestyle, food 
      habits, anxiety and depressive states and IBS-related symptoms, were analyzed in 
      245 participants. An established semiquantitative questionnaire available for
      clinical investigation (FFQg) was used to obtain a detailed assessment of food
      intake and the physical activity levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was
      12.0%. Of the IBS participants, constipation-predominant IBS (25.0%) was more
      prevalent than the diarrhea-predominant subtype (17.9%). The IBS participants had
      lower body mass indices, consumed less eggs and milk and were more physically
      active than the non-IBS participants. In addition, an anxiety state was more
      common in the IBS participants. Those who hesitated with evacuation of stool and 
      who thought that there is an association between abdominal symptoms, such as
      constipation and diarrhea, and menstruation were more predominant among the IBS
      participants. The percentage of individuals who reported often rushing to the
      toilet within the past year and experiencing borborygmus (rumbling stomach) was
      greater among the IBS participants. A logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      milk intake was an independent predictor of IBS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of
      IBS observed in this study was similar to that reported in previous studies
      conducted in Japan and other countries. Mental, physical, dietary and nutritional
      factors have an impact on IBS.

PG  - 954-67
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2011.574803 [doi]
AB  - Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterraenea (L.) verdc) (BGN) is a legume; its origin
      have been traced back to Africa, and it is the third important legume; however,
      it is one of the neglected crops. It is highly nutritious, and has been termed a 
      complete food. Its seed consist of 49%-63.5% carbohydrate, 15%-25% protein,
      4.5%-7.4% fat, 5.2%-6.4% fiber, 3.2%-4.4% ash and 2% mineral compared to whole
      fresh cow milk 88% moisture, 4.8% carbohydrate, 3.2% proteins, 3.4% fat, 0.7%
      ash, and 0.01% cholesterol. Its chemical composition is comparable to that of soy
      bean. Furthermore, BGN has been reported to be a potential crop, owing to its
      nutritional composition, functional properties, antioxidant potential, and a
      drought resistant crop. Bambara groundnut milk (BGNM) had been rated higher in
      acceptability than milk from other legumes like soybean and cowpea. Probiotics
      have been defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate
      amount confer a health benefit on the host. These benefits have been reported to 
      be therapeutic, suppressing the growth and activity in conditions like infectious
      diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. The
      nutritional profile of BGNM is high enough to sustain the growth of probiotics.
      BGNs are normally boiled and salted, eaten as a relish or roasted, and eaten as a
      snack. Hence, BGNM can also be fermented with lactic acid bacteria to make a
      probiotic beverage that not only increase the economic value of the nutritious
      legume but also help in addressing malnutrition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the symptom profile, course and prognosis of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) over a 15 years period. STUDY DESIGN: An
      observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shifa International Hospital,
      Islamabad, Pakistan, from 1996 to 2011. METHODOLOGY: Patients diagnosed with IBS 
      at the study centre were followed for their clinical features, course over the
      period of time, management and its results. Only those patients were included in 
      the study who completed the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 292 patients
      with mean age of 40.44 +/- 13.69 years were inducted. There were 156 (53.4%)
      males and 136 (46.6%) females. Nearly all male and female patients had abdominal 
      pain and bloating. However, constipation was seen in 79.4% females and 71.6
      males. Diarrhea was seen in 46.5% females and 42.7% males. Both constipation and 
      diarrhea were seen in 27.3% female and 15.6% males. A high number of patients had
      concomitant illnesses and a large proportion of them had sleep disturbances,
      exacerbations with stress and had food sensitivities. CONCLUSION: This
      longitudinal follow-up study showed that, in our setting, there were more males
      suffering from this illness; females had more constipation-dominant features.
      Prognosis over the course of illness was excellent in all patients.

AB  - Here, we define a psychobiotic as a live organism that, when ingested in adequate
      amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric
      illness. As a class of probiotic, these bacteria are capable of producing and
      delivering neuroactive substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin, 
      which act on the brain-gut axis. Preclinical evaluation in rodents suggests that 
      certain psychobiotics possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity. Effects may 
      be mediated via the vagus nerve, spinal cord, or neuroendocrine systems. So far, 
      psychobiotics have been most extensively studied in a liaison psychiatric setting
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, where positive benefits have been
      reported for a number of organisms including Bifidobacterium infantis. Evidence
      is emerging of benefits in alleviating symptoms of depression and in chronic
      fatigue syndrome. Such benefits may be related to the anti-inflammatory actions
      of certain psychobiotics and a capacity to reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      axis activity. Results from large scale placebo-controlled studies are awaited.

TI  - Fructose malabsorption syndrome.
PG  - 473-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328361c556 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fructose malabsorption is associated with gastrointestinal
      symptoms. This review examines new findings on the physiology, assessment and
      therapy of fructose malabsorption in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Additional GLUT transport mechanisms that regulate fructose
      absorption might be involved in symptom adaptation to high-fructose diets.
      Although glucose is known to facilitate fructose absorption, erythritol promotes 
      malabsorption. The methodologies of fructose breath testing and its clinical
      utility have been questioned by findings of unrealistic testing dose and poor
      reproducibility. Although fructose restriction appears to benefit children with
      functional abdominal pain, fructose restriction itself may not be the key player.
      In irritable bowel syndrome, fructose restriction within a diet low in other
      fermentable carbohydrates fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide
      monosaccharide and polyols produced good symptom control compared with habitual
      diet, but such therapy resulted in significantly reduced bifidobacteria. Fructose
      absorption and subsequently, abdominal pain and nausea are improved by a novel
      enzyme therapy that converts fructose to glucose for absorption. SUMMARY: New
      insights into factors affecting fructose absorption may have therapeutic
      applications. Doubts surrounding clinical utility of fructose breath testing are 
      emerging. Although restriction of fructose and other fermentable,
      oligosaccharide, disaccharide monosaccharide and polyols have efficacy for
      functional gastrointestinal symptoms, potentially negative effects on microbiota 
      deserve attention.

TI  - Decreased levels of kynurenic acid in the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients:
      relation to serotonin and psychological state.
PG  - 501-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2013.01.008 [doi]
LID - S0022-3999(13)00025-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with psychiatric
      comorbidity and alterations in serotonergic metabolism. Tryptophan is the
      precursor of serotonin (5-HT), but it is mainly catabolized through the
      kynurenine pathway. This pathway may also be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS 
      by virtue of deviating tryptophan from the 5-HT pathway resulting in 5-HT
      deficiency. We therefore aimed to ascertain the mucosal and systemic
      concentrations of 5-HT and kynurenic acid (KYNA), a principal kynurenine
      metabolite. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal biopsy specimens and platelet poor plasma
      samples were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers and 15 IBS patients.
      Psychological state was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      and the Symptom Checklist-90. RESULTS: IBS patients showed significantly lower
      mucosal and higher systemic concentrations of both 5-HT and KYNA compared to
      healthy controls. Also, significant correlation between mucosal but not plasma
      concentrations of KYNA and 5-HT and psychological state in IBS was observed.
      CONCLUSION: The observation that mucosal KYNA and 5-HT are both decreased in IBS 
      does not support the hypothesis that increased activation along the kynurenic
      pathway results in relative 5-HT deficiency. However, an increased release of
      these substances from the intestine to the systemic compartment may lead to a
      decrease in intestinal KYNA and 5-HT levels, resulting in disturbance of
      intestinal homeostasis. Thus, changes in psychological states observed in IBS
      patients may be secondary to alterations in gastrointestinal function, and in
      particular kynurenine and/or 5-HT metabolism.

TI  - Lactose malabsorption diagnosed by 50-g dose is inferior to assess clinical
      intolerance and to predict response to milk withdrawal than 25-g dose in an
      endemic area.
PG  - 1462-8
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12273 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), diagnosed currently using lactose
      hydrogen breath and tolerance tests (LHBT, LTT) with a high, nonphysiological
      dose (50-g), may mimic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In LM-endemic areas,
      clinically significant malabsorption (lactose intolerance) may be better
      diagnosed using a lesser dose, and positive results so obtained may predict
      response to milk withdrawal more effectively. METHODS: Fifty patients each with
      IBS (Rome III) were evaluated using LHBT and LTT with 50-g, 25-g, and 12-g
      lactose. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT and LTT with different dosages (gold
      standard: lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism) and symptom development were
      evaluated. Effect of milk withdrawal was studied. RESULT: Of 150 patients, 37/50 
      (74%) and 28/50 (56%) had LM by LHBT and LTT using 50-g lactose; 41/50 (82%) and 
      31/50 (62%) had LM using 25-g lactose, and 14/50 (28%) and 29/50 (58%) using 12-g
      lactose, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT using 50-g, 25-g, and 
      12-g lactose were 92.6%, 52.0%, and 94%, 60%, and 36.4%, 88.2%, and those of LTT,
      92%, 80.0%, and 84.8%, 82.4%, and 66.7%, 58.8%, respectively. Breath hydrogen
      correlated with lactose dose. Though patients developing symptoms with 50-g
      lactose exhaled more hydrogen than those remaining asymptomatic, hydrogen levels 
      did not differ following 25-g and 12-g dosages in relation to symptom
      development. Patients' milk intake was 335 +/- 92 mL/d ( approximately 16.7 +/-
      9.6-g lactose). Positive LHBT using 25-g dose better predicted symptom resolution
      than by 50-g and 12-g lactose. CONCLUSION: Twenty-five gram is the ideal dose of 
      lactose for LHBT and LTT in LM-endemic areas.

TI  - Mechanisms and effectiveness of prebiotics in modifying the gastrointestinal
      microbiota for the management of digestive disorders.
PG  - 288-98
LID - 10.1017/S0029665113001262 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with each human individual
      hosting at least 160 different bacterial strains. Our understanding of its role
      is rapidly expanding as a result of the molecular microbiological techniques that
      can accurately characterise its composition and 'omics' technologies that measure
      its metabolic activity. Since 1995, extensive research has investigated the
      prebiotic concept, which describes how supplementation of some non-digestible
      oligosaccharides can stimulate the growth and/or activity of specific genera
      including bifidobacteria. However, the vast majority of studies are in healthy
      human subjects, with few undertaken in patients with disorders relevant to
      clinical nutrition. Marked alterations of the luminal microbiota have been
      demonstrated in patients with digestive disorders, highlighting mechanisms
      through which they might be involved in their pathogenesis, including higher
      clostridia in patients who develop diarrhoea during enteral nutrition and the
      influence of bifidobacteria on intestinal dendritic cell phenotype in Crohn's
      disease. The impact of prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of healthy people 
      has not been consistently replicated in patients with digestive disorders. For
      example, a number of studies show that inulin/oligofructose do not increase
      bifidobacteria in enteral nutrition and Crohn's disease. Indeed, in Crohn's
      disease and irritable bowel syndrome there is evidence that some prebiotics in
      high doses worsen functional symptoms. Unlike healthy human subjects, patients
      experience a number of issues that may alter their gastrointestinal microbiota
      (disease, antibiotics and inflammation) and the use of microbiota modifying
      therapies, such as prebiotics, do not always elicit the same effects in patients 
      as they do in healthy people.

AB  - Trial design and endpoints for the evaluation of drug efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) underwent major changes over the last two decades. A systematic
      review in the early 1990s concluded that there were few well-designed and
      well-executed treatment trials in IBS. Over the next decade, the so-called binary
      endpoints were used in several clinical trials in IBS in the US, Europe and other
      parts of the world. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a
      general guidance for the evaluation of symptom benefit in clinical trials based
      on patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, which had a major impact on trial
      design in IBS. In May 2012, the FDA recommended to use as provisional endpoint
      the quantification of two major IBS aspects, abdominal pain and disordered
      defecation, to assess the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in IBS. In the
      present issue of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, the performance of the FDA
      Responder Endpoint for clinical trials in irritable bowel syndrome with
      constipation was evaluated using data from two large Phase III clinical trials of
      linaclotide. The FDA interim endpoints are clinically relevant as they are also
      able to capture the smallest patient-reported difference in the domain of
      Abdominal Pain intensity and Abnormal Defecation with good diagnostic accuracy.
      The FDA responder definition and the European Medicines Agency responder
      definitions generate similar response rates, while binary endpoints generate
      higher responder rates. The implications for optimalization and harmonisation are
      discussed.

AB  - Few models currently exist to realistically simulate the complex human
      intestine's micro-environment, where a variety of interactions take place. Proper
      homeostasis directly depends on these interactions, as they shape an entire
      immunological response inducing tolerance against food antigens while at the same
      time mounting effective immune responses against pathogenic microbes accidentally
      ingested with food. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved also through various
      complex interactions between the microbiota (including food-associated beneficial
      bacterial strains) and the host, that regulate the attachment/degradation of
      mucus, the production of antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial barrier, and
      the "education" of epithelial cells' that controls the tolerogenic or immunogenic
      phenotype of unique, gut-resident lymphoid cells' populations. These interactions
      have been so far very difficult to reproduce with in vitro assays using either
      cultured cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, mouse
      models differ substantially in components of the intestinal mucosa (mucus layer
      organization, commensal bacteria community) with respect to the human gut. Thus, 
      studies of a variety of treatments to be brought in the clinics for important
      stress-related or pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer have been difficult to carry out.
      To address these issues, we developed a novel system that enables us to stimulate
      explants of human intestinal mucosa that retain their in situ conditioning by the
      host microbiota and immune response, in a polarized fashion. Polarized apical
      stimulation is of great importance for the outcome of the elicited immune
      response. It has been repeatedly shown that the same stimuli can produce
      completely different responses when they bypass the apical face of the intestinal
      epithelium, stimulating epithelial cells basolaterally or coming into direct
      contact with lamina propria components, switching the phenotype from tolerogenic 
      to immunogenic and causing unnecessary and excessive inflammation in the area. We
      achieved polarized stimulation by gluing a cave cylinder which delimited the area
      of stimulation on the apical face of the mucosa as will be described in the
      protocol. We used this model to examine, among others, differential effects of
      three different Lactobacilli strains. We show that this model system is very
      powerful to assess the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics in healthy and
      disease conditions.

TI  - A dietary survey of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 36-47
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food is one of the most commonly reported triggers of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms. However, the role of diet in the aetiology and
      management of IBS has not been clearly established. The present study aimed to
      examine the dietary practices of Irish patients with IBS and to determine whether
      these practices increased their vulnerability to nutritional inadequacies.
      METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 135 IBS patients on their perceptions
      of the role of diet in their symptoms and whether they restrict their diet
      according to the symptoms experienced. A similar questionnaire was used to
      investigate the perceptions of 111 healthy subjects to the gastrointestinal
      symptoms experienced on the consumption of food. RESULTS: Food was considered to 
      cause or worsen their gastrointestinal symptoms in 89.6% of IBS patients compared
      to 55% of healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Cereal-based foods, predominantly bread
      or its components, were the most frequently cited (53.3%), and spicy foods
      (39.3%), vegetables and fatty foods (35.6% for both) also featured prominently. A
      significantly greater number of patients with IBS reported changing their diet to
      minimise symptoms compared to healthy controls (91.9% versus 45.5%, P < 0.001).
      In relation to whole food groups, milk products (9.6%), fruit (7.4%) and
      vegetables (5.2%) were those most commonly restricted, with only a small number
      of IBS patients seeking professional healthcare advice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority
      of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to food, and change their
      diet by limiting the foods that they perceive as problematic, with some
      restricting whole food groups. Few patients sought professional healthcare advice
      when implementing dietary change, possibly exposing a considerable number to an
      increased risk of nutritional deficiency.
