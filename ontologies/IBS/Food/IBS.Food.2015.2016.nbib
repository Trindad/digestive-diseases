AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, rheumatic disease
      characterized by widespread myofascial pain, of unknown aetiology, having a major
      impact on quality of life (QOL). Available pharmacotherapy for FM is marginally
      effective. FM is associated with co-morbidities of gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). There is growing evidence that
      diets low in FODMAPs, "fermentable oligo-, di- or mono-saccharides and polyols"
      [Low FODMAP Diet (LFD)], are effective in treating IBS. The aim of this pilot
      study was to examine the effects of LFDs on symptoms of FM, especially with
      regard to pain, QOL and GI disorders. METHODS: A longitudinal study using LFD
      intervention was performed on 38, 51+/-10 year-old, female patients diagnosed
      with FM for an average of 10 years, based on ACR (American College of
      Rheumatology) 2010 criteria. The study was conducted from January through May,
      2015, using a four-week, repeated-assessment model, as follows: Moment 0 -
      introduction of the protocol to participants; Moment 1 - first assessment and
      delivery of individual LFD dietary plans; Moment 2 - second assessment and
      reintroduction of FODMAPs; Moment 3 - last assessment and final nutritional
      counselling. Assessment tools used were the following: RFIQ (Revised Fibromyalgia
      Impact Questionnaire), FSQ (Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire), IBS-SSS (Severity
      Score System), EQ-5D (Euro-QOL quality of life instrument), and VAS (Visual
      Analogue Scale). Daily consumption of FODMAPs was quantified based on published
      food content analyses. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, non-parametric
      Friedman, t-student and Chi-square tests, using SPSS 22 software. RESULTS: The
      mean scores of the 38 participants at the beginning of the study were: FSQ
      (severity of FM, 0-31) - 22+/-4.4; RFIQ (0-100) - 65+/-17; IBS-SSS (0-500) -
      275+/-101; and EQ-5D (0-100) - 48+/-19. Mean adherence to dietary regimens was
      86%, confirmed by significant difference in FODMAP intakes (25g/day vs. 2.5g/day;
      p<0.01). Comparisons between the three moments of assessment showed significant
      (p<0.01) declines in scores in VAS, FSQ, and RFIQ scores, in all domains
      measured. An important improvement was observed with a reduction in the severity 
      of GI symptoms, with 50% reduction in IBS scores to 138+/-117, following LFD
      therapy. A significant correlation (r=0.36; p<0.05) was found between
      improvements in FM impact (declined scores) and gastrointestinal scores. There
      was also a significant correlation (r=0.65; p<0.01) between "satisfaction with
      improvement" after introduction of LFDs and "diet adherence", with satisfaction
      of the diet achieving 77% among participants. A significant difference was
      observed between patients who improved as compared to those that did not improve 
      (Chi-square chi(2)=6.16; p<.05), showing that the probability of improvement,
      depends on the severity of the RFIQ score. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of diet
      therapy involving FODMAP restrictions, in this cohort of FM patients, resulted in
      a significant reduction in GI disorders and FM symptoms, including pain scores.
      These results need to be extended in future larger studies on dietary therapy for
      treatment of FM. IMPLICATIONS: According to current scientific knowledge, these
      are the first relevant results found in an intervention with LFD therapy in FM
      and must be reproduced looking for a future dietetic approach in FM.

AB  - AIM: To determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: In this
      randomized triple-blind trial, adult IBS volunteers who were recruited according 
      to Rome III criteria received 10(9) or 10(10) colony-forming units of NCFM or
      placebo daily for 12 wk. IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), which constituted 
      the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes, including individual IBS symptoms,
      IBS-related QoL questionnaire, anxiety and depression, defecation frequency, and 
      stool consistency, were assessed at baseline at the end of the 8-wk run-in
      period, after 4 and 12 wk of intervention, and after a 4-wk washout. RESULTS: A
      total of 340 of 391 randomized volunteers completed the trial. IBS-SSS improved
      over 12 wk of treatment in all treatment groups, decreasing by a mean +/- SD of
      44.0 +/- 80.2, 50.8 +/- 82.4, and 48.3 +/- 72.2 in the placebo, active low-dose, 
      and active high-dose groups, respectively. Similarly, secondary outcomes did not 
      differ between treatment groups. However, in a post hoc analysis of volunteers
      with moderate to severe abdominal pain at baseline (VAS > 35/100), the treatment 
      significantly reduced the sensation of abdominal pain. Pain scores fell by 20.8
      +/- 22.8, 29.4 +/- 17.9, and 31.2 +/- 21.9 in the placebo, active low-dose, and
      active high-dose groups, respectively (P value for placebo vs combined active
      doses = 0.0460). CONCLUSION: NCFM alleviates moderate to severe abdominal pain,
      consistent with earlier observations of this strain mitigating visceral pain
      through increased analgesic receptor expression.

AB  - AIM: To estimate annual direct and indirect costs for patients diagnosed with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and subtypes. METHODS: Patients completed a
      standardized questionnaire concerning usage of healthcare resources, travel
      costs, meals, and productivity loss of patients when seeking treatment for IBS.
      Total annual costs per patient were calculated as the sum of direct (including
      medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs. Total annual costs per patient among 
      various IBS subtypes were compared. Analysis of variance and bootstrapped
      independent sample t-tests were performed to determine differences between groups
      after controlling for IBS subtypes. RESULTS: A total of 105 IBS patients (64.80% 
      female), mean age of 57.12 years +/- 10.31 years), mean disease duration of 4.31 
      years +/- 5.40 years, were included. Total annual costs per patient were
      estimated as CNY18262.84 (USD2933.08). Inpatient and outpatient healthcare use
      were major cost drivers, accounting for 46.41%and 23.36% of total annual costs,
      respectively. Productivity loss accounted for 25.32% of total annual costs. The
      proportions of direct and indirect costs were similar to published studies in
      other countries. Nationally, the total costs of managing IBS would amount to
      CNY123.83 billion (USD1.99 billion). Among the IBS subtypes, total annual costs
      per patient of IBS-M was highest at CNY18891.18 (USD3034). Furthermore, there was
      significant difference in productivity loss among IBS subtypes (P = 0.031).
      CONCLUSION: IBS imposes a huge economic burden on patients and healthcare
      systems, which could account for 3.3% of the total healthcare budget for the
      entire Chinese nation. More than two-thirds of total annual costs of IBS consist 
      of inpatient and outpatient healthcare use. Among the subtypes, IBS-M patients
      appear to have the greatest economic burden but require further confirmation.

PG  - 10093-10102
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i46.10093 [doi]
AB  - Children with autism are commonly affected by gastrointestinal problems such as
      abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhea. In recent years, there has been a
      growing interest in the use of probiotics in this population, as it
      hypothetically may help to improve bowel habits and the behavioral and social
      functioning of these individuals. The gut microbiome plays an important role in
      the pathophysiology of organic as well as functional gastrointestinal disorders. 
      Microbial modification with the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and fecal
      transplantation have been effective in the treatment of conditions such as
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, pouchitis, and irritable bowel
      syndrome. The present review presents a number of reported clinical,
      immunological and microbiome-related changes seen in children with autism
      compared to normally developed children. It also discusses gut inflammation,
      permeability concerns, and absorption abnormalities that may contribute to these 
      problems. Most importantly, it discusses evidence, from human and animal studies,
      of a potential role of probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms
      in children with autism.

      Visceral pain stimuli are perceived and transmitted by afferent neurons residing 
      in the dorsal root ganglia that have sensory nerve endings in the gut wall and
      mesentery. Accumulating evidence indicates that peripheral activation and
      sensitization of these sensory nerve endings by bioactive mediators released by
      activated immune cells, in particular mast cells, can lead to aberrant
      neuroimmune interactions and the development and maintenance of visceral
      hypersensitivity. Besides direct neuronal activation, low concentrations of
      proteases, histamine, and serotonin can chronically sensitize nociceptors, such
      as TRP channels, leading to persistent aberrant pain perception. PURPOSE: This
      review discusses the potential mechanisms underlying aberrant neuroimmune
      interactions in peripheral sensitization of sensory nerves. A better
      understanding of the cells, mediators, and molecular mechanisms triggering
      persistent aberrant neuroimmune interactions brings new insights into their
      contribution to the physiology and pathophysiology of visceral pain perception
      and provides novel opportunities for more efficient therapeutic treatments for
      these disorders.

TI  - A review of dose-responses of probiotics in human studies.
PG  - 143-151
LID - 10.3920/BM2016.0140 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic definition requires the administration of an 'adequate amount' in
      order to obtain a health benefit. What that amount should be is not indicated.
      Here, an overview is given of studies that investigated the dose-response
      relation of probiotics in human interventions. Studies were divided in;
      meta-analyses, meta-analyses on specific probiotic strains, and studies testing
      two or more doses of a probiotic (combination) in the same study. Meta-analyses
      on the effect of probiotics on antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) suggest a
      dose-response effect; for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea on the other
      hand no dose-response was observed. For other end-points; such as necrotising
      enterocolitis, prevention of atopic dermatitis and slow intestinal transit, no
      dose-response relation was identified in meta-analyses. For prophylaxis in
      colorectal cancer and relief of irritable bowel syndrome, no dose-response
      relation was determined. However, for blood pressure, a meta-analysis observed
      that higher doses (greater than 10(11) cfu) were more effective than lower doses.
      Meta-analyses of specific strains suggest a break-point for effectiveness of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children;
      no dose-response was observed for two other probiotics assessed. Studies
      comparing two or more doses indicate that faecal recovery and risk reduction of
      AAD follow a positive dose-response relationship. Other end-points such as immune
      markers, general health, and bowel function did not exhibit clear dose-response
      relations. For AAD, the findings are very compelling; both meta-analyses and
      dedicated dose-response studies observe a positive correlation between dose and
      AAD risk. These findings do not allow for extrapolation, but suggest that
      studying higher doses for this end-point would be worthwhile. The lack of a clear
      dose-response for other end-points, does not mean it does not exist; present data
      does just not allow drawing any conclusions.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

AB  - Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including
      the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin is a powerful
      antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly
      scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by
      increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate
      immune response through its direct and indirect actions. In addition, the
      dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations 
      in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes 
      expression. In the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are
      mediated by melatonin receptors (MT2), serotonin (5-HT), and cholecystokinin B
      (CCK2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. The levels of melatonin 
      in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10-100 times the blood concentrations.
      Also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the
      pineal gland. Gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food
      intake. Low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas 
      high doses may decrease gut motility. Melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant
      treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D),
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The purpose
      of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of
      melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially
      IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

AB  - Patients with anorexia nervosa often voice a multitude of symptoms in regards to 
      their gastrointestinal tract. These complaints can complicate the treatment of
      their eating disorder as they distract attention from the important goal of
      weight restoration. Moreover, the restricting of certain food groups also makes
      the task of weight restoration substantially more difficult, or may result in
      binging. Therefore a working knowledge of common gastrointestinal comorbidities, 
      such as celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      gastroparesis, is useful when treating a patient who has anorexia nervosa.

TI  - Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study 
      to Evaluate the Benefit of the Probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 in
      Non-Patients With Symptoms of Abdominal Discomfort and Bloating.
PG  - 145-151
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.511 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 is a probiotic that is used often in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Non-patients with bowel symptoms
      may differ from patients with IBS in the impact of their bowel symptoms on
      illness severity, healthcare and treatment seeking behavior. The aim of this
      study is to assess the efficacy of B. infantis 35624 (10(9) c.f.u. per day) for
      the relief of abdominal discomfort and bloating in a non-patient population.
      METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study with a
      2-week placebo run-in phase followed by a 4-week intervention phase was conducted
      at ten clinical centers (USA). Subjects were recruited from the general
      population by advertisement. The study randomized 302 subjects who experienced
      abdominal discomfort and bloating >/=2-times per week for at least three months
      but have not seen a physician or received prescribed medication for their
      symptoms in the past 12 months. Subjects were assessed for pre- to
      post-intervention changes in symptom severity (on a 6-point Likert scale; 0=none,
      5=very severe) and frequency (symptoms-free days). RESULTS: A total of 275
      subjects (mean age 42 years, 79% female, 74% Caucasian) provided evaluable data. 
      Overall mean severity scores at baseline were 2.4 for abdominal discomfort and
      2.5 for bloating with no significant differences between the placebo and
      probiotic groups. Both groups showed significant (P<0.05) improvement in
      abdominal discomfort and bloating scores over the 4-week intervention period.
      Mean severity symptom scores at the end of intervention showed no significant
      differences between the probiotic and the placebo groups in either abdominal
      discomfort or bloating (P>0.3). The frequency of abdominal bloating-free days was
      greater in the B. infantis 35624 group compared to the placebo group (P<0.05).
      Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous clinical studies 
      in patients with IBS, B. infantis 35624 did not show a significant improvement in
      the mean severity of symptoms of abdominal discomfort and bloating in a
      non-patient population. This may be explained by the high placebo effect and the 
      lower impact of functional bowel symptoms in the non-patient population.

TI  - Prevalence and Characterization of Self-Reported Gluten Sensitivity in The
      Netherlands.
LID - E714 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of individuals reports symptoms related to the
      ingestion of gluten-containing food in the absence of celiac disease. Yet the
      actual prevalence is not well established. METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 
      2016, unselected adults visiting marketplaces, dental practices and a university 
      in The Netherlands were asked to complete a modified validated questionnaire for 
      self-reported gluten sensitivity (srGS). RESULTS: Among the 785 adults enquired, 
      two had celiac disease. Forty-nine (6.2%) reported symptoms related to the
      ingestion of gluten-containing food. These individuals were younger,
      predominantly female and lived more frequently in urban regions compared with the
      other respondents. Symptoms reported included bloating (74%), abdominal
      discomfort (49%) and flatulence (47%). A total of 23 (47%) srGS individuals
      reported having had tried a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet. Abdominal
      discomfort related to fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide
      and polyol (FODMAP)-containing food was more often reported in srGS individuals
      compared with the other respondents (73.5% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:
      Self-reported GS is common in The Netherlands, especially in younger individuals,
      females and urban regions, although the prevalence was lower than in a comparable
      recent UK study. It cannot be excluded that FODMAPs are in part responsible for
      these symptoms.

AB  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FA)
      including food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food
      protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), and food protein-induced allergic
      proctocolitis (FPIAP) are relatively uncommon in infants and young children, but 
      are likely under-diagnosed. Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with
      majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of
      symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed
      for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to
      the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the
      role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is
      not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be 
      limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in
      infants.

AB  - Giardia intestinalis is a non-invasive protozoan parasite infecting the upper
      small intestine causing acute, watery diarrhea or giardiasis in 280 million
      people annually. Asymptomatic infections are equally common and recent data have 
      suggested that infections even can be protective against other diarrheal
      diseases. Most symptomatic infections resolve spontaneously but infections can
      lead to chronic disease and treatment failures are becoming more common
      world-wide. Giardia infections can also result in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
      and food allergies after resolution. Until recently not much was known about the 
      mechanism of giardiasis or the cause of post-giardiasis syndromes and treatment
      failures, but here we will describe the recent progress in these areas.

TI  - Pathophysiology of non-celiac gluten sensitivity: where are we now?
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.23736/S1121-421X.16.02346-1 [doi]
AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is the term used to describe individuals
      complaining of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to gluten
      ingestion and rapidly improving after its withdrawal, and in which both celiac
      disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) were properly ruled out. The prevalence of
      this condition remains unknown and a lot of questions about the possible
      pathogenetic mechanisms are still unclarified. It is believed that NCGS
      represents a heterogeneous condition with different subgroups potentially
      characterized by different pathogenesis, clinical history, and clinical course.
      Moreover, a possible overlap with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other
      functional diseases could complicate patient selection for clinical studies,
      slowing down the understanding of this disorder. Last but not least, the lack of 
      validated biomarkers remains a significant limitation in research studies on
      NCGS. Hence, there is a need for strict diagnostic criteria for NCGS.

TI  - Non-pharmacological management of abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders in children.
PG  - 389-398
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (AP-FGID)
      comprises of 4 main conditions: functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome,
      abdominal migraine and functional abdominal pain. AP-FGIDs are diagnosed
      clinically based on the Rome IV criteria for FGIDs of childhood. There is limited
      evidence for pharmacological therapies. DATA SOURCES: This review article
      discusses nonpharmacological management of AP-FGID based on the current
      literature including systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort and
      case control studies. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview on the available
      evidence for the pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists involved in
      managing children with AP-FGID. RESULTS: Managing AP-FGIDs can be challenging.
      This should follow a stepwise approach with focused history, identification of
      "red flag" signs and symptoms, physical examination and investigations done
      following initial consultation. Family needs explaining that there is nothing
      seriously wrong with the child's abdomen. This explanation and reassurance can
      achieve symptom control in large number of cases. Non-pharmacological
      interventions are delivered through lifestyle and dietary changes and
      bio-psychosocial therapies. Dietary interventions vary depending on the type of
      AP-FGID. Bio-psychosocial therapies such as hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral
      therapy and yoga aim at stress reduction. CONCLUSION: There is increasing
      evidence for use of non-pharmacological interventions in children with APFGID.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the composition of the resident bacteria within
      the gastrointestinal tract can influence the brain and behavior, particularly
      with respect to cognitive function. Cognitive function encompasses the life-long 
      process of learning, both long- and short-term processes. Cognition was
      originally thought to be exclusively regulated by the central nervous system,
      with long-term potentiation and neurogenesis contributing to the creation and
      storage of memories, but now other systems, including, for example, the immune
      system and the intestinal microbiome may also be involved. Cognitive impairment
      has been identified in numerous disease states, both gastrointestinal and
      extraintestinal in nature, many of which have also been characterized as having a
      role for dysbiosis in disease pathogenesis. This includes, but is not limited to,
      inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, type 1 diabetes, obesity, 
      major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. The role of cognition
      and the microbiome will be discussed in this chapter for all these diseases, as
      well as evidence for a role in maintaining overall human health and well being.
      Finally, evidence for a role for probiotics in beneficially modulating the
      microbiota and leading to improved cognition will be discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an important health problem
      that presents serious social burdens and high costs. Our study investigated the
      efficacy of synbiotic (Bifidobacterium lactis B94 with inulin), probiotic (B.
      lactis B94), and prebiotic (inulin) treatment for IBS in a pediatric age group.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was randomized, double-blind, controlled, and
      prospective in design and included 71 children between the ages of 4 and 16 years
      who were diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome III criteria. The first group
      received synbiotic treatment [5x109 colony forming units (CFU) of B. lactis B94
      and 900 mg inulin]; the second group received probiotic treatment (5x109 CFU B.
      lactis B94), and the third group received prebiotic treatment (900 mg inulin)
      twice daily for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment improved belching-abdominal
      fullness (p<0.001), bloating after meals (p=0.016), and constipation (p=0.031),
      and synbiotic treatment improved belching-abdominal fullness (p=<0.001), bloating
      after meals (p=0.004), constipation (p=0.021), and mucus in the feces (p=0.021). 
      The synbiotic group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with full
      recovery than the prebiotic group (39.1% vs. 12.5%, p=0.036). CONCLUSION:
      Administration of synbiotics and probiotics resulted in significant improvements 
      in initial complaints when compared to prebiotics. Additionally, there was a
      significantly higher number of patients with full recovery from IBS symptoms in
      the synbiotic group than in the prebiotic group. Therefore, the twice daily
      administration of synbiotics is suggested for the treatment of children with IBS.

TI  - Probiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products for functional and inflammatory
      bowel disorders.
PG  - 1426-1449
LID - 10.1111/bph.13632 [doi]
AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are
      very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on
      patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. 
      A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several
      therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional
      pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre
      and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both 
      groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several
      drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics,
      in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily
      peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and
      fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may
      be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative
      colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as
      mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to
      the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the
      low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate
      the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further,
      well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic
      options in the management of both FBD and IBD. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is

TI  - Refractory Depression, Fatigue, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and Chronic Pain: A
      Functional Medicine Case Report.
PG  - 15-242
LID - 10.7812/TPP/15-242 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Single-disorder or single-organ-system clinical practice guidelines
      are often of limited usefulness in guiding effective management of patients with 
      chronic multidimensional signs and symptoms. The presence of multiple
      long-standing medical problems in a given patient despite intensive medical
      effort suggests that addressing systemic core imbalances could complement more
      narrowly focused approaches. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man experiencing
      longstanding depression, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic pain in
      the context of additional refractory illnesses was assessed and treated, guided
      by a system-oriented approach to underlying core imbalances termed functional
      medicine. This patient was referred from a team of clinicians representing
      primary care, cardiology, gastroenterology, hematology, and psychology. Prior
      treatment had been unsuccessful in managing multiple chronic comorbidities.
      Diagnostic assessment included comprehensive stool and nutritional/metabolic
      laboratory testing. RESULTS: The blood-, urine-, or stool-based measurements of
      relevant markers for multiple systemic issues, including digestion/absorption,
      inflammation, oxidative stress, and methylation, identified previously
      unrecognized root causes of his constellation of symptoms. These functional
      measurements guided rational recommendations for dietary choices and
      supplementation. The patient experienced steady and significant improvement in
      his mental health, fatigue, chronic pain, and irritable bowel syndrome-as well as
      the unexpected resolution of his chronic idiopathic pancytopenia. CONCLUSION: The
      success in this case suggests that other patients with chronic, complex, and
      treatment-refractory illness may benefit from a system-oriented assessment of
      core imbalances guided by specialized nutritional/metabolic and digestive
      laboratory testing.

TI  - Effects of varying dietary content of fermentable short-chain carbohydrates on
      symptoms, fecal microenvironment, and cytokine profiles in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) is increasingly recommended for patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to investigate the effects of a
      blinded low-FODMAP vs high-fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) diet on symptoms, immune
      activation, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
      METHODS: Twenty patients with diarrhea-predominant or mixed IBS were instructed
      to follow a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) throughout a 9-week study period. After 3
      weeks, they were randomized and double-blindly assigned to receive a supplement
      of either FOS (FODMAP) or maltodextrin (placebo) for the next 10 days, followed
      by a 3-week washout period before crossover. Irritable bowel syndrome severity
      scoring system (IBS-SSS) was used to evaluate symptoms. Cytokines (interleukin
      [IL]-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were analyzed in blood samples,
      and gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA) and SCFAs were analyzed in fecal
      samples. KEY RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms consistently improved
      after 3 weeks of LFD, and significantly more participants reported symptom relief
      in response to placebo (80%) than FOS (30%). Serum levels of proinflammatory IL-6
      and IL-8, as well as levels of fecal bacteria (Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium,
      and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), total SCFAs, and n-butyric acid, decreased
      significantly on the LFD as compared to baseline. Ten days of FOS supplementation
      increased the level of these bacteria, whereas levels of cytokines and SCFAs
      remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Our findings support the efficacy
      of a LFD in alleviating IBS symptoms, and show changes in inflammatory cytokines,
      microbiota profile, and SCFAs, which may have consequences for gut health.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Poorly digested, fermentable carbohydrates may induce symptoms
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) via unclear mechanisms. We performed a
      randomized trial with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis to investigate
      correlations between symptoms and changes in small- and large-bowel contents
      after oral challenge. METHODS: We performed a 3-period, cross-over study of 29
      adult patients with IBS (based on Rome III criteria, with symptoms of abdominal
      pain or discomfort for at least 2 days/wk) and reported bloating. In parallel, we
      performed the same study of 29 healthy individuals (controls). Studies were
      performed in the United Kingdom from January 2013 through February 2015. On 3
      separate occasions (at least 7 days apart), subjects were given a 500-mL drink
      containing 40 g of carbohydrate (glucose in the first period, fructose in the
      second, and inulin in the third, in a random order). Levels of breath hydrogen
      were measured and intestinal content was assessed by MRI before and at various
      time points after consumption of each drink. Symptoms were determined based on
      subjects' responses to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire
      and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15. The primary end point was whether
      participants had a clinically important symptom response during the 300 minutes
      after consumption of the drink. RESULTS: More patients with IBS reached the
      predefined symptom threshold after intake of inulin (13 of 29) or fructose (11 of
      29) than glucose (6 of 29). Symptoms peaked sooner after intake of fructose than 
      inulin. Fructose increased small-bowel water content in both patients and
      controls whereas inulin increased colonic volume and gas in both. Fructose and
      inulin increased breath hydrogen levels in both groups, compared with glucose;
      fructose produced an earlier increase than inulin. Controls had lower symptom
      scores during the period after drink consumption than patients with IBS, despite 
      similar MRI parameters and breath hydrogen responses. In patients who reached the
      symptom threshold after inulin intake, peak symptom intensity correlated with
      peak colonic gas (r = 0.57; P < .05). Changes in MRI features and peak breath
      hydrogen levels were similar in patients who did and did not reach the symptom
      threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS and healthy individuals without IBS
      (controls) have similar physiological responses after intake of fructose or
      inulin; patients reported symptoms more frequently after inulin than controls. In
      patients with a response to inulin, symptoms related to levels of intraluminal
      gas, but peak gas levels did not differ significantly between responders,
      nonresponders, or controls. This indicates that colonic hypersensitivity to
      distension, rather than excessive gas production, produces carbohydrate-related
      symptoms in patients with IBS. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01776853.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the patient-reported multidimensional gastrointestinal
      symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in
      pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). METHODS:
      The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales
      and PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 259
      pediatric patients with functional constipation, functional abdominal pain (FAP),
      or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring
      stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble
      swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating,
      constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were identified as clinically important
      symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, and
      subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with
      overall HRQOL. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms were differentially associated 
      with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses for the three FGIDs. In predictive
      models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for age,
      gender, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms differentially accounted
      for an additional 47, 40, and 60 % of the variance in patient-reported HRQOL for 
      functional constipation, FAP, and IBS, respectively, reflecting large effect
      sizes. Significant individual gastrointestinal symptoms predictors were
      identified after controlling for the other gastrointestinal symptoms in the
      FGID-specific predictive models. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms represent
      potentially modifiable predictors of generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with
      FGIDs. Identifying the condition-specific gastrointestinal symptoms that are the 
      most important predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a
      patient-centered approach to targeted interventions designed to ameliorate
      impaired overall HRQOL.

PG  - S188-S190
AB  - Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria capable of colonizing the colonic
      mucosa. The most common probiotics include strains of Lactobacillus or
      Bifidobacteria, which are part of the normal gastrointestinal microbiota. Initial
      studies of selected probiotic species have suggested potential efficacy in
      several gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases
      (particularly pouchitis), antibiotic-related diarrhea, Clostridium difficile
      toxin-induced colitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and
      allergy. The so-called "gut-liver axis" involves complex interaction between the 
      liver parenchyma and gut microbiota. There is growing evidence to suggest that
      alteration in gut microbial components may affect the liver and can be a
      precipitating cofactor in development and modulating of chronic liver damage
      through ethanol, production of ammonia and endotoxin. This may allow for a better
      understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of verities of liver diseases and
      help to identify a microbial target for prevention and treatment of such
      diseases. This paper discusses the growing evidence that highlights the
      relationship between gut microbiota and development, prevention and treatment of 
      numbers of liver diseases.

TI  - Probiotics and Diverticular Disease: Evidence-based?
PG  - S159-S160
AB  - Diverticular disease (DD) is a common gastrointestinal condition. Clinical
      spectrum ranges from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated or 
      complicated DD. Symptoms related to uncomplicated DD are not specific and may be 
      indistinguishable from those of irritable bowel syndrome. Low-grade inflammation,
      altered intestinal microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal colonic
      motility have been identified as factors potentially contributing to symptoms.
      Probiotics may modify the gut microbial balance leading to health benefits.
      Probiotics, due to their anti-inflammatory effects and ability to maintain an
      adequate bacterial colonization in the colon, are promising treatment options for
      DD. This review focuses on the available evidence on the efficacy of prebiotics
      in uncomplicated DD.

TI  - Oral probiotic treatment of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35((R)) prevents visceral 
      hypersensitivity to a colonic inflammation and an acute psychological stress.
PG  - 188-200
LID - 10.1111/jam.13320 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the efficacy of a repeated oral treatment with two
      active pharmaceutical ingredients (Lcr Lenio((R)) and Lcr Restituo((R)) )
      derivated from the probiotic bacterial strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35((R)) 
      in two animal models mimicking different features of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). IBS is characterized by visceral pain associated with alteration of bowel 
      transit. IBS patients present visceral hypersensitivity with peripheral and
      central origins. METHODS AND RESULTS: The injection of
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) into the proximal colon as well as an
      acute partial restraint stress (PRS) produces colonic hypersensitivity measured
      in conscious rats by a decrease in pain threshold in response to distal colonic
      distension. Visceral hypersensitivity was produced by injection of TNBS 7 days
      before colonic distension or by acute PRS on testing day. Treatments were
      performed once a day during eight consecutive days. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      indicates that an 8-day probiotic treatment (Lcr Lenio and Lcr Restituo) produces
      an antihypersensitivity activity in both TNBS and PRS visceral pain models. As
      this probiotic strain attenuates peripherally and centrally induced visceral
      hypersensitivity in rats, it may be active in treatment of IBS symptoms. An
      immunomodulatory effect of the probiotics was highlighted in the TNBS model on
      the IL-23 secretion, suggesting a mechanism of action involving a regulation of
      the local IL-23/Th17 immune activation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Two
      formulas of Lcr35((R)) probiotic strain show very encouraging results for the
      treatment of IBS patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the
      role and mechanisms of probiotics on the pathogenesis of IBS.

TI  - Acute exacerbation of irritable bowel syndrome prevented by prn oral triptan.
PG  - 375-378
AB  - We report a case of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diarrhea subtype,
      characterized by daily 'morning rush' and episodic acute exacerbations brought on
      by common IBS trigger foods including insoluble fiber, red wine and large/rich
      meals. The patient also had a history of migraine headaches, and a family history
      suggesting a common diathesis for both disorders. Given hypothesized
      contributions to IBS from dysregulation of the enteric serotonergic system, a
      trial of low-dose triptan medication was implemented in the context of the
      patient's known IBS triggers, with highly satisfactory results.

TI  - Long-term response to gluten-free diet as evidence for non-celiac wheat
      sensitivity in one third of patients with diarrhea-dominant and mixed-type
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 29-39
LID - 10.1007/s00384-016-2663-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common but therapies are
      unsatisfactory. Food is often suspected as cause by patients, but diagnostic
      procedures, apart from allergy testing, are limited. Based on the hypothesis of
      non-celiac wheat sensitivity (WS) in a subgroup of IBS patients, we tested the
      long-term response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and investigated HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8
      expression as a diagnostic marker for WS in diarrhea-dominant (IBS-D) and
      mixed-type IBS (IBS-M). METHODS: The response to a GFD served as reference test
      for WS and HLA-DQ2/8 expression was determined as index test. Patients were
      classified as responders if they reported complete or considerable relief of IBS 
      symptoms on at least 75 % of weeks over a 4-month period of gluten-free diet.
      Established questionnaires (IBS-Quality of Life (IBS-QoL), IBS Symptom Severity
      Scale (IBS-SSS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)) were used for
      secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients finished the study. Of 
      these, 12 (34 %) were responders and classified as having WS (95 % CI 21-51 %).
      HLA-DQ2/8 expression had a specificity of 52 % (95 % CI 33-71 %) and sensitivity 
      of 25 % (95 % CI 8-54 %) for WS. Responders showed improvement in quality of life
      and symptom scores. At 1-year follow-up, all responders and 55 % of
      non-responders were still on GFD and reported symptom relief. CONCLUSION: Using
      strict criteria as recommended for IBS studies, about one third of patients with 
      IBS-D or IBS-M are wheat sensitive, with a similar proportion in both IBS types. 
      Expression of HLA-DQ2/8 is not useful as diagnostic marker for WS. Long-term
      adherence to a GFD is high and can sustain symptomatic improvement.

TI  - Effects of baseline abdominal pain and bloating on response to lubiprostone in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 1114-1122
LID - 10.1111/apt.13807 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lubiprostone (8 mug b.d.) received US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) approval in 2008 for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS-C) in women aged >/=18 years. In 2012, the FDA issued new
      guidance for IBS-C clinical trials, recommending a composite endpoint
      incorporating both abdominal pain and stool frequency. AIM: In a post hoc
      analysis, similar criteria were applied to data from two pivotal, phase 3,
      double-blind, randomised trials of lubiprostone in patients with IBS-C. METHODS: 
      Included patients had a baseline spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency
      <3/week and abdominal pain or bloating ratings >/=1.36 on a 5-point scale [0
      (absent) to 4 (very severe)]. Responders (composite endpoint) had a mean pain
      reduction >/=30% compared with baseline, and an increase from baseline of >/=1
      SBM/week for >/=6 of the 12 treatment weeks. Lubiprostone effects on abdominal
      pain alone were also evaluated, as were bloating alone and in a composite
      endpoint with stool frequency. RESULTS: In pooled data, 325 patients received
      lubiprostone and 180 received placebo. Rates of response were higher with
      lubiprostone vs. placebo for the composite endpoint of improved pain and stool
      frequency (26.3% vs. 15.3%, respectively; P = 0.008) and the composite endpoint
      of improved bloating and stool frequency (23.8% vs. 12.6%, respectively; P =
      0.012). Response rates were also higher with lubiprostone vs. placebo for
      abdominal pain alone (P = 0.005) and bloating alone (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION:
      Lubiprostone was significantly more effective than placebo in improving abdominal
      pain or bloating, and also in composite endpoints that included stool frequency.

TI  - Restriction of FODMAP in the management of bloating in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 476-84
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2016152 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder. Up to 96%
      of IBS patients experience bloating, resulting in poor response to conventional
      therapies and high consultation rates. Many IBS patients report that food
      triggers symptoms, particularly diets with poorly absorbed, short-chain
      carbohydrates, and restrict intake of certain foods to control their symptoms.
      IBS patients are especially susceptible to an attack due to visceral
      hypersensitivity. An emerging therapeutic strategy excludes fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) from the
      diet. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in improving
      symptoms of bloating in IBS patients. Individualised, structured dietary guidance
      may benefit those with persistent troublesome symptoms despite traditional
      therapies. In view of the multifactorial aetiology of the condition, it is
      probably best to use a multipronged approach, involving combination therapies, to
      address bloating in IBS patients.

TI  - Review on Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4: Functionality and Nutraceutical
      Applications as a Probiotic Microorganism.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17091544 [doi]
LID - E1544 [pii]
AB  - Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 is a probiotic strain that has been used as a major 
      ingredient to produce nutraceutical products and as a dairy starter since 2000.
      The various bio-functional effects and potential for industrial application of B.
      bifidum BGN4 has been characterized and proven by in vitro (i.e., phytochemical
      bio-catalysis, cell adhesion and anti-carcinogenic effects on cell lines, and
      immunomodulatory effects on immune cells), in vivo (i.e., suppressed allergic
      responses in mouse model and anti-inflammatory bowel disease), and clinical
      studies (eczema in infants and adults with irritable bowel syndrome). Recently,
      the investigation of the genome sequencing was finished and this data potentially
      clarifies the biochemical characteristics of B. bifidum BGN4 that possibly
      illustrate its nutraceutical functionality. However, further systematic research 
      should be continued to gain insight for academic and industrial applications so
      that the use of B. bifidum BGN4 could be expanded to result in greater benefit.
      This review deals with multiple studies on B. bifidum BGN4 to offer a greater
      understanding as a probiotic microorganism available in functional food
      ingredients. In particular, this work considers the potential for commercial
      application, physiological characterization and exploitation of B. bifidum BGN4
      as a whole.

TI  - Modulation of microbiota as treatment for intestinal inflammatory disorders: An
      uptodate.
PG  - 7186-202
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7186 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the
      pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is
      emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing
      benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics,
      synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize
      recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory
      disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora,
      probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles
      published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled
      trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A
      meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies.
      Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy
      in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available
      for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of 
      rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable
      bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized 
      as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.
      Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, 
      although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be 
      encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.

TI  - The feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of traditional paper food and
      symptom journals for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paper food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journals are used to
      help irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients determine potential trigger foods.
      The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and
      clinical utility of such journals as a data collection tool. A secondary aim was 
      to explore a method for analyzing journal data to describe patterns of diet and
      symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=17) were asked to log three sets of 3-day food
      and symptom journals over a 15-day period. Feasibility was evaluated by journal
      completion rates, symptom logging compliance, and logging fatigability. The
      feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of journaling were also assessed by 
      a customized evaluation and exit interview. For each journal, regression analyses
      were conducted to examine relationships between key meal nutrients and subsequent
      symptoms. KEY RESULTS: Most participants were young (mean age 35+/-12) Caucasian 
      (N=13) women (N=14). Journal completion rates were 100% for all participants with
      no logging fatigability. Over half perceived paper journaling of food and
      symptoms as feasible, usable, and clinically useful. Thirteen participants
      demonstrated a strong association with at least one symptom and meal nutrient.
      Patterns of associations differed among participants. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES:
      Paper journaling of food and GI symptoms for 9 days over a 15-day period appeared
      to be a feasible and usable data collection tool for IBS patients. Over half
      perceived journaling as at least somewhat clinically useful. Findings from this
      study support the anecdote that food trigger(s) and associated symptom(s) vary
      for each individual.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) has been found to significantly reduce symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet is best implemented in two phases: initial strict 
      elimination of foods high in FODMAPs, then gradual reintroduction based on
      symptoms. Further study of this diet's effect on intestinal microbiota is needed.

AB  - Diet is considered an important triggering factor for gastrointestinal symptoms
      whose physiopathology includes not only measurable, inflammatory reactions, but
      also functional disorders, where no organic effects may be measured or
      demonstrated. Moreover, the prevalence of the perceived intolerance to certain
      foods ranges from 20-25% (within the general population) to 50-70% in diseases
      like irritable bowel syndrome. This intolerance has been observed particularly
      after the consumption of milk and dairy products, which are frequently considered
      as causative of gastrointestinal symptoms, thus limiting their ingestion.
      However, this behavior reduces the dietary sources of calcium and consequently
      may lead to malnutrition and bone decalcification, amongst other complications.
      The true dairy intolerance (intestinal lactase deficiency) explains most of the
      symptoms ensuing their consumption, but the frequency of such alteration on the
      different gastrointestinal diseases has not been determined. This review focuses 
      on the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases and the existing evidence
      regarding the alterations and symptoms related to the consumption of milk or
      dairy products.

TI  - Adding glucose to food and solutions to enhance fructose absorption is not
      effective in preventing fructose-induced functional gastrointestinal symptoms:
      randomised controlled trials in patients with fructose malabsorption.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, the absorption of fructose in excess of
      glucose in solution is enhanced by the addition of glucose. The present study
      aimed to assess the effects of glucose addition to fructose or fructans on
      absorption patterns and genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with
      functional bowel disorders. METHODS: Randomised, blinded, cross-over studies were
      performed in healthy subjects and functional bowel disorder patients with
      fructose malabsorption. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) was determined for breath 
      hydrogen and symptom responses to: (i) six sugar solutions (fructose in solution)
      (glucose; sucrose; fructose; fructose + glucose; fructan; fructan + glucose) and 
      (ii) whole foods (fructose in foods) containing fructose in excess of glucose
      given with and without additional glucose. Intake of fermentable short chain
      carbohydrates (FODMAPs; fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols)
      was controlled. RESULTS: For the fructose in solution study, in 26 patients with 
      functional bowel disorders, breath hydrogen was reduced after glucose was added
      to fructose compared to fructose alone [mean (SD) AUC 92 (107) versus 859 (980)
      ppm 4 h(-1) , respectively; P = 0.034). Glucose had no effect on breath hydrogen 
      response to fructans (P = 1.000). The six healthy controls showed breath hydrogen
      patterns similar to those with functional bowel disorders. No differences in
      symptoms were experienced with the addition of glucose, except more nausea when
      glucose was added to fructose (P = 0.049). In the fructose in foods study,
      glucose addition to whole foods containing fructose in excess of glucose in nine 
      patients with functional bowel disorders and nine healthy controls had no
      significant effect on breath hydrogen production or symptom response.
      CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a favourable response on symptoms does not support
      the concomitant intake of glucose with foods high in either fructose or fructans 
      in patients with functional bowel disorders.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract characterised by multi-factorial aetiology. In IBS physiopathology are
      involved diverse factors between them biological, psychosocial, and environmental
      components which affect the immune activation status of gut mucosa. Among these
      factors is recognized the intestinal parasitosis. Post-infection IBS (PI-IBS) is 
      recognised as a subgroup of functional disorders whose symptoms onset appear
      after a symptomatic intestinal infection caused by microbial agents. There are
      few studies regarding of relationship between IBS and intestinal parasitosis in
      Chile. However, is has been well described a positive association between IBS and
      Blastocystis hominis infections, one of prevalent parasites in Chile. In other
      countries, is also described a relationship between IBS and amebiasis and
      giardiasis. Both, characterized by a common mode of transmission through water as
      well as contaminated food. Because the high prevalence of parasitosis in our
      country it is necessary to expand the association studies to clarify the strength
      of the parasites ethiology in IBS.

AB  - Background and Aim. The efficacy of supplementation treatment with two
      multispecies probiotic formulates on subjects diagnosed with IBS-C and the
      assessment of their gut microbiota were investigated. Methods. A randomized,
      double-blind, three-arm parallel group trial was carried out on 150 IBS-C
      subjects divided into three groups (F_1, F_2, and F_3). Each group received a
      daily oral administration of probiotic mixtures (for 60 days) F_1 or F_2 or
      placebo F_3, respectively. Fecal microbiological analyses were performed by
      species-specific qPCR to assess the different amount of probiotics. Results. The 
      percentage of responders for each symptom was higher in the probiotic groups when
      compared to placebo group during the treatment period (t60) and was maintained
      quite similar during the follow-up period (t90). Fecal analysis demonstrated that
      probiotics of the formulations increased during the times of treatment only in
      fecal DNA from subjects treated with F_1 and F_2 and not with F_3, and the same
      level was maintained during the follow-up period. Conclusions. Multispecies
      probiotic supplementations are effective in IBS-C subjects and induce a different
      assessment in the composition of intestinal microbiota. This clinical study is
      registered with the clinical study registration number ISRCTN15032219.

AB  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten challenge has been proposed to confirm
      a diagnosis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in patients without celiac
      disease who respond to a gluten-free diet. To determine the accuracy of this
      approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      gluten-challenge trials, comprising 1312 adults. The studies varied in the
      duration of the challenge (range, 1 d to 6 wk), daily doses for the gluten
      challenge (range, 2-52 g; 3 studies administered <8 g/d), and composition of the 
      placebo (gluten-free products, xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch
      containing fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found gluten challenge
      to significantly increase symptom scores compared with placebo. However, only 38 
      of 231 NCGS patients (16%) showed gluten-specific symptoms. Furthermore, 40% of
      these subjects had a nocebo response (similar or increased symptoms in response
      to placebo). These findings reveal heterogeneity and potential methodology flaws 
      among studies of gluten challenge, cast doubt on gluten as the culprit food
      component in most patients with presumptive NCGS, and highlight the importance of
      the nocebo effect in these types of studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The substantial characteristics of Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      (IBS) are associated with estrogens in women. Both soy isoflavones and vitamin D 
      can modulate estrogen receptors in the colonic smooth muscles. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones, vitamin D and their
      probable interactions in women with IBS. METHODS: In a factorial blinded
      randomized clinical trial, 100 women with IBS (age:18-75yr, were randomly
      assigned in 4 arms to receive either placebo of vitamin D and placebo of soy
      isoflavones (P+P), or placebo of vitamin D and soy isoflavones (P+S), or vitamin 
      D and placebo of soy isoflavones (D+P), or vitamin D and soy isoflavones (D+S)
      for 6 weeks. Dosage of soy isoflavone was 2 capsules of 20 mg soy isoflavones per
      day, and dosage of vitamin D was one pearl of 50'000 IU biweekly. The clinical
      outcomes were IBS symptoms severity scores (IBS-SSS), disease- specific quality
      of life (IBS-QOL) and total score (IBS-TS) that evaluated at weeks 0, 6, and 10, 
      and compared to each other. RESULTS: IBS-TS improved significantly in both S+P
      and D+P groups (p- value = 0.004, 0.015). The interaction effect of soy
      isoflavones and vitamin D on IBS-TS was significant (p<0.05). The interaction
      effect of soy isoflavones with vitamin D and the main effect of vitamin D on
      IBS-SSS were not statistically significant, whereas IBS-SSS decreased
      significantly in S+P and D+P groups (p-value = 0.001, 0.047 respectively).
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that co-administration of soy isoflavones with
      vitamin D did not improve the IBS- SSS and IBS- QOL; however, it improved the
      IBS-TS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT02026518.

AB  - The concept of irritated bowel syndrome as a complex of functional disorders that
      can not be explained by organic changes and are totally due to intestinal
      motility and visceral sensitivity needs revision. The development of this
      syndrome also depends on a number of pathogenetic and etiological factors, such
      as inflammation of intestinal mucosa, changes of its permeability, previous
      infection, altered microflora, gene polymorphism, and food hypersensitivity.

      comparative controlled study].
PG  - 84-91
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal
      disorder associated with decrease in quality of life and a high social cost. Diet
      is one of several therapeutic options in IBS treatment; therefore the development
      and clinical evaluation of innovative functional food for IBS patients are
      actual. Instant drink containing 4 g inulin, 4 mg menthol and 2 mg of pyridoxine 
      (in daily dose) has been evaluated. 49 patients 18-68 (41.5+/-16.5) years old
      fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS-C were randomly assigned into two
      groups: one received standard diet plus two drinks per day for 2 weeks and
      control group received standard diet. Response to therapy was recorded daily
      using Likert scale of abdominal pain, bloating and feeling of incomplete bowel
      emptying, frequency of bowel movement, Bristol stool scale, and quality of life
      was assessed by IBSQoL questionnaire before and after the treatment. The
      consumption of the drink with inulin and menthol contributed to a significant
      positive effect on the stool parameters (from 0.91+/-0.73 to 1.12+/-0.45 bowel
      movements per day in stool frequency, p=0.05, from 2.68+/-1.63 to 3.43+/-1.27
      index Bristol scale, p=0.05), reduced the severity of abdominal pain (from
      1.78+/-0.58 to 1.47?0.61 Likert scale points, p=0.05), bloating (from 2.22+/-0.83
      to 1.53+/-0.71 points ofLikertscale,p= 0.01) and a sense of incomplete
      bowelemptying (from 2.22 +/- 0.88 to 1.61+/- 0.81 points of Likert scale,
      p=0.001), as well as increased the quality of life (from 75.3+/- 12.0 to
      83.3+/-6.7%, p=0.05), but a significant part of patients (10 of 25) complained
      the appearance of heartburn after the start of the treatment. In conclusion, the 
      consumption of the functional drink containing inulin, menthol and pyridoxine is 
      associated with improve in stool parameters, abdominal pain, Bristol scale index 
      and increase in quality of life in patients with IBS-C, but produce noticeable
      heartburn. Changes in functional drink composition are needed to reduce adverse
      effects.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: low-FODMAP rye bread vs. regular rye bread to relieve 
      the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 460-70
LID - 10.1111/apt.13726 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Grains are high in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides 
      And Polyols) and often considered as triggers of IBS symptoms. AIM: To evaluate
      if rye bread low in FODMAPs would be better tolerated than regular rye bread in
      subjects with IBS. METHODS: The study was conducted as a randomised double blind 
      controlled cross-over study (n = 87). Participants were supplied with both
      regular rye bread and low-FODMAP rye bread for 4 weeks. Symptoms were measured
      with a symptom severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) 
      assessments of individual symptoms. Quality of life was monitored. Colonic
      fermentation was measured by the breath hydrogen test and dietary intake by food 
      diaries. RESULTS: Dietary fibre intake increased during both study periods
      compared to baseline. Many signs of IBS i.e. flatulence, abdominal pain, cramps
      and stomach rumbling were milder on the low-FODMAP rye bread (P-values: 0.04;
      0.049; 0.01 and 0.001). The mean of VAS measurements was favourable towards LF
      bread [-3 (95% CI): -6 to -1, P = 0.02] but no differences were detected in
      IBS-SSS or quality of life. The AUC of breath hydrogen values was significantly
      lower during the low-FODMAP bread period (median 52.9 vs. 72.6; P = 0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-FODMAP rye bread helps IBS patients to control their symptoms
      and reduces gastrointestinal gas accumulation. However, replacing regular rye
      bread by low-FODMAP bread without concomitant broader dietary changes does not
      improve quality of life or IBS-SSS. Nonetheless, inclusion of low-FODMAP rye
      bread in diet might be one way that IBS patients could increase their fibre
      intake.

TI  - Challenges of Quantifying FODMAPs in Enteral Nutrition Formulas: Evaluation of
      Artifacts and Solutions.
PG  - 1262-1271
LID - 10.1177/0148607116658763 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea associated with enteral nutrition has been attributed to
      excessive FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides,
      and polyols) content of formulas. This study aimed to readdress their FODMAP
      content by measuring fermentation-specific effects after a formula load in
      healthy participants and by defining issues with analytical methods. METHODS:
      Breath hydrogen production expressed as mean area under the curve (AUC) for 12
      hours after ingestion of 15 g lactulose or 500 mL of 1 of 2 formulas of seemingly
      different FODMAP content was evaluated in a double crossover design.
      Quantification of specified FODMAPs via enzymatic and liquid chromatographic
      assays was assessed with additional controls to investigate the influence of
      maltodextrin and sucrose present in the formulas, and alternative assays were
      applied. RESULTS: In 15 hydrogen-producing participants, AUC following both
      formulas was minimal (</=21 ppm/12 h) compared with 15 g lactulose ( P < .001).
      Elevated breath hydrogen was detectable when >2.5 g fructo-oligosaccharide was
      consumed. Maltodextrin showed dose-dependent interference with enzymatic
      measurement of fructans and coeluted with raffinose with liquid chromatography.
      Application of an alternative fructan assay that includes additional enzymes to
      hydrolyze maltodextrins indicated that fructan content was <15% of that previous 
      reported. Galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) content could not be estimated by
      chromatography due to maltodextrins. An enzymatic assay, while overestimating GOS
      content, showed it to be very low. CONCLUSION: FODMAPs were not detected in
      enteral formulas in human bioassays, and their content may be grossly
      overestimated mainly due to high formula concentrations of maltodextrin. Better
      estimates of FODMAP content in enteral formulas can be made by alternative assay 
      approaches.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To report the indications and/or recommendations by Societies 
      and Institutions for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in functional
      intestinal disorders in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS: A position by Societies and
      Institutions is available only for infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome and
      constipation. Supplementation with the probiotic L reuteri DSM 17938 in breastfed
      term infants with colic appears to be effective in reducing crying, while still
      debated is its role in the prevention of colic. Irritable bowel syndrome is a
      common disorder in children and at present no specific treatments are available; 
      existing data show that although high-quality studies are still needed, some
      evidence support the efficacy of LGG and VSL#3 in paediatric IBS. At present
      there is no evidence for the use of pre- or probiotics in childhood constipation.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics in a near future may have a definite role is some FGIDs of
      infants and children. The main limitations for the recommendation by Societies
      and Institutions are the methodological issues that limit the quality of the
      evidence and the heterogeneity of treatments (probiotic strain and dose, mode,
      dose and duration of supplementation, primary outcomes, etc). Some specific
      strains are promising for infant colic (L. reuteri DSM 17938) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (LGG) while at present there is no indication for their use in the
      treatment of childhood constipation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence
      regarding probiotics treatment for pediatric IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: The overall
      management of children with IBS should be tailored to the patient's specific
      symptoms and identifiable triggers. The four major therapeutic approaches
      include: pharmacologic, dietary, psychosocial, and complementary/alternative
      medicine interventions.Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of
      pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and anti-diarrheals, these may
      have a role in severe cases. A Cochrane review concluded that only weak evidence 
      exists regarding beneficial effects of pharmacological agents in providing relief
      from symptoms in functional abdominal pain (AP) in children. Role of antibiotics 
      in treatment of children with IBS remains controversial. Various
      non-pharmacologic treatments are available for pediatric IBS. In a recent
      systematic review including 24 studies some evidence was found indicating
      beneficial effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), cognitive behavioral 
      therapy, hypnotherapy, and probiotics (LGG and VSL#3).Few randomized clinical
      trials (RCTs) are available in children. A meta-analysis including 9 trials which
      tested different probiotics as a treatment for Functional Gastrointestinal
      Disorders (FGIDs) in children and adolescents concluded that Lactobacillus GG,
      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and VSL#3 significantly increased treatment
      success. We recently showed that, in children with IBS, a mixture of
      Bifidobacterium infantis M-63(R), breve M-16V(R) and longum BB536(R) is safe and 
      is associated with better AP control and improved quality of life when compared
      to placebo. SUMMARY: Probiotics are emerging as new therapeutic tools in FGIDs,
      due to the recognition of the importance of gut microbiota in influencing
      brain-gut interactions, and of the role played by intestinal infections in the
      genesis of AP-FGIDs. Preclinical data suggest that changes in the gut microbiota 
      can affect brain signaling systems related to pain and associated emotional
      behavior. Therefore, probiotics could play a relevant role in the management of
      FGIDs, by affecting the gut microbiota or by altering brain function and pain
      perception centrally.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical symptoms of patients with non-erosive reflux
      disease(NERD) and reflux esophagitis(RE), which is helpful to the differential
      diagnosis. METHODS: Out-patients who met the criteria of NERD or RE according to 
      the Montreal definition in Gastroenterology Department Wuhan Union Hospital from 
      2010-2014 were enrolled in our study. Clinical data were comprehensively
      collected. Incidence of disease, severity, frequency of esophageal and
      extraesophageal symptoms, and the rates of overlapping with functional dyspepsia 
      (FD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were all studied. RESULTS: Totally 446
      subjects were recruited, including 225 patients with NERD and 221 patients with
      RE. The occurrence rates of esophageal symptoms including heartburn
      [76.0%(171/225) vs 52.0%(115/221), P<0.01] and acid regurgitation [74.7%(168/225)
      vs 54.3%(120/221), P<0.05] in NERD group were significantly higher than those in 
      RE patients, with more severe and frequent (P<0.05). Despite the rates of food
      regurgitation were similar, NERD patients behaved more severely and frequently
      (P<0.05). Extraesophageal symptoms including throat burning and foreign body
      sensation in NERD group [40.9%(92/225) vs 27.6%(61/221), 42.2%(95/225) vs
      31.7%(70/221), all P<0.05] were also higher than those in RE group, the degree of
      which was more severe too (P<0.05). RE patients claimed a higher proportion of
      chronic cough. The incidences of overlapping with IBS in two groups were similar.
      But there were more patients with FD in NERD group [72.0%(162/225) vs
      62.9%(139/221), P<0.05] than in RE group. CONCLUSIONS: The menifestations and
      degree of esophageal and extraesophageal symptoms in patients with NERD or RE are
      different, as well as comorbidities such as FD and IBS. These results suggest
      that NERD and RE are independent diseases.

TI  - Dietary Interventions and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review of the Evidence.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1007/s11894-016-0517-x [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the best studied of the functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. It is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by
      symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and disordered bowel habits, which may
      include constipation, diarrhea, or both. IBS has a significant negative impact on
      patients, both financially and with regard to their quality-of-life. At present, 
      there is no cure for IBS, and while there are a number of pharmacological
      therapies available to treat IBS symptoms, they are not uniformly effective. For 
      this reason, many patients and providers are turning to dietary interventions in 
      an attempt to ameliorate IBS symptoms. At first glance, this approach appears
      reasonable as dietary interventions are generally safe and side effects,
      including potential adverse reactions with medications, are rare. However,
      although dietary interventions for IBS are frequently recommended, there is a
      paucity of data to support their use. The goals of this article are to answer key
      questions about diets currently recommended for the treatment of IBS, using the
      best available data from the literature.

TI  - [Potential immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory mechanisms of probiotics].
PG  - 43-51
AB  - UNLABELLED: The number of preclinical and clinical studies showing efficacy of
      probiotics in the treatment and prophylaxis of certain diseases, e.g. diarrhoea
      of various origin, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,
      allergies, hypercholesterolemia, bacterial vaginosis, and colorectal cancer, is
      increasing. These health benefits are often species and strain specific. This
      article provides an overview of available knowledge about the supposed mechanisms
      of probiotic microorganisms action focusing in particular on the interaction
      between probiotic and host cells. One of the results of this interaction is
      induction of pro- or anti-inflammatory immune response in the macroorganism.
      Detailed knowledge of the signalling pathways involved in the communication
      between bacterial and human cells can find application in the selection of
      optimal probiotics for the targeted treatment of selected diseases. Additional
      possibilities for their use in clinical practice are provided by genetic
      manipulation of probiotic microorganisms. KEY WORDS: probiotics inflammation
      signalling pathways immunomodulation genetic manipulation.

TI  - Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome report increased eating-associated
      symptoms, changes in dietary composition, and altered eating behaviors: a pilot
      comparison study to healthy adolescents.
PG  - 1915-1920
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About half of adult irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report
      symptoms with eating and disordered eating habits. However, little is known about
      eating in adolescent IBS patients, a common age at which eating disorders
      develop. The aim of the study was to investigate if adolescents with IBS are more
      likely than healthy controls (HCs) to experience eating-associated symptoms
      (EAS), report disordered eating patterns, and show differences in diet
      composition. METHODS: A total of 99 adolescents between 15 and 21 years-of-age
      participated (n = 48 IBS; n = 51 HCs). All subjects completed three 24-h dietary 
      recalls and questionnaires on EAS and disordered eating. KEY RESULTS: IBS
      patients were more likely to report EASs than HC (91.7% vs 28%, p < 0.001).
      Eating-associated symptoms were controlled by avoiding the offending food
      (97.7%), not eating any food even when hungry (43.2%), or vomiting after eating
      (13.6%). Compared to HC, IBS patients reported reduced daily intake of overall
      calories (1828 vs 2139; p < 0.05), fat (65.4 g vs 81.4 g, p < 0.05), and lactose 
      (8.2 g vs 12.8 g, p < 0.01). No differences were found between IBS and HC in
      screening for disordered eating patterns or BMI, though IBS patients endorsed
      using potentially unhealthy eating behaviors in an attempt to control symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Eating-associated symptoms are very common in
      adolescents with IBS and associated with changes in eating behaviors and dietary 
      composition. They do not appear to change BMI and risk for eating disorders. More
      research is needed to guide adolescents with IBS in making appropriate dietary
      changes to control EASs.

TI  - Nonceliac gluten sensitivity: an approach to diagnosis and management.
PG  - 638-43
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000392 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Symptoms attributed to gluten consumption are frequently
      reported evoking the need for differentiating nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)
      from other gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and wheat allergy.
      This review discusses diagnostic criteria and research to date on the
      pathogenesis and diagnosis of NCGS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is recent evidence to 
      support NCGS as a distinct clinical entity. The symptoms attributed to NCGS are
      nonspecific, overlapping with those reported in patients with celiac disease and 
      irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast to celiac disease and wheat allergy, the
      diagnosis of NCGS is more challenging because there are no specific clinical
      biomarkers and because the pathogenesis of NCGS is largely not well understood.
      The pathogenesis of NCGS may reflect alterations in innate immunity to gluten or 
      other components of wheat, may be linked with autoimmunity, or is a result of a
      reaction to gluten as a fermentable carbohydrate. SUMMARY: NCGS is a newly
      characterized and evolving clinical entity that requires ruling out other causes 
      of wheat-related or gluten-related gastrointestinal symptoms, including celiac
      disease and wheat allergy, coupled with double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
      challenge with gluten.

AB  - In the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), loperamide seems efficacious 
      for diarrhea and ispaghula for constipation, while musculotropic spasmolytics may
      relieve abdominal pain. Antidepressants were found to be efficacious for
      abdominal pain, but their tolerance may be problematic and the therapeutic effect
      varied largely between trials. While meta-analyses suggest efficacy of probiotics
      as a group, the quality of the trials is often suboptimal and there is large
      variability. Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, and linaclotide, a
      guanylyl cyclase-C agonist, showed favorable effects on multiple symptoms in IBS 
      with constipation. For IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
      ramosetron showed efficacy in men and women, but is currently only approved in
      Japan. A multicenter study with the anti-emetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
      ondansetron showed efficacy on stool pattern in IBS-D. The poorly absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and eluxadoline, a mu opioid receptor agonist and delta
      antagonist, both showed efficacy in phase III trials in IBS-D and were approved
      by the FDA. Eluxadoline was associated with increased occurrence of sphincter of 
      Oddi spasm and biliary pancreatitis. The non-pharmacological treatment of IBS,
      with dietary interventions (mainly gluten elimination and low FODMAP (fructose,
      oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols)) has received a lot of attention
      lately. While responder rates vary across studies, perhaps based on regional
      variations in dietary intake of FODMAPs, the dietary approach seems to have
      acquired recognition as a valid therapeutic alternative. Long-term studies and
      comparative studies with pharmacotherapy, as well as elucidation of the
      underlying mechanisms of action, are needed.

TI  - Dietary patterns and prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in Iranian adults.
PG  - 1921-1933
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several dietary factors have been reported to alleviate or
      aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), no information is
      available linking habitual dietary patterns to irritable bowel syndrome.
      OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the association between dietary
      patterns and the risk of IBS among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, data on 3846 Iranian adults working in 50 different health
      centers were examined. Dietary intake of study participants was assessed using a 
      106-item self-administered Dish-based Semi-quantitative Food Frequency
      Questionnaire (DS-FFQ) which was designed and validated specifically for Iranian 
      adults. To identify major dietary patterns based on the 39 food groups, we used
      principal component analysis. A modified Persian version of the Rome III
      questionnaire was used for assessment of IBS. RESULTS: We identified four major
      dietary patterns: (i) 'fast food', (ii) 'traditional', (iii) 'lacto-vegetarian', 
      and (iv) 'western' dietary pattern. After adjustment for potential confounders,
      we found that those in the highest quartile of 'fast food' dietary pattern were
      tended to have higher risk of IBS than those in the lowest quartile (OR = 1.32;
      95% CI: 0.99, 1.75, ptrend = 0.05). An inverse association was also found between
      'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern and risk of IBS; such that even after
      adjustment for potential confounders, those in top quartile of this dietary
      pattern were 24% less likely to have IBS (0.76; 0.59, 0.98; ptrend = 0.02). No
      overall significant associations were observed between 'traditional' and
      'western' dietary patterns and risk of IBS, either before or after adjustment for
      covariates. CONCLUSION: We found that 'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern was
      associated with reduced risk, while 'fast food' dietary pattern was associated
      with a greater risk of IBS in Iranian adults.

TI  - [Non-allergic gluten sensitivity. A controversial disease - or not yet
      sufficiently explored?].
PG  - 821-6
LID - 10.1007/s00103-016-2366-z [doi]
AB  - The avoidance of wheat, gluten and other cereal products is a growing phenomenon 
      in industrialized countries. The diagnostic criteria of celiac disease and of
      food allergy to wheat flour and/or other cereals are clearly defined. Only about 
      0.5-25 % of the population are affected from both of these immunological
      diseases.Nevertheless, there exists a significantly greater proportion of people 
      reporting at least subjectively significant complaints and quality of life
      improvements after switching to a wheat- or gluten-free diet. Celiac disease or
      wheat allergy cannot be detected in these individuals on the basis of established
      criteria. The absence of clear diagnostic autoimmune or allergic criteria in
      these wheat sensitive patients has resulted in the description of non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity.It is clinically detectable in only very few individuals and
      may manifest with either intestinal, extra-intestinal or neurovegetative and
      psychosomatic symptoms, respectively. However, non-celiac disease gluten
      sensitivity has to be differentiated critically from irritable bowel syndrome,
      carbohydrate malassimilation, postinfectious conditions and psychosomatic
      diseases.Pathophysiologically, non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity is still
      poorly characterized; several non-immunological mechanisms are discussed to
      contribute to non-celiac gluten sensitivity. These include the effects of fructo-
      and galacto-oligosaccharides, of trypsin inhibitors of amylase, and wheat lectin 
      agglutinins, which may influence or modulate intestinal permeability and/or a
      non-specific immune or effector cell degranulation within the gastrointestinal
      tract. In addition, further metabolic effects with direct or indirect influence
      on the intestinal flora are currently discussed.In addition to subjectively
      reported changes in symptoms that may affect variably intestinal, as well as
      extra-intestinal and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms, some studies suggest that
      there is little reproducibility of complaints from gluten exposure. For a
      definitive diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, structured (blinded)
      challenge tests with wheat or gluten are mandatory as well as re-challenge after 
      a defined time of gluten avoidance to establish non-celiac disease gluten
      sensitivity as a persistent disease entity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently identify foods 
      as exacerbating their gastrointestinal symptoms. In children with IBS, the
      prevalence of perceived food intolerances and their impact are unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of self-perceived food
      intolerances and the relationship of these intolerances to abdominal pain,
      psychosocial distress, and quality of life in children with IBS. DESIGN: We
      conducted a cross-sectional study. Questionnaire and prospective diary data were 
      collected from 2008 to 2014 by trained research coordinators.
      PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were children 7 to 18 years old (pediatric
      Rome III IBS, n=154; age-sex matched healthy children, n=32) in Houston, TX.
      MEASURES: Perceived food intolerances and avoided foods were captured using the
      Childhood Food and Symptom Association Questionnaire. IBS severity was assessed
      by a >/=7-day pain diary and validated psychosocial questionnaires assessing
      quality of life, somatization, functional disability, depression, and anxiety.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: We used descriptive Spearman bivariate
      correlation, chi(2), and Poisson log-linear generalized model with Wald chi(2)
      statistics. RESULTS: A greater proportion of children with IBS (143 of 154
      [92.9%]) vs healthy children (20 of 32 [62.5%]) identified at least one
      self-perceived food intolerance (chi(2)=22.5; P<0.001). Children with IBS
      identified a greater number (median=4 [25% to 75% quartile=2 to 6]) of perceived 
      symptom-inducing foods than healthy children (median=2 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to 
      4]; chi(2)=28.6; P<0.001). Children with IBS avoided more foods (median=2 [25% to
      75% quartile=1 to 4]) than healthy children (median=0 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to
      2.75]; chi(2)=20.8; P<0.001). The number of self-perceived food intolerances was 
      weakly associated (r value range= -0.17 to 0.21) with pain frequency, pain
      severity, somatization, anxiety, functional disability, and decreased quality of 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBS have a high prevalence of self-perceived
      food intolerances. The number of these intolerances is weakly associated with
      measures of IBS severity.

      syndrome diagnosed by Rome III criteria: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s12876-016-0470-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional
      gastroenterological diseases, affecting 11.2 % of people worldwide. Previous
      studies have shown that probiotic treatment may benefit IBS patients. However,
      the effect of probiotics and the appropriate type, dose, and treatment duration
      for IBS are still unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess the
      efficacy of different probiotic types, doses and treatment durations in IBS
      patients diagnosed by Rome III criteria via a meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials up to October 2015 were searched. RCTs including
      comparisons between the effects of probiotics and placebo on IBS patients
      diagnosed by Rome III criteria were eligible. Dichotomous data were pooled to
      obtain the relative risk (RR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI), whereas
      continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95 
      % CI. RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Probiotic
      therapy was associated with more improvement than placebo administration in
      overall symptom response (RR: 1.82, 95 % CI 1.27 to 2.60) and quality of life
      (QoL) (SMD: 0.29, 95 % CI 0.08 to 0.50), but not in individual IBS symptoms.
      Single probiotics, a low dose, and a short treatment duration were more effective
      with respect to overall symptom response and QoL. No differences were detected in
      individual IBS symptoms in the subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are an
      effective pharmacological therapy in IBS patients. Single probiotics at a low
      dose and with a short treatment duration appear to be more effective in improving
      overall symptom response and QoL, but more evidence for these effects is still
      needed.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined as a representative functional
      gastrointestinal disorder which is characterized by chronic or recurrent
      abdominal pain and/or abdominal discomfort associated with abnormal bowel
      movement. Gut microbiota are related to the pathophysiology of IBS. In the field 
      of IBS, post-infectious etiology, stress-induced alteration of microbiota,
      increased mucosal permeability, bacterial overgrowth, disease-specific
      microbiota, microbial products, and brain-gut interactions are being
      investigated. In some individuals, IBS develops after recovery from acute
      gastroenteritis known as post-infectious IBS. Gut microbiota in IBS patients
      differ from those in healthy individuals, and the profiles of gut microbiota in
      IBS patients also vary among IBS patients with constipation, diarrhea, and mixed 
      subtypes. In Japan, gut microbiota in IBS patients also differ from those
      observed in healthy individuals, and organic acid by-products observed in the
      patients correlated with symptoms, quality of life, and alexithymia. Further
      research on gut microbiota in IBS patients is warranted.

TI  - British Dietetic Association systematic review and evidence-based practice
      guidelines for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016
      update).
PG  - 549-75
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines for the
      dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults were published in 
      2012. Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this work
      was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the management 
      of IBS and to update the guidelines. METHODS: Twelve questions relating to diet
      and IBS were defined based on review of the previous guideline questions, current
      evidence and clinical practice. Chosen topics were on healthy eating and
      lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, elimination diets, fat and fluid
      intakes and dietary habits), milk and dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable
      carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and elimination diets/food hypersensitivity.
      Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase,
      Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to October 2015. Studies were assessed
      independently in duplicate using risk of bias tools specific to each included
      study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for each question. National
      Health and Medical Research Council grading evidence levels were used to develop 
      evidence statements and recommendations, in accordance with Practice-based
      Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the BDA. RESULTS: Eighty-six
      studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence statements, 15 clinical
      recommendations and four research recommendations. The IBS dietary algorithm was 
      simplified to first-line (healthy eating, provided by any healthcare
      professional) and second-line [low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) to be provided by dietitian] dietary 
      advice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide updated comprehensive
      evidence-based details to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS in
      adults.

TI  - British Dietetic Association systematic review of systematic reviews and
      evidence-based practice guidelines for the use of probiotics in the management of
      irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016 update).
PG  - 576-92
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are often taken by individuals with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Which products are effective is unclear, despite an increasing
      research base. This project will systematically review which strain- and dose-
      specific probiotics can be recommended to adults with IBS to improve symptoms and
      quality of life (QoL). It is part of a broader systematic review to update
      British Dietetic Association guidelines for the dietary management of IBS in
      adults. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science
      were searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trial (RCT)s 
      recruiting adults with IBS comparing probiotic intervention with placebo. AMSTAR,
      risk of bias and diet bias tools were used to appraise methodological quality.
      Symptom and QoL data were appraised to develop probiotic-specific evidence
      statements on clinically meaningful and marginal outcomes in various settings,
      graded clinical practice recommendations and practical considerations. RESULTS:
      Nine systematic reviews and 35 RCTs were included (3406 participants) using 29
      dose-specific probiotic formulations. None of the RCTs were at low risk of bias. 
      Twelve out of 29 probiotics (41%) showed no symptom or QoL benefits. Evidence
      indicated that no strain or dose specific probiotic was consistently effective to
      improve any IBS symptoms or QoL. Two general clinical practice recommendations
      were made. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom outcomes for dose-specific probiotics were
      heterogeneous. Specific probiotic recommendations for IBS management in adults
      were not possible at this time. More data from high-quality RCTs treating
      specific symptom profiles are needed to support probiotic therapy in the
      management of IBS.

AB  - Biological markers that measure gut health and diagnose functional
      gastro-intestinal (GI) disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are
      lacking. The objective was to identify and validate a biomarker panel associated 
      with the pathophysiology of IBS that discriminates IBS from healthy controls
      (HC), and correlates with GI symptom severity. In a case-control design, various 
      plasma and fecal markers were measured in a cohort of 196 clinical IBS patients
      and 160 HC without GI symptoms. A combination of biomarkers, which best
      discriminates between IBS and HC was identified and validated in an independent
      internal validation set and by permutation testing. The correlation between the
      biomarker panel and GI symptom severity was tested in IBS patients and in a
      general population cohort of 958 subjects. A set of 8 biomarker panel was
      identified to discriminate IBS from HC with high sensitivity (88.1%) and
      specificity (86.5%). The results for the IBS subtypes were comparable. Moreover, 
      a moderate correlation was found between the biomarker panel and GI symptom
      scores in the IBS (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and the general population cohorts (r =
      0.51, p = 0.003). A novel multi-domain biomarker panel has been identified and
      validated, which correlated moderately to GI symptom severity in IBS and general 
      population subjects.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is probably the most common functional gastrointestinal 
      disorder and is characterized by abdominal pain along with altered bowel
      function. It is a disorder of female predominance. This article focuses on how
      being female influences the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and treatment
      of this common disorder and discusses the evidence and important controversies
      related to these areas.

AB  - Several key areas in gastroenterology pharmacotherapy are rapidly evolving,
      including the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV), irritable bowel syndrome,
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease. HCV treatment
      has radically changed in the past 2 years and now most patients are treatment
      candidates and have a high likelihood of permanent cure. Pharmacotherapy is now
      first-line treatment for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of therapy in
      gastric and duodenal ulcers and GERD, although long-term use carries the risk of 
      several side effects that should be considered.

TI  - Clinical Practice Guideline: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and
      functional constipation in the adult.
PG  - 332-63
LID - 10.17235/reed.2016.4389/2016 [doi]
AB  - In this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic
      approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the
      confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. 
      Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a
      significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of
      life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel
      syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in
      association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension.
      Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel
      movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of
      incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are
      therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and 
      pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond
      similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or 
      absence of pain, albeit not in an "all or nothing" manner. Severity depends not
      only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors
      (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of
      involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders
      are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been 
      made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016,
      and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between
      Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available
      treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods,
      fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating
      laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence,
      prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants,
      psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation,
      surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of 
      them.

TI  - The neurokinin-2 receptor antagonist ibodutant improves overall symptoms,
      abdominal pain and stool pattern in female patients in a phase II study of
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS.
PG  - 1403-1413
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310683 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tachykinins have been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS with
      diarrhoea (IBS-D). Our aim was to study the efficacy and safety of ibodutant, a
      selective neurokinin-2 (NK2) receptor antagonist, in patients with IBS-D.
      METHODS: This multinational double-blind, placebo-controlled study recruited 559 
      patients with IBS-D according to Rome III criteria. After a 2-week treatment-free
      run-in, patients were randomised to ibodutant 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg or placebo once
      daily for eight consecutive weeks. Responders were those with a combined response
      of satisfactory relief (weekly binary question yes/no) of overall IBS symptoms
      and abdominal pain/discomfort on >/=75% weeks (primary end point). Secondary end 
      points included abdominal pain and stool pattern. Data were also analysed
      according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved interim end points
      (improvement of pain and stool consistency). Safety was assessed by monitoring
      adverse events and laboratory tests. Prespecified statistical analysis involved
      the whole group as well as gender subgroups. RESULTS: Demographics and baseline
      characteristics were comparable for all treatment arms. In the overall
      population, responsiveness tended to increase with escalating ibodutant doses. In
      the prespecified analysis by gender, ibodutant 10 mg demonstrated significant
      superiority over placebo in females (p=0.003), while no significant effect
      occurred in males. This was confirmed for secondary end points and for the
      responder analysis according to FDA-approved end points. The tolerability and
      safety of ibodutant was excellent at all doses. CONCLUSIONS: Ibodutant showed
      dose-dependent efficacy response in IBS-D, reaching statistical significance at
      the 10 mg dose in female patients. The safety and tolerability profile of
      ibodutant was similar to placebo. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01303224.

TI  - Is There a Role for the Enteral Administration of Serum-Derived Immunoglobulins
      in Human Gastrointestinal Disease and Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition?
PG  - 535-43
LID - 10.3945/an.115.011924 [doi]
AB  - Twenty years ago, there was profound, international interest in developing oral
      human, bovine, or chicken egg-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) for the prevention and 
      nutritional treatment of childhood malnutrition and gastrointestinal disease,
      including acute diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. Although such Ig products
      were shown to be effective, with both nutritional and antidiarrheal benefits,
      interest waned because of their cost and because of the perceived risk of bovine 
      serum encephalitis (BSE). BSE is no longer considered a barrier to use of oral
      Ig, because the WHO has declared the United States to be BSE-free since the early
      2000s. Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed 
      and are regulated as medical foods. These new products, called serum bovine Igs
      (SBIs), facilitate the management of chronic or severe gastrointestinal
      disturbances in both children and adults and are regulated by the US Food and
      Drug Administration. Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could
      potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other
      conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control
      without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in
      conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could
      potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for 
      their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential 
      process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, 
      thereby leading to intestinal inflammation. Thus, oral Ig may emerge as an
      important "add-on" therapy for a variety of gastrointestinal and nutritional
      problems during the next decade.

TI  - Efficacy of double-coated probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized
      double-blind controlled trial.
PG  - 432-443
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1224-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of a
      dual-coated probiotic supplement (Duolac Care) on symptoms of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a randomized double-blind
      clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty subjects with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome were randomly assigned to either the non-coating group or the
      dual-coating group in order to receive two capsules per day of multi-species
      probiotics containing 5 billion bacteria per capsule for 4 weeks. Data from an
      adequate relief questionnaire were used in assessment of primary outcome. Daily
      records of stool frequencies and the Bristol stool scale, a weekly symptom diary 
      using 100-mm visual analog scale, and Beck depression inventories were collected.
      Blood tests including blood cell counts, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and regulatory T cells-CD4 +
      CD25(high) T cells, CD4 + LAP + T cells and CD25(high) + LAP + T cells-were
      analyzed before and after the study. The shift of gut microbiota was investigated
      using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS:
      Responses to the adequate relief questionnaire indicated significant improvement 
      in overall discomfort in the dual-coating group and the ratio of normal stools to
      hard or watery stools had a better effect from dual-coated probiotics compared to
      non-coated probiotics. This may be due to a shift of intestinal microbiota, as
      our correlation analysis showed significant negative correlation between
      Bifidobacterium and urgency of defecation. CONCLUSIONS: Our result implies that
      dual-coating layers of probiotic supplement can be a candidate for treatment of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - A number of diseases are associated with alterations in the composition of the
      microbiota of various niches of the human body. Although, in most cases, it is
      unclear if these alterations are the cause or the consequence of disease, they
      provide a rationale for therapeutic or prophylactic manipulation of a dysbiotic
      microbiota. Approaches to manipulate the microbiome include administration of
      either live bacteria, which are underrepresented in the diseased individual,
      substances that aim at increasing the populations of these bacteria, or a
      combination of the two. This chapter summarizes the available data in therapeutic
      manipulation of a various diseased states including irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, atopic and allergic
      diseases, and antibiotic-associated and infectious diarrhoea.

TI  - Effects of synbiotic fermented milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and
      Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 on the fecal microbiota of adults with
      irritable bowel syndrome: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentric study to 
      investigate the influence of a synbiotic fermented milk on the fecal microbiota
      composition of 30 adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The synbiotic
      product contained Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp.
      lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and dietary fiber (90% inulin, 10%
      oligofructose), and a heat-treated fermented milk without probiotic bacteria or
      dietary fiber served as placebo. Stool samples were collected after a run-in
      period, a 4-wk consumption period, and a 1-wk follow-up period, and were
      subjected to real-time PCR and 16S rDNA profiling by next-generation sequencing. 
      After 4wk of synbiotic (11 subjects) or placebo (19 subjects) consumption, a
      greater increase in DNA specific for L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium
      animalis ssp. lactis was detected in the feces of the synbiotic group compared
      with the placebo group by quantitative real-time PCR. After 1wk of follow-up, the
      content of L. acidophilus La-5 and B. animalis ssp. lactis decreased to levels
      close to initial levels. No significant changes with time or differences between 
      the groups were observed for Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, 
      or all bacteria. The presence of viable BB-12- and La-5-like bacteria in the
      feces resulting from the intake of synbiotic product was confirmed by random
      amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. At the end of consumption period,
      the feces of all subjects assigned to the synbiotic group contained viable
      bacteria with a BB-12-like RAPD profile, and after 1wk of follow-up, BB-12-like
      bacteria remained in the feces of 87.5% of these subjects. The presence of
      La-5-like colonies was observed less frequently (37.5 and 25% of subjects,
      respectively). Next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons revealed that
      only the percentage of sequences assigned to Strep. thermophilus was temporarily 
      increased in both groups, whereas the global profile of the fecal microbiota of
      patients was not altered by consumption of the synbiotic or placebo. In
      conclusion, daily consumption of a synbiotic fermented milk had a short-term
      effect on the amount and proportion of La-5-like strains and B. animalis ssp.
      lactis in the fecal microbiome of IBS patients. Furthermore, both synbiotic and
      placebo products caused a temporary increase in fecal Strep. thermophilus.

TI  - Volatile organic compounds in breath as markers for irritable bowel syndrome: a
      metabolomic approach.
PG  - 45-56
LID - 10.1111/apt.13654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is challenging
      because of its heterogeneity and multifactorial pathophysiology. No reliable
      biomarkers of IBS have been identified so far. AIMS: In a case-control study,
      using a novel application of breath analysis to distinguish IBS patients from
      healthy controls based on the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
      Subsequently, the diagnostic VOC-biomarker set was correlated with self-reported 
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of subjects of the Maastricht IBS clinical cohort 
      and of a general population cohort, LifeLines DEEP. METHODS: Breath samples were 
      collected from 170 IBS patients and 153 healthy controls in the clinical cohort
      and from 1307 participants in general population cohort. Multivariate statistics 
      were used to identify the most discriminatory set of VOCs in the clinical cohort,
      and to find associations between VOCs and GI symptoms in both cohorts. RESULTS: A
      set of 16 VOCs correctly predicted 89.4% of the IBS patients and 73.3% of the
      healthy controls (AUC = 0.83). The VOC-biomarker set correlated moderately with a
      set of GI symptoms in the clinical (r = 0.55, P = 0.0003) and general population 
      cohorts (r = 0.54, P = 0.0004). A Kruskal-Wallis test showed no influence from
      possible confounding factors in distinguishing IBS patients from healthy
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: A set of 16 breath-based biomarkers that distinguishes IBS
      patients from healthy controls was identified. The VOC-biomarker set correlated
      significantly with GI symptoms in two independent cohorts. We demonstrate the
      potential use of breath analysis in the diagnosis and monitoring of IBS, and a
      possible application of VOC analyses in a general population cohort.

TI  - Faecal short-chain fatty acids - a diagnostic biomarker for irritable bowel
      syndrome?
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s12876-016-0446-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) relies on
      symptom-based criteria. A valid and reliable biomarker that could confirm the
      diagnosis is desirable. This study evaluated the properties of faecal short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFA) as diagnostic biomarkers for IBS. METHODS: Twenty-five
      subjects with IBS and 25 controls were included in this explanatory case-control 
      study. Stool samples were analysed for SCFA (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric
      acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and isovaleric acid) with gas chromatography
      and reported as mmol/l and molar%. In the search for the best way to distinguish 
      between subjects with and without IBS, the total amount and the amount of each of
      the SCFA were measured, and the proportions and differences between the SCFA were
      calculated. RESULTS: In the IBS and control group, the mean age was 46.2 (SD
      12.9) and 49.2 (SD 14.6), and the number of females was 13/25 (52 %) and 15/25
      (60 %) respectively. The difference between propionic and butyric acid (mmol/l)
      had the best diagnostic properties, the area under the Receiver Operating
      Characteristic curve was 0.89 (95 % CI: 0.80-0.98) (p < 0.001). With a cut-off
      value > 0.015 mmol/l indicating IBS, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were 92 %, 72 %, 3.29, 0.11 
      and 29.6 respectively. Similar diagnostic properties were shown for all the IBS
      subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that faecal SCFA could be a
      non-invasive, valid and reliable biomarker for the differentiation of healthy
      subjects from subjects with IBS.

TI  - Oridonin Alleviates Visceral Hyperalgesia in a Rat Model of Postinflammatory
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Role of Colonic Enterochromaffin Cell and Serotonin
      Availability.
PG  - 586-92
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2015.3595 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this present study was to investigate the effect of oridonin on
      visceral hyperalgesia and colonic serotonin availability in a rat model of
      trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced postinflammatory irritable bowel syndrome
      (PI-IBS). Rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal control, PI-IBS
      model, PI-IBS+low-dose oridonin (5 mg/kg), PI-IBS+median-dose oridonin (10
      mg/kg), and PI-IBS+high-dose oridonin (20 mg/kg). Rats in control and model
      groups were orally administered with water by gavage, whereas rats in
      oridonin-treated groups were orally administered with different dosages of
      oridonin, and drugs were given for 14 consecutive days. Compared with the control
      group, the pain threshold pressure was significantly reduced in PI-IBS rats. The 
      colonic enterochromaffin (EC) cell number, serotonin content, and the protein
      expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) were markedly increased and the
      protein expression of serotonin reuptake transporter was significantly decreased 
      in PI-IBS rats. The spleen index in PI-IBS rats was decreased, and the levels of 
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4,
      and IL-13 in the colon of PI-IBS rats were also markedly decreased. Oridonin
      treatment dose dependently increased pain threshold pressure, and markedly
      decreased colon EC cell numbers, TPH expression, and serotonin content in PI-IBS 
      rats. Oridonin treatment also significantly increased the spleen index as well as
      the levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-13 in the colon of PI-IBS rats. 
      Results of this study demonstrate that the analgesic effect of oridonin in PI-IBS
      rats is associated with reduced colonic EC cell hyperplasia and 5-HT
      availability, the regulatory effect of oridonin on colonic cytokine production
      may be correlated with its effect on colonic EC cell number.

TI  - Follow-up of patients with functional bowel symptoms treated with a low FODMAP
      diet.

AB  - AIM: To investigate patient-reported outcomes from, and adherence to, a low
      FODMAP diet among patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome and
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Consecutive patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and co-existing IBS fulfilling
      the ROME III criteria, who previously attended an outpatient clinic for low
      FODMAP diet (LFD) dietary management and assessment by a gastroenterologist, were
      invited to participate in a retrospective questionnaire analysis. The
      questionnaires were sent and returned by regular mail and gathered information on
      recall of dietary treatment, efficacy, symptoms, adherence, satisfaction, change 
      in disease course and stool type, and quality of life. Before study enrolment all
      patients had to sign an informed written consent. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty
      patients were included, 131 (73%) IBS and 49 (27%) IBD patients. Median age was
      43 years (range: 18-85) and 147 (82%) were females. Median follow-up time was 16 
      mo (range: 2-80). Eighty-six percent reported either partial (54%) or full (32%) 
      efficacy with greatest improvement of bloating (82%) and abdominal pain (71%).
      The proportion of patients with full efficacy tended to be greater in the IBD
      group than in the IBS group (42% vs 29%, P = 0.08). There was a significant
      reduction in patients with a chronic continuous disease course in both the IBS
      group (25%, P < 0.001) and IBD group (23%, P = 0.002) along with a significant
      increase in patients with a mild indolent disease course of 37% (P < 0.001) and
      23% (P = 0.002), respectively. The proportion of patients having normal stools
      increased with 41% in the IBS group (P < 0.001) and 66% in the IBD group (P <
      0.001). One-third of patients adhered to the diet and high adherence was
      associated with longer duration of dietary course (P < 0.001). Satisfaction with 
      dietary management was seen in 83 (70%) IBS patients and 24 (55%) IBD patients.
      Eighty-four percent of patients lived on a modified LFD, where some foods rich in
      FODMAPs were reintroduced, and 16% followed the LFD by the book without
      deviations. Wheat, dairy products, and onions were the foods most often not
      reintroduced by patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a diet low in
      FODMAPs is an efficacious treatment solution in the management of functional
      bowel symptoms for IBS and IBD patients.

TI  - Corticotropin-releasing factor increases ascending colon volume after a fructose 
      test meal in healthy humans: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1318-26
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.115.125047 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poorly absorbed fermentable carbohydrates can provoke irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms by escaping absorption in the small bowel and being
      rapidly fermented in the colon in some susceptible subjects. IBS patients often
      are anxious and stressed, and stress accelerates small bowel transit, which may
      exacerbate malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the effect of 
      an intravenous injection of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on fructose
      malabsorption and the resulting volume of water in the small bowel. DESIGN: We
      performed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of CRF compared with
      saline injection in 11 male and 10 female healthy subjects, examining the effect 
      on the malabsorption of a 40-g fructose test meal and its transit through the
      gut, which was assessed by serial MRI and breath hydrogen measurement. Orocecal
      transit was assessed with the use of the lactose [(13)C]ureide breath test and
      the adrenal response to CRF was assessed by serial salivary cortisol
      measurements. RESULTS: CRF injection caused a significant increase in salivary
      cortisol, which lasted for 135 min. Small bowel water content (SBWC) rose from
      baseline, peaking at 45 min after fructose ingestion, whereas breath hydrogen
      peaked later, at 75 min. The area under the curve for SBWC from -15 min to 135
      min was significantly lower after CRF compared with saline [mean difference: 5911
      mL . min (95% CI: 18.4, 11,803 mL . min), P = 0.049]. Considering all subjects,
      the percentage change in ascending colon volume rose significantly after CRF.
      This increase was significant for male (P = 0.026), but not female, volunteers.
      CONCLUSIONS: CRF constricts the small bowel and increases fructose malabsorption,
      as shown by increased ascending colon volumes. This mechanism may help to explain
      the increased sensitivity of some stressed individuals to fructose malabsorption.
      This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01763281.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to determine the efficacy of psyllium fiber
      treatment on abdominal pain and stool patterns in children with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We evaluated effects on breath hydrogen and methane production,
      gut permeability, and microbiome composition. We also investigated whether
      psychological characteristics of children or parents affected the response to
      treatment. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of 103 children
      (mean age, 13 +/- 3 y) with IBS seen at primary or tertiary care settings. After 
      2 weeks on their habitual diet, children began an 8-day diet excluding
      carbohydrates thought to cause symptoms of IBS. Children with >/=75% improvement 
      in abdominal pain were excluded (n = 17). Children were assigned randomly to
      groups given psyllium (n = 37) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 47) for 6 weeks.
      Two-week pain and stool diaries were compared at baseline and during the final 2 
      weeks of treatment. We assessed breath hydrogen and methane production,
      intestinal permeability, and the composition of the microbiome before and after
      administration of psyllium or placebo. Psychological characteristics of children 
      were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Children in the psyllium group had a greater 
      reduction in the mean number of pain episodes than children in the placebo group 
      (mean reduction of 8.2 +/- 1.2 after receiving psyllium vs mean reduction of 4.1 
      +/- 1.3 after receiving placebo; P = .03); the level of pain intensity did not
      differ between the groups. Psychological characteristics were not associated with
      response. At the end of the study period, the percentage of stools that were
      normal (Bristol scale scores, 3-5), breath hydrogen or methane production,
      intestinal permeability, and microbiome composition were similar between groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium fiber reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes in
      children with IBS, independent of psychological factors. Psyllium did not alter
      breath hydrogen or methane production, gut permeability, or microbiome
      composition. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00526903.

AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBDs) are the most common gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders seen by gastroenterologists and primary care physicians. The disorders 
      affect patients functioning and quality of life (QOL) and are associated with
      significant healthcare burden. The current theory regarding the development of
      FBDs suggests brain-gut axis dysfunctions associated abnormal GI motility and
      sensation. Recent data suggest that alterations in the intestinal microbiota may 
      have a role in the pathogenesis of FBDs; or at least have the potential to affect
      intestinal functions that are thought to be relevant to the development of
      functional GI symptoms. This has led to growing interest of healthcare providers 
      and patients in targeting the intestinal microbiota for the treatment of FBDs. In
      this article we discuss the potential role probiotic interventions in the
      treatment of FBDs. We review the evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies 
      and discuss the current recommendations for the use of probiotics for FBDs in
      clinical practice.

PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2016.53 [doi]
AB  - Constipation is a heterogeneous, polysymptomatic, multifactorial disease. Acute
      or transient constipation can be due to changes in diet, travel or stress, and
      secondary constipation can result from drug treatment, neurological or metabolic 
      conditions or, rarely, colon cancer. A diagnosis of primary chronic constipation 
      is made after exclusion of secondary causes of constipation and encompasses
      several overlapping subtypes. Slow-transit constipation is characterized by
      prolonged colonic transit in the absence of pelvic floor dysfunction. This
      subtype of constipation can be identified using either the radio-opaque marker
      test or wireless motility capsule test, and is best treated with laxatives such
      as polyethylene glycol or newer agents such as linaclotide or lubiprostone. If
      unsuccessful, subspecialist referral should be considered. Dyssynergic defecation
      results from impaired coordination of rectoanal and pelvic floor muscles, and
      causes difficulty with defecation. The condition can be identified using
      anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion tests and is best managed with
      biofeedback therapy. Opioid-induced constipation is an emerging entity, and
      several drugs including naloxegol, methylnaltrexone and lubiprostone are approved
      for its treatment. In this Review, we provide an overview of the burden and
      pathophysiology of chronic constipation, as well as a detailed discussion of the 
      available diagnostic tools and treatment options.

      Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 30866
LID - 10.3402/ljm.v11.30866 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal
      disorder that can cause disability and economic burden. Nurses are a vital part
      of the medical team and their well-being is an important issue. Yet, few studies 
      have been done concerning IBS among nurses. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      prevalence, severity, and predictors of IBS among nurses working at King
      Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 229 nurses who fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria. They were selected by stratified random sampling during
      2014-2015. A validated, confidential, self-administered data collection sheet was
      used for collection of personal and sociodemographic data. Rome III Criteria, IBS
      Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 
      and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were included. Both descriptive and
      inferential statistics were done. A multiple logistic regression analysis was
      done to determine the predictors of IBS. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS among
      nurses was 14.4%, and IBS-Mixed type was the commonest variety (54.5%). Positive 
      family history of IBS, working in outpatient clinics, having day shift, poor
      sleep quality, and high anxiety and depression scale scores were significantly
      associated with IBS. After controlling for confounding factors in regression
      analysis, the predictors of IBS were food hypersensitivity (aOR=4.52; 95% CI:
      1.80-11.33), morbid anxiety (aOR=4.34; 95% CI: 1.49-12.67), and positive family
      history of IBS (aOR=3.38; 95% CI: 1.12-13.23). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IBS 
      was 14.4%. Food hypersensitivity, morbid anxiety, and family history were the
      predictors of IBS. Screening and management of IBS, food hypersensitivity, and
      psychological problems among nurses are recommended.

PG  - 251-9
LID - 10.1159/000443359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. This review summarizes
      current (i.e. published in the last 5 years) key evidence on probiotic efficacy
      and its safety in adults and children. To identify relevant data, searches of
      MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in August 2015 to
      locate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or their meta-analyses. The focus was 
      on commonly used, well-specified, bacterial and yeast probiotics for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The MEDLINE database was also searched
      for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, developed by scientific
      societies in the same timeframe. Data on safety of probiotics were obtained from 
      a document developed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. KEY
      MESSAGES: A number of relevant RCTs and meta-analyses are available.
      Saccharomyces boulardii is the most studied yeast probiotic, and Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG is the most studied bacterial probiotic. For both, the best
      documented fact is their efficacy for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis,
      especially in children, and for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea,
      both in adults and children. There is some evidence to support the use of
      probiotics to prevent or treat other diseases, such as necrotizing enterocolitis,
      infantile colic, Helicobacter pylori infection, and irritable bowel syndrome, but
      further studies are needed to identify which strain(s) is/are the most effective.
      Data on safety, particularly long-term safety, are limited. The risk of side
      effects is greater in people who have severe underlying health conditions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on bacterial and yeast probiotics has considerably
      expanded during recent years. Accumulated data allow one to make informed
      decisions about the effectiveness of probiotics and about how to reduce the use
      of those without proven efficacy.

TI  - Overview of the role of vitamins and minerals on the kynurenine pathway in health
      and disease.
PG  - 3-19
AB  - The kynurenine pathway (KP) of L-tryptophan metabolism produces several
      neuroactive metabolites with an amino acid structure. These metabolites may play 
      an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, AIDS-dementia 
      complex, depression, epilepsy and the aging process. Modulation of the KP through
      inhibition or stimulation of enzyme synthesis and activity can be an alternative 
      approach to traditional therapy. Furthermore, it may be responsible for the
      altered functioning of the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system.
      There is evidence that the KP is sensitive to changes in the concentration of
      many vitamins and minerals that play a crucial role as coenzymes and cofactors in
      the de novo synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme. A reduction 
      in the availability of the active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate,
      PLP) is known to affect tryptophan hydroxylase, kynurenine aminotransferase and
      kynureninase (KYNU). Vitamin B2 deficiencies result in a reduction in the
      activity of the flavin adenine dinucleotide dependent enzyme, kynurenine
      3-monooxygenase. Minerals are also responsible for the proper functioning of
      enzymes engaged in L-tryptophan metabolism. Mn(2+), Zn(2+), Co(2+) and Cu(2+)
      influence KYNU activity, and Mg(2+) regulates quinolinate phosphoribosyl
      transferase. Fe(2+) is responsible for the proper functioning of both indoleamine
      2,3-dioxygenase and 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid dioxygenase. Changes in the
      concentration of KP metabolites and in enzymatic activity have been found in many
      pathological states. Therefore, it is justifiable to regulate the concentration
      of certain kynurenines or enzymes in the KP which may provide a potential
      therapeutic target for the treatment of various health impairments. This review
      demonstrates the role of vitamin and mineral activity on the KP, which may have
      an effect on the proper functioning of the human organism. Surplus administration
      of vitamins did not elicit any beneficial effects on L-tryptophan metabolism.
      Whether a mineral surplus influences L-tryptophan metabolism is still not
      established. It seems that cofactor deficiencies influence the KP far more than
      surpluses.

TI  - Chili Peppers, Curcumins, and Prebiotics in Gastrointestinal Health and Disease.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1007/s11894-016-0494-0 [doi]
AB  - There is growing evidence for the role of several natural products as either
      useful agents or adjuncts in the management of functional GI disorders (FGIDs).
      In this review, we examine the medical evidence for three such compounds: chili, 
      a culinary spice; curcumin, another spice and active derivative of a root bark;
      and prebiotics, which are nondigestible food products. Chili may affect the
      pathogenesis of abdominal pain especially in functional dyspepsia and cause other
      symptoms. It may have a therapeutic role in FGIDs through desensitization of
      transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptor. Curcumin, the active
      ingredient of turmeric rhizome, has been shown in several preclinical studies and
      uncontrolled clinical trials as having effects on gut inflammation, gut
      permeability and the brain-gut axis, especially in FGIDs. Prebiotics, the
      non-digestible food ingredients in dietary fiber, may serve as nutrients and
      selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of certain colonic bacteria. The
      net effect of this change on colonic microbiota may lead to the production of
      acidic metabolites and other compounds that help to reduce the production of
      toxins and suppress the growth of harmful or disease-causing enteric pathogens.
      Although some clinical benefit in IBS has been shown, high dose intake of
      prebiotics may cause more bloating from bacterial fermentation.

TI  - The human gut microbiome and its dysfunctions through the meta-omics prism.
PG  - 9-19
LID - 10.1111/nyas.13033 [doi]
AB  - The microorganisms inhabiting the human gut are abundant (10(14) cells) and
      diverse (approximately 500 species per individual). It is now acknowledged that
      the microbiota has coevolved with its host to achieve a symbiotic relationship,
      leading to physiological homeostasis. The gut microbiota ensures vital functions,
      such as food digestibility, maturation of the host immune system, and protection 
      against pathogens. Over the last few decades, the gut microbiota has also been
      associated with numerous diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable 
      bowel syndrome, obesity, and metabolic diseases. In most of these pathologies, a 
      microbial dysbiosis has been found, indicating shifts in the taxonomic
      composition of the gut microbiota and changes in its functionality. Our
      understanding of the influence of the gut microbiota on human health is still
      growing. Working with microorganisms residing in the gut is challenging since
      most of them are anaerobic and a vast majority (approximately 75%) are
      uncultivable to date. Recently, a wide range of new approaches (meta-omics) has
      been developed to bypass the uncultivability and reveal the intricate mechanisms 
      that sustain gut microbial homeostasis. After a brief description of these
      approaches (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics),
      this review will discuss the importance of considering the gut microbiome as a
      structured ecosystem and the use of meta-omics to decipher dysfunctions of the
      gut microbiome in diseases.

TI  - Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 supplementation in the management of diarrhea
      predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a double blind randomized placebo
      controlled pilot clinical study.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s12937-016-0140-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 has been marketed as a dietary
      ingredient, but its efficacy in diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) condition has not been clinically elucidated till date. Thus, a double
      blind placebo controlled multi-centered trial was planned to evaluate the safety 
      and efficacy of B. coagulans MTCC 5856 in diarrhea predominant IBS patients.
      METHODS: Thirty six newly diagnosed diarrhea predominant IBS patients were
      enrolled in three clinical centres. Along with standard care of treatment, 18
      patients in group one received placebo while in group two 18 patients received B.
      coagulans MTCC 5856 tablet containing 2 x 10(9) cfu/day as active for 90 days.
      Clinical symptoms of IBS were considered as primary end point measures and were
      evaluated through questionnaires. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for
      abdominal pain. Physician's global assessment and IBS quality of life were
      considered as secondary efficacy measures and were monitored through
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Laboratory parameters, anthropometric and vital signs
      were within the normal clinical range during the 90 days of supplementation in
      placebo and B. coagulans MTCC 5856 group. There was a significant decrease in the
      clinical symptoms like bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and stool
      frequency in a patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856 when compared to
      placebo group (p < 0.01). Similarly, disease severity also decreased and the
      quality of life increased in the patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856
      when compared to placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that the B.
      coagulans MTCC 5856 at a dose of 2 x 10(9) cfu/day along with standard care of
      treatment was found to be safe and effective in diarrhea predominant IBS patients
      for 90 days of supplementation. Hence, B. coagulans MTCC 5856 could be a
      potential agent in the management of diarrhea predominant IBS patients.

TI  - (13) C mannitol as a novel biomarker for measurement of intestinal permeability.
PG  - 1114-9
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12802 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI disorders are associated with
      altered intestinal permeability, which can be measured in vivo by urinary
      excretion after oral lactulose and mannitol ingestion. Inadvertent dietary
      consumption of (12) Carbon ((12) C, regular) mannitol in food or from other
      sources may interfere with the test's interpretation. (13) Carbon ((13) C)
      constitutes 1% of carbon in nature and (13) C mannitol is a stable isotope. Our
      aim was to determine the performance of (13) C mannitol for measurement of
      intestinal permeability. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers underwent intestinal
      permeability assay using coadministered (12) C mannitol, (13) C mannitol and
      lactulose, followed by timed urine collections. Urinary sugar concentrations were
      measured using tandem high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
      KEY RESULTS: We found that (13) C mannitol can be distinguishable from (12) C
      mannitol on tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, (13) C mannitol had ~20-fold
      lower baseline contamination compared to (12) C mannitol. We describe here the
      (13) C mannitol assay method for the measurement of intestinal permeability.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In conclusion, (13) C mannitol is superior to (12) C
      mannitol for measurement of intestinal permeability. It avoids issues with
      baseline contamination and erratic excretions during the testing period.

TI  - Altered gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome and its
      modification by diet: probiotics, prebiotics and the low FODMAP diet.
PG  - 306-18
LID - 10.1017/S0029665116000021 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by
      abdominal pain or discomfort with disordered defecation. This review describes
      the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and
      how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community.
      Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in
      IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which
      has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials 
      suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating 
      IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated
      effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel
      method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable
      carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical
      effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one
      unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the
      microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal
      Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction
      in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has
      clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration.
      Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the 
      complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both
      interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment
      has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for
      optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects
      on the GI microbiota.

TI  - Gut microbiota role in irritable bowel syndrome: New therapeutic strategies.
PG  - 2219-41
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2219 [doi]
AB  - In the last decade the impressive expansion of our knowledge of the vast
      microbial community that resides in the human intestine, the gut microbiota, has 
      provided support to the concept that a disturbed intestinal ecology might promote
      development and maintenance of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As a
      correlate, manipulation of gut microbiota represents a new strategy for the
      treatment of this multifactorial disease. A number of attempts have been made to 
      modulate the gut bacterial composition, following the idea that expansion of
      bacterial species considered as beneficial (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria)
      associated with the reduction of those considered harmful (Clostridium,
      Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas) should attenuate IBS
      symptoms. In this conceptual framework, probiotics appear an attractive option in
      terms of both efficacy and safety, while prebiotics, synbiotics and antibiotics
      still need confirmation. Fecal transplant is an old treatment translated from the
      cure of intestinal infective pathologies that has recently gained a new life as
      therapeutic option for those patients with a disturbed gut ecosystem, but data on
      IBS are scanty and randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

AB  - Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is the most common travel-related illness, and it can
      have a significant impact on the traveler. Pretravel consultation provides an
      excellent opportunity for the clinician to counsel the traveler and discuss
      strategies such as food and water hygiene, vaccinations, and medications for
      prophylaxis or self-treatment that may decrease the incidence and impact of TD.
      Postinfectious sequelae, such as postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome,
      reactive arthritis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, may develop weeks or months
      after return.

TI  - Nickel-Related Intestinal Mucositis in IBS-Like Patients: Laser Doppler Perfusion
      Imaging and Oral Mucosa Patch Test in Use.
PG  - 55-61
LID - 10.1007/s12011-016-0650-2 [doi]
AB  - Nickel (Ni) is often the trigger of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      gastrointestinal disorders: its ingestion may cause allergic contact mucositis,
      identifiable by means of oral mucosa patch test (omPT). OmPT effectiveness has
      been proven, but it is still an operator-dependent method. Laser Doppler
      perfusion imaging (LDPI) was tested to support omPT in Ni allergic contact
      mucositis diagnosis. Group A: 22 patients with intestinal/systemic symptoms
      related to the ingestion of Ni-containing foods. Group B: 12 asymptomatic
      volunteers. Ni-related symptoms and their severity were tested by a
      questionnaire. All patients underwent Ni omPT with clinical evaluation at
      baseline (T0), after 30 min (T1), after 2 h (T2), and after 24-48 h (T3). LDPI
      was performed to evaluate the mean mucosal perfusion at T0, T1, and T2.
      Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA test and Bonferroni
      multiple-comparison test. All 22 Ni-sensitive patients (group A) presented oral
      mucosa hyperemia and/or edema at T2. Eight out of the same 22 patients presented 
      a local delayed vesicular reaction at T3 (group A1), unlike the remaining 14 out 
      of 22 patients (group A2). All 12 patients belonging to control group B did not
      show any alteration. The mean mucosal perfusion calculated with LDPI showed an
      increase in both subgroups A1 and A2. In group B, no significant perfusion
      variations were observed. LDPI may support omPT for diagnostic purposes in Ni
      allergic contact mucositis. This also applies to symptomatic Ni-sensitive
      patients without aphthous stomatitis after 24-48 h from omPT and that could risk 
      to miss the diagnosis.

      development and psychometric evaluation.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s12955-016-0423-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important outcome
      indicator for chronic disease, and particularly in the absence of biological
      markers for illness, such as with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aims of
      this study were to develop and evaluate a new IBS-specific HRQOL instrument
      (IBS-HR-QOL). METHODS: This methodological study comprised three steps:
      conceptualization of the IBS-HR-QOL, item extraction and establishment of content
      validity, and psychometric evaluation of the instrument with 267 IBS patients
      recruited from four university hospitals. RESULTS: The content validity of the
      developed IBS-HR-QOL was assessed by 11 experts. Exploratory and confirmatory
      factor analyses yielded four factors. The criterion and convergent validities of 
      the IBS-HR-QOL were demonstrated using the Short Form-36 and the Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale, respectively. Known-groups validity was demonstrated using 
      a symptom-severity scale. The internal consistency reliability and test-retest
      reliability were satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation
      coefficient of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS-HR-QOL comprises
      a total of 16 items. The IBS-HR-QOL demonstrated good psychometric properties.
      This instrument is easily comprehensible and short, rendering it feasible for use
      in clinical practice and research.

AB  - In 2015, besides the fact that it still fills the gastroenterologists' offices
      and impairs patient's quality of life, the irritable bowel syndrome has
      considerably evolved on several points. The pathophysiology is now organized
      around a consensual hypothesis called the "brain-gut axis", which gather all the 
      influences of peripheral factors as gut microbiota or local serotonin secretion, 
      on the central pain perception, contributing to visceral hypersensitivity and
      transit modifications. About the diagnosis, the key message is "avoid
      over-prescription" of additional tests, and reminds that a positive clinical
      diagnosis based on Rome III criteria is possible after the elimination of simple 
      clinical warning signs. Finally, the food component, a neglected and historical
      claim of patients, finally finds a strong scientific rational, with a diet low in
      fermentable sugar and polyols, that gives positive and reproducible results.

TI  - Evidence for the Presence of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity in Patients with
      Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Results from a Multicenter Randomized
      Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Gluten Challenge.
PG  - 84
LID - 10.3390/nu8020084 [doi]
LID - E84 [pii]
AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by the onset of symptoms
      after eating gluten-containing food. We aimed to single out NCGS subjects among
      subjects with functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients were enrolled in a
      multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Symptoms and
      quality of life were evaluated by means of 10-cm VAS and SF36. Iron parameters,
      transaminases and C reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. After a
      three-week-long gluten-free diet (GFD), responsive patients were randomly
      assigned to gluten intake (5.6 g/day) or placebo for seven days, followed by
      crossover. The primary endpoint was the worsening of symptoms (VAS increase >/=3 
      cm) during gluten ingestion compared to placebo. One hundred and forty patients
      were enrolled and 134 (17 males, mean age 39.1 +/- 11.7 years, BMI 22.4 +/- 3.8) 
      completed the first period. A total of 101 subjects (10 males, mean age 39.3 +/- 
      11.0 years, BMI 22.3 +/- 4.0) reported a symptomatic improvement (VAS score 2.3
      +/- 1.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 before and after GFD, p = 0.001). 98 patients underwent
      the gluten challenge and 28 (all females, mean age 38.9 +/- 12.7 years, BMI 22.0 
      +/- 2.9) reported a symptomatic relapse and deterioration of quality of life. No 
      parameters were found to be statistically associated with positivity to the
      challenge. However, 14 patients responded to the placebo ingestion. Taking into
      account this finding, about 14% of patients responding to gluten withdrawal
      showed a symptomatic relapse during the gluten challenge. This group is suspected
      to have NCGS.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.12 [doi]
AB  - Food sits at the intersection between gastrointestinal (GI) physiology and
      symptoms in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is now clear
      that the majority of IBS sufferers associate eating a meal with their GI and
      non-GI symptoms. This is hardly surprising when one considers that food can
      affect a variety of physiologic factors (motility, visceral sensation, brain-gut 
      interactions, microbiome, permeability, immune activation, and neuro-endocrine
      function) relevant to the pathogenesis of IBS. In recent years, clinical research
      has increasingly focused on diet as a treatment for IBS. There is a relative
      paucity of data from rigorous, randomized, controlled trials for any dietary
      intervention in IBS patients. Currently, the largest body of literature has
      addressed the efficacy of dietary restriction of fermentable oligo, di,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In the future, dietary treatments for IBS
      will move beyond the current focus on elimination to embrace supplementation with
      "functional" foods.

AB  - Mast cells are constitutively found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The three
      major physiological functions of GI mast cells comprise of - as far as we know - 
      regulation of GI functions, namely epithelial and endothelial functions,
      crosstalk with the enteric nervous system, and contribution to the host defense
      against bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. A number of chronic GI diseases,
      including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),
      celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies, are thought to be
      associated with mast cell hyperplasia and humoral activity. Clinical conditions
      characterized by a decrease in mast cell functionality are not known so far. In
      the present review, we summarize current evidence which show that human mast
      cells play a central role at the GI barrier, both in health and disease.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common, chronic relapsing gastrointestinal disorder
      that affects 7%-22% of the population worldwide. According to Rome III Criteria, 
      the disorder is defined by the coexistence of abdominal discomfort or pain
      associated with an alteration in bowel habits. Its pathophysiology is not
      completely understood but, in addition to some important abnormalities, the
      disturbed intestinal microbiota has also been described supported by several
      strands of evidence. The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome is based upon
      several therapeutic approaches but few have been successful or without adverse
      events and more recently the gut microbiota and the use of probiotics have
      emerged as a factor to be considered. Probiotics are live micro-organisms which
      when consumed in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host, such as
      Lactic bacteria among others. An important scientific rationale has emerged for
      the use of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, although the data regarding
      different species are still limited. Not all probiotics are beneficial: it is
      important to select the specific strain which should be supported by good
      evidence base. The mechanisms of action of probiotics are described and the main 
      strains are quoted.

AB  - Food is essential for life. Yet, poor food choices may cause poor health. Dietary
      manipulation is frequently integrated into the management of common chronic
      pediatric conditions. Parents seek dietary information to have more control over 
      child's condition and to avoid side effects of medicine. This article reviews
      selected diets for a few common pediatric disorders including eczema, attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, headache and migraine, non-celiac gluten
      sensitivity, and irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome an infectious disease?
PG  - 1331-4
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i4.1331 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common of all gastroenterological
      diseases. While many mechanisms have been postulated to explain its etiology, no 
      single mechanism entirely explains the heterogeneity of symptoms seen with the
      various phenotypes of the disease. Recent data from both basic and clinical
      sciences suggest that underlying infectious disease may provide a unifying
      hypothesis that better explains the overall symptomatology. The presence of small
      intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) has been documented in patients with IBS and
      reductions in SIBO as determined by breath testing correlate with IBS symptom
      improvement in clinical trials. The incidence of new onset IBS symptoms following
      acute infectious gastroenteritis also suggests an infectious cause. Alterations
      in microbiota-host interactions may compromise epithelial barrier integrity,
      immune function, and the development and function of both central and enteric
      nervous systems explaining alterations in the brain-gut axis. Clinical evidence
      from treatment trials with both probiotics and antibiotics also support this
      etiology. Probiotics appear to restore the imbalance in the microflora and
      improve IBS-specific quality of life. Antibiotic trials with both neomycin and
      rifaximin show improvement in global IBS symptoms that correlates with breath
      test normalization in diarrhea-predominant patients. The treatment response to
      two weeks of rifaximin is sustained for up to ten weeks and comparable results
      are seen in symptom reduction with retreatment in patients who develop recurrent 
      symptoms.

TI  - From coeliac disease to noncoeliac gluten sensitivity; should everyone be gluten 
      free?
PG  - 120-7
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000248 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gluten-free diets (GFDs) have seen a disproportional rise in
      use and popularity relative to the prevalence of established gluten-related
      disorders such as coeliac disease or immunoglobulin E wheat allergy. This entity 
      has been termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). This review aims to provide
      a current perspective on the emerging evidence for and against NCGS, along with
      the associated need for a GFD. RECENT FINDINGS: NCGS and the benefits of a GFD
      are reported amongst patients with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel
      disease, and nonintestinal disorders such as neuropsychiatric diseases and
      fibromyalgia. However, no reliable biomarkers currently exist to diagnose NCGS
      and hence confirmatory testing can only be performed using double-blind
      placebo-controlled gluten-based challenges. Unfortunately, such tests are not
      available in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, recent novel studies have
      highlighted the role of other gluten-based components in contributing to the
      symptoms of self-reported NCGS. These include fermentable oligo, di,
      mono-saccharides and polyols, amylase trypsin inhibitors, and wheat germ
      agglutinins. Therefore, NCGS is now seen as a spectrum encompassing several
      biological responses and terms such as 'noncoeliac wheat sensitivity' have been
      suggested as a wider label to define the condition. SUMMARY: Despite the rising
      use of a GFD further studies are required to clearly establish the extent and
      exclusivity of gluten in NCGS.

      of probiotics.
PG  - 467-75
LID - 10.2217/fmb.15.150 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are living micro-organisms that do not naturally have shelf life, and 
      normally are weakly protected against the digestive action of the GI tract. A new
      dual coating technology has been developed in an effort to maximize survival,
      that is, to be able to reach the intestine alive and in sufficient numbers to
      confer the beneficial health effects on the host. Dual-coating of lactic acid
      bacteria (LAB) is the result of fourth-generation coating technology for the
      protection of these bacteria at least 100-fold or greater than the uncoated LAB. 
      This innovative technique involves a first pH-dependent protein layer that
      protects bacteria from gastric acid and bile salt, and a second polysaccharide
      matrix that protects bacteria from external factors, such as humidity,
      temperature and pressure, as well as the digestive action during the passage
      through the GI tract. Dual-coated probiotic formulation is applicable to
      different therapeutic areas, including irritable bowel syndrome, atopic
      dermatitis, acute diarrhea, chronic constipation, Helicobacter pylori
      eradication, and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. An updated review 
      of the efficacy of doubly coated probiotic strains for improving bacterial
      survival in the intestinal tract and its consequent clinical benefits in humans
      is here presented.

      of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.

AB  - AIM: Because of increasing awareness of variations in the use of pancreatic
      exocrine replacement therapy, the Australasian Pancreatic Club decided it was
      timely to re-review the literature and create new Australasian guidelines for the
      management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). METHODS: A working party
      of expert clinicians was convened and initially determined that by dividing the
      types of presentation into three categories for the likelihood of PEI (definite, 
      possible and unlikely) they were able to consider the difficulties of diagnosing 
      PEI and relate these to the value of treatment for each diagnostic category.
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies confirm that patients with chronic
      pancreatitis receive similar benefit from pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy
      (PERT) to that established in children with cystic fibrosis. Severe acute
      pancreatitis is frequently followed by PEI and PERT should be considered for
      these patients because of their nutritional requirements. Evidence is also
      becoming stronger for the benefits of PERT in patients with unresectable
      pancreatic cancer. However there is as yet no clear guide to help identify those 
      patients in the 'unlikely' PEI group who would benefit from PERT. For example,
      patients with coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus, irritable bowel syndrome and
      weight loss in the elderly may occasionally be given a trial of PERT, but
      determining its effectiveness will be difficult. The starting dose of PERT should
      be from 25,000-40,000 IU lipase taken with food. This may need to be titrated up 
      and there may be a need for proton pump inhibitors in some patients to improve
      efficacy.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, functional bowel disorder
      characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habit. The
      pathophysiology is unclear, but may include altered gut motility, visceral
      hypersensitivity, abnormal central pain processing, chronic low-grade intestinal 
      inflammation, or disturbances in the gut microbiome. These etiological
      mechanisms, alongside environmental factors such as stress and anxiety, vary
      between individuals and represent potential targets for treatment. Rifaximin is a
      poorly absorbed oral antibiotic proposed to act on the gut microenvironment, used
      in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy. Clinical
      trials suggest the drug can reduce global IBS symptoms and improve bloating,
      abdominal pain, and stool consistency in some patients with non-constipated IBS, 
      leading to Food and Drug Administration approval in the United States. This
      article considers the pharmacology of rifaximin, the evidence for its use in IBS,
      and the safety and tolerability of the drug.

TI  - Prevalence, symptom patterns and management of episodic diarrhoea in the
      community: a population-based survey in 11 countries.
PG  - 586-95
LID - 10.1111/apt.13513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent of episodic diarrhoea in the community is relatively
      unknown. AIM: To ascertain the prevalence, symptoms and management behaviours
      associated with self-reported diarrhoea across 11 countries. METHODS: Community
      screening surveys were conducted using quota sampling of respondents to identify 
      a nationally representative sample of individuals suffering from 'episodic'
      diarrhoea (occurring once a month or more often). Second-phase in-depth surveys
      provided data on epidemiology, symptoms, attributed causes and management of
      episodic diarrhoea. RESULTS: A total of 11 508 phase 1 and 6613 phase 2 surveys
      were completed. The prevalence of self-reported episodic diarrhoea ranged from
      16% to 23% across the 11 countries. The majority of episodic diarrhoea sufferers 
      were female (57%) and were not diagnosed with pre-existing irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS); IBS diagnosis ranged from 9% in Mexico to 44% in Italy. Diarrhoea
      was frequently attributed to anxiety/stress, food-related causes,
      gastrointestinal 'sensitivity' and menstruation. Accompanying symptoms included
      'stomach pain/cramping' (35-62%), 'stomach grumbling' (29-68%) and 'wind'
      (18-74%). The proportion of episodic sufferers who reported treating their
      symptoms with remedies or medications ranged between 46% in Belgium and Canada
      and 90% in Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of the population in
      middle- to high-income countries report episodic diarrhoea in the absence of a
      pre-existing diagnosis. These symptoms are likely to be associated with
      substantial social and economic costs, and have implications on how best to
      configure and guide self-led, pharmacist-led and primary care management.

TI  - Efficacy of a Gluten-Free Diet in Subjects With Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Diarrhea
      Unaware of Their HLA-DQ2/8 Genotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A gluten-containing diet alters bowel barrier function in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), particularly those 
      who are positive for HLA allele DQ2/8. We studied the effects of a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) in patients with IBS-D who have not previously considered the effects 
      of gluten in their diet and were unaware of their HLA-DQ2/8 genotype. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective study of 41 patients with IBS-D (20 HLA-DQ2/8-positive
      and 21 HLA-DQ2/8-negative) at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, United
      Kingdom, from September 2012 through July 2015. All subjects were placed on a
      6-week GFD following evaluation by a dietician. Subjects completed validated
      questionnaires at baseline and Week 6 of the GFD. The primary endpoint was mean
      change in IBS Symptom Severity Score; a 50-point reduction was considered to
      indicate a clinical response. Secondary endpoints were changes in hospital
      anxiety and depression score, fatigue impact score, and Short Form-36 results.
      Clinical responders who chose to continue a GFD after the study period were
      evaluated on average 18 months later to assess diet durability, symptom scores,
      and anthropometric and biochemical status. RESULTS: A 6-week GFD reduced IBS
      Symptom Severity Score by >/=50 points in 29 patients overall (71%). The mean
      total IBS Symptom Severity Score decreased from 286 before the diet to 131 points
      after 6 weeks on the diet (P < .001); the reduction was similar in each HLA-DQ
      group. However, HLA-DQ2/8-negative subjects had a greater reduction in abdominal 
      distention (P = .04). Both groups had marked mean improvements in hospital
      anxiety and depression scores, fatigue impact score, and Short Form-36 results,
      although HLA-DQ2/8-positive subjects had a greater reduction in depression score 
      and increase in vitality score than HLA-DQ2/8-negative subjects (P = .02 and P = 
      .03, respectively). Twenty-one of the 29 subjects with a clinical response (72%) 
      planned to continue the GFD long term; 18 months after the study they were still 
      on a GFD, with maintained symptom reductions, and demonstrated similar
      anthropometric and biochemical features compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: A
      dietitian-led GFD provided sustained benefit to patients with IBS-D. The symptoms
      that improved differed in magnitude according to HLA-DQ status. Clinical
      trials.gov no: NCT02528929.

TI  - Microbiota - a key to healing the gastrointestinal tract?
PG  - 21-4
AB  - At present, it is already known that many gastrointestinal tract diseases are
      caused by disorders of the intestinal ecosystem. The contribution of microbiota
      disorders to the development and sustaining of inlammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, constipation or bloating has
      been demonstrated in numerous scientiic studies. Another matter is bacterial
      imbalance in food allergy and atopic diseases. The effectiveness of probiotics
      and prebiotics in these diseases has been repeatedly conirmed, which made
      researchers search for new diseases in which probiotics could be an eficient
      therapeutic solution. Reports have also been published on microbiota disturbances
      in children with a spectrum of autistic disorders, depression or metabolic
      syndrome, and in obese patients. New micro -organisms have been discovered, which
      in addition to Lactobacillus or Biidobacterium bacteria, may signiicantly
      inluence the improvement of human health. Especially promising are two bacterial 
      species, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which seem to 
      interact in continuity regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. A. muciniphila 
      has the ability to degrade mucin, while producing acetic acid, propionic acid and
      oligosaccharides. These products become the substrate for F. prausnitzii, one of 
      the main producers of butyrate in the intestine. The anaerobic butyrate
      -producing bacterium helps to inhibit inlammation in the gastrointestinal tract, 
      while preventing increased intestinal permeability. Growth stimulation in
      bacteria (e.g. towards prebiotic therapy) may therefore prove to be a valuable
      nutritional option and an eficient way to restore the intestinal epithelium.
      While A. muciniphila is extensively studied in the context of obesity and
      diabetes, F. prausnitzii may become an interesting marker for Crohn's disease
      activity. The aim of this paper is to present new and promising aspects of
      intestinal microbiota restoration in the treatment of selected diseases.

TI  - [What is the optimal diet?]
PG  - 289-293
AB  - Food intake is expected to cover our basal requirements in energy, proteins,
      minerals, vitamins, trace elements and water. As it has been already suggested by
      Hippocrates, food can play a role in preventing but also in caring some diseases.
      The type of diet has medical, mediatic, economic and cultural implications. Many 
      diets are recommended but only a few of them have been validated. The fight
      against obesity has also created a lot of diet for losing weight. This article is
      a critical review of some diet in the domain of cancer, gluten sensitivity,
      irritable bowel syndrome and therapeutic fasting.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome among nurses working in King Abdulaziz University
      Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 30866
LID - 10.3402/ljm.v11.30866 [doi]
AB  - Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal 
      disorder that can cause disability and economic burden. Nurses are a vital part
      of the medical team and their well-being is an important issue. Yet, few studies 
      have been done concerning IBS among nurses. Objectives To determine the
      prevalence, severity, and predictors of IBS among nurses working at King
      Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods A
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 229 nurses who fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria. They were selected by stratified random sampling during
      2014-2015. A validated, confidential, self-administered data collection sheet was
      used for collection of personal and sociodemographic data. Rome III Criteria, IBS
      Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 
      and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were included. Both descriptive and
      inferential statistics were done. A multiple logistic regression analysis was
      done to determine the predictors of IBS. Results The prevalence of IBS among
      nurses was 14.4%, and IBS-Mixed type was the commonest variety (54.5%). Positive 
      family history of IBS, working in outpatient clinics, having day shift, poor
      sleep quality, and high anxiety and depression scale scores were significantly
      associated with IBS. After controlling for confounding factors in regression
      analysis, the predictors of IBS were food hypersensitivity (aOR=4.52; 95% CI:
      1.80-11.33), morbid anxiety (aOR=4.34; 95% CI: 1.49-12.67), and positive family
      history of IBS (aOR=3.38; 95% CI: 1.12-13.23). Conclusion The prevalence of IBS
      was 14.4%. Food hypersensitivity, morbid anxiety, and family history were the
      predictors of IBS. Screening and management of IBS, food hypersensitivity, and
      psychological problems among nurses are recommended.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated differences in the intestinal microbiota between
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy controls (HC),
      suggesting a role for the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS.
      Alterations in the microbiota have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      abdominal bloating, a commonly reported symptom in IBS. We investigated the
      relationship between the intestinal microbiota, abdominal bloating, and altered
      bowel patterns in a cohort of patients with IBS and HC. The 16S rRNA gene from
      fresh fecal samples was amplified and pyrosequenced by using Roche-454 Titanium
      chemistry. A Core Measurable Microbiome (CMM) was generated for Operational
      Taxonomic Unit (OTU) detected in >75% of all samples and compositional features
      of CMM were compared between groups by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). IBS
      differentiated from HC by LDA using continuous variation in the species/OTUs or
      the CMM genera. When subcategorized based on bloating symptoms and bowel
      characteristics, the same subjects were also well differentiated from one another
      and from HC. ANOVA analysis showed quantitative species/OTU differences between
      the subgroups including IBS with and without bloating, and subtypes based on
      bowel characteristics. The clear LDA differentiation and the significant
      microbial taxa differences between the groups imply a significant association of 
      the microbiota with bloating symptoms and bowel characteristics in IBS. These
      changes in the microbiota may serve as a biomarker for IBS and its clinical
      subtypes and suggest a role for the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of 
      the main symptoms of the disorder.

TI  - The Overlap between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A
      Clinical Dilemma.
PG  - 10417-26
LID - 10.3390/nu7125541 [doi]
AB  - The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes
      celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of 
      symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or
      abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they 
      can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are 
      diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain
      asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for
      the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of 
      symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a
      dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from
      the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a
      gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both
      can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common
      pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well
      understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors
      such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function 
      and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal
      role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported
      to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the
      source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.

TI  - Comorbidities, Concomitant Medications, and Diet as Factors Affecting
      Levothyroxine Therapy: Results of the CONTROL Surveillance Project.
PG  - 53-68
LID - 10.1007/s40268-015-0116-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The CONTROL Surveillance Project was a comprehensive patient-based
      survey conducted among hypothyroid patients undergoing treatment. The primary
      objective of the study was to specifically quantify the prevalence of factors
      adversely affecting levothyroxine therapy. METHODS: Participants were selected
      from a large proprietary database. Those eligible for the study completed a
      21-question survey. RESULTS: Of the eligible hypothyroid patients, 925 (92.5%)
      were being treated with levothyroxine monotherapy. The mean age was 60.4 years;
      755 (81.6%) were female and 168 (18.2%) were male. Almost half of those receiving
      levothyroxine (435, 47.0%) had at least one comorbid condition that could
      adversely affect its absorption: gastroesophageal reflux disease (33.8% of
      patients), irritable bowel syndrome (9.7%), lactose intolerance (7.8%), or a
      history of gastric bypass surgery or bowel resection (3.0%). Other factors
      reported by many patients that could adversely affect levothyroxine absorption
      included use of prescription medications (20.6%) and over-the-counter medications
      (34.3%) used to treat comorbid gastrointestinal (GI) conditions; use of dietary
      supplements (51.8%, primarily calcium and iron); and intake of foods/beverages
      high in fiber, iodine, or soy (68.0%). Of the 13.4% who reported difficulty
      controlling their hypothyroid symptoms, significantly more patients with comorbid
      GI conditions reported such difficulty (7.8 versus 5.6%, P < 0.01). Frequent
      changes in levothyroxine dosing (two or more dose changes in the past year) were 
      reported by 8.0% of survey participants. Those with GI comorbidities were nearly 
      twice as likely to have such changes (5.0 versus 3.0%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:
      Better initial workup of patients, including identification of relevant GI
      comorbidities and allergies, may help in the early detection of factors that may 
      affect the performance of levothyroxine.

TI  - Prevalence and Predictive Factors of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in a
      Community-dwelling Population in Japan.
PG  - 3105-12
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.5378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal
      disorder characterized by chronic, relapsing abdominal pain or discomfort and is 
      associated with disturbed defecation. The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III
      criteria and to assess the effects of mental and lifestyle factors on IBS in a
      community-dwelling population in Japan. METHODS: The diagnosis of irritable bowel
      syndrome was based on the Japanese version of the Rome III Questionnaire. The
      questionnaire was administered to 993 volunteers who participated in the Iwaki
      Health Promotion Project 2013. Diet was assessed with a validated brief-type
      self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns based on 52
      predefined food groups [energy-adjusted food (g/d)] were extracted using a
      principal component analysis. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
      Scale with a cut-off point of 16 was used to assess the prevalence of depression.
      RESULTS: A total of 61 subjects (6.1%) were classified as having IBS. Three
      dietary patterns were identified: "Healthy", "Western" and "Alcohol and
      accompanying" dietary patterns. After adjusting for potential confounders, the
      "Alcohol and accompanying" dietary pattern and depression were related to the
      risk of IBS. CONCLUSION: We found that an "Alcohol and accompanying" dietary
      pattern and depression were related to the risk of IBS in a Japanese community
      population. However, we could not rule out the possibility of some selection
      bias. Further studies with longitudinal observations are therefore warranted.

PG  - 205-11
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-3252-8_22 [doi]
AB  - Menthol, a monoterpene, is a principal component of peppermint oil and is used
      extensively in consumer products as a flavoring aid. It is also commonly used
      medicinally as a topical skin coolant; to treat inflammation of the mucous
      membranes, digestive problems, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); and in
      preventing spasms during endoscopy and for its spasmolytic effect on the smooth
      muscle of the gastrointestinal tract. Menthol has a half life of 3-6 h and is
      rapidly metabolized to menthol glucuronide which is detectable in urine and serum
      following menthol use. We describe a method for the determination of total
      menthol in human plasma and urine using liquid/liquid extraction, gas
      chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in selected ion monitoring mode and
      menthol-d4 as the internal standard. Controls are prepared with menthol
      glucuronide and all samples undergo enzymatic hydrolysis for the quantification
      of total menthol. The method has a linear range of 5-1000 ng/mL, and coefficient 
      of variation <10%.

TI  - Probiotics in digestive diseases: focus on Lactobacillus GG.
PG  - 273-92
AB  - Probiotics are becoming increasingly important in basic and clinical research,
      but they are also a subject of considerable economic interest due to their
      expanding popularity. They are live micro-organisms which, when administered in
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. From this very well-known 
      definition, it is clear that, unlike drugs, probiotics might be useful in healthy
      subjects to reduce the risk of developing certain diseases or to optimise some
      physiological functions. They also may offer some advantages in already ill
      persons in relieving symptoms and signs, e.g. people with acute diarrhea.
      According to current definitions, probiotics should survive both gastric acid and
      bile to reach the small intestine and colon, where they exert their effects. Many
      of these are available in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) pill form, though some are
      available in yogurt or as packets (sachets), which can be mixed into
      non-carbonated drinks. The present review focuses on three main issues: 1)
      understanding why, at present, probiotics are so interesting for doctors and
      consumers; 2) reviewing the available data on probiotic use in digestive
      diseases, in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), (prevention of)
      infectious diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD), and colorectal cancer (CRC); 3) highlighting the individual
      profile of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the above contexts, providing an assessment 
      as well as recommendations on its use in gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) disorders.
      Research studies conducted in animals and humans with the main probiotics strains
      for GIT diseases, and published from the early 1990s to 2014 have been
      considered. PubMed, Medline and Ovid were the main sources adopted for data
      retrieving. The increasing attention on probiotics is a direct consequence of the
      improvement in the techniques for studying microbiota. Until recently, its
      composition has been analysed by culture-based methods that use differential
      media to select for specific populations of bacteria according to their metabolic
      requirements. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are by and large the most
      commonly used probiotics. Strictly speaking, however, the term "probiotic" should
      be reserved for live microbes that have been shown in controlled human studies to
      provide a health benefit. Taking into account patients suffering from the most
      common gastrointestinal diseases, in whose establishment the GI microbiota plays 
      a key role, probiotics have to be considered as very promising agents, capable of
      beneficially modulating the intestinal ecosystem, which is perturbed in cases of 
      dysbiosis. Although more clinical data are still needed to better assess the
      clinical relevance of probiotics, to date, procariota such as Bifidobacteria and 
      Lactobacilli strains, and eucariota such as some Saccharomyces strains are among 
      the most widely used agents in GIT disorders. LGG is a well-known probiotic
      strain that was isolated more than 20 years ago by Goldin and Gorbach from a
      faecal sample of a healthy adult, based on several selection criteria: high
      adhesion in vitro, high resistance against gastric acidity and high antimicrobial
      activity against pathogens such as Salmonella. In vivo studies have also shown a 
      good persistence of LGG in the human GIT. Since its isolation, LGG has become one
      of the best clinically documented probiotic strains. A growing body of evidence
      suggests benefits such as prevention and relief of various types of diarrhoea,
      and treatment of relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis. Thus, with respect to
      both adaptation to the GIT and probiotic effects, LGG can be regarded as a
      prototypical probiotic strain.

TI  - Can Probiotics Cure Inflammatory Bowel Diseases?
PG  - 904-17
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, especially microbial dysbiosis play role in
      several GI ailments such as irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer,
      inflammatory bowel diseases, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Role of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial as it involves loss of
      maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, increased release of
      pro-inflammatory molecules, and microbial dysbiosis in gut microflora. Some
      specific pathogens also play a key role in the IBD development. The origin and
      causation are still in unfathomable condition and the exact root cause is
      unknown. Recently probiotic studies have been gaining importance because of their
      positive responses in their IBD experimental results. According to joint Food and
      Agricultural Organisation/World Health Organisation working group, probiotics are
      defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amount confer 
      health benefit on the host. These live beneficial microorganisms are considered
      helpful in improving gut colonization and perseverance thereby improves
      prophylactic effect. In the direction of IBD research, a number of studies are
      needed to standardize its methodology and its applicability on human usage. The
      particular review presents an overview of gut microflora and its impact on host
      health, types of IBD and existing therapies to treat this disorder, mechanism of 
      several probiotic actions, role of probiotics in IBD prevention with their
      supporting evidences.

      irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea.
PG  - 37-49
LID - 10.1111/apt.13437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) is supported by various lines of evidence, including differences
      in mucosal and faecal microbiota between patients with IBS and healthy
      individuals, development of post-infectious IBS, and the efficacy of some
      probiotics and nonsystemic antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin). AIM: To review the
      literature regarding the role of rifaximin in IBS and its potential mechanism(s) 
      of action. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the terms
      'rifaximin', 'irritable bowel syndrome' and 'mechanism of action'. RESULTS:
      Rifaximin was approved in 2015 for the treatment of IBS with diarrhoea. In
      contrast to other currently available IBS therapies that require daily
      administration to maintain efficacy, 2-week rifaximin treatment achieved symptom 
      improvement that persisted >/=12 weeks post-treatment. The mechanisms of action
      of rifaximin, therefore, may extend beyond direct bactericidal effects. Data
      suggest that rifaximin may decrease host proinflammatory responses to bacterial
      products in patients with IBS. In some cases, small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) may play a role in the clinical symptoms of IBS. Because of the
      high level of solubility of rifaximin in the small intestine, rifaximin may reset
      microbial diversity in this environment. Consistent with this hypothesis,
      rifaximin has antibiotic efficacy against isolates derived from patients with
      SIBO. CONCLUSION: Resetting microbial diversity via rifaximin use may lead to a
      decrease in bacterial fermentation and a reduction in the clinical symptoms of
      IBS.

TI  - Gluten Sensitivity.
PG  - 16-26
LID - 10.1159/000440990 [doi]
AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal
      and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food
      in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy
      (WA). The prevalence of NCGS is not clearly defined yet. Indirect evidence
      suggests that NCGS is slightly more common than CD, the latter affecting around
      1% of the general population. NCGS has been mostly described in adults,
      particularly in females in the age group of 30-50 years; however, pediatric case 
      series have also been reported. Since NCGS may be transient, gluten tolerance
      needs to be reassessed over time in patients with NCGS. NCGS is characterized by 
      symptoms that usually occur soon after gluten ingestion, disappear with gluten
      withdrawal, and relapse following gluten challenge within hours/days. The
      'classical' presentation of NCGS is a combination of irritable bowel
      syndrome-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit
      abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), and systemic manifestations such
      as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, and anemia. In recent years,
      several studies explored the relationship between the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food and the appearance of neurological and psychiatric
      disorders/symptoms like ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia, autism,
      depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (so-called gluten psychosis). The
      diagnosis of NCGS should be considered in patients with persistent intestinal
      and/or extraintestinal complaints showing a normal result of the CD and WA
      serological markers on a gluten-containing diet, usually reporting worsening of
      symptoms after eating gluten-rich food. NCGS should not be an exclusion diagnosis
      only. Unfortunately, no biomarker is sensitive and specific enough for diagnostic
      purposes; therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS is currently based on establishing a
      clear-cut cause-effect relationship between the ingestion of gluten and the
      appearance of symptoms by a standardized double-blind, placebo-controlled gluten 
      challenge.

PG  - 175-81
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the large intestinal endocrine cell types
      affected following dietary guidance in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study included 13 IBS patients and 13 control
      subjects. The patients received three sessions of individualized dietary
      guidance. Both the control subjects and the patients were scheduled for
      colonoscopies at baseline and again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary 
      guidance. Biopsy samples were taken from the colon and rectum and were
      immunostained for all types of large intestinal endocrine cells. The endocrine
      cells were quantified using computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The daily total
      consumption (mean+/-s.e.m. values) of fruits and vegetables rich in FODMAPs
      (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols)
      decreased significantly from 16.2+/-5.3 g before receiving dietary guidance to
      9.2+/-3.2 g after receiving dietary guidance (P=0.02). In the total colon, the
      densities of serotonin cells were 46.8+/-8.9, 10.5+/-2.1 and 22.6+/-3.2
      cells/mm(2) in control subjects and in IBS patients before and after receiving
      dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.007); the corresponding densities of peptide 
      YY cells were 11.6+/-1.8, 10.8+/-1.7 and 16.8+/-2.1 cells/mm(2), respectively
      (P=0.06). The cell densities for both serotonin and peptide YY did not change
      significantly in the rectum. The densities of somatostatin cells in the rectum
      were 13.5+/-3.0, 13.2+/-3.0, and 22.3+/-3.2 cells/mm(2) for control subjects and 
      for IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively
      (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The densities of the large intestinal endocrine cells tend
      to normalize following dietary guidance that may have contributed to the
      improvement of the patients with IBS symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have increased
      postprandial symptom responses and more psychosocial morbidities than healthy
      individuals. However, the relationship between psychosocial status and
      postprandial symptom responses in patients with IBS is unclear. We investigated
      this relationship in a prospective study of patients with IBS. METHODS: A total
      of 193 IBS patients, diagnosed according to Rome II (n = 126) or Rome III (n =
      67) criteria, consumed a standard breakfast (540 kcal: 36% fat, 15% proteins, 49%
      carbohydrates, and 8.9 g fiber). They completed visual analogue scales assessing 
      the severity of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, nausea,
      gas, and fullness) before breakfast and every 30 minutes, up to 240 minutes after
      eating. All patients completed validated self-report questionnaires for their
      current levels of anxiety and depression; patients diagnosed based on Rome II
      criteria also completed a somatization questionnaire. The relationship between
      these variables and the course of gastrointestinal symptom scores over time was
      analyzed using linear mixed models, controlling for comorbid functional
      dyspepsia. RESULTS: We observed a main effect of anxiety levels on fullness and
      bloating (P < .04), and of depression levels on abdominal pain (P = .007),
      reflecting a general upward shift of the entire symptom curve. Depression-by-time
      interactions were seen for nausea and gas (P < .03). Somatization levels had a
      main effect on all 5 symptoms (P < .0001), independent of anxiety and depression.
      We observed somatization-by-time interaction effects for bloating (P = .005), and
      nausea (P = .02), and a nonsignificant trend was found for pain (P = .054),
      reflecting a steeper early postprandial increase in symptoms among subjects with 
      higher levels of somatization. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a prospective study of
      patients with IBS, psychosocial morbidities are associated with increased levels 
      of gastrointestinal symptoms in general. Depression and somatization levels are
      associated specifically with increased postprandial symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in Patients with Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome: a Double Blind Placebo-controlled Randomized Trial.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - AIM: to evaluate potential improvement effect for probiotic E. coliNissle 1917 in
      the management of refractory IBS in an Iranian population. METHODS: a double
      blind placebo controlled approach has been used in the current clinical trial.
      139 confirmed IBS patients were included into the study, and were given probiotic
      E.coli Nissle 1917 for 6 weeks. 11 items Birmingham IBS Symptom Questionnairehas 
      been used for evaluation of changes in the symptoms every 2 weeks. RESULTS: sixty
      eight subjects (49%) were males. Mean+/-SD age of the participants was 38+/-13.3 
      years. 49(35.3%) of the patients were diarrhea-predominant. The total scores
      showed no significant difference between the intervention vs. control
      group(-6.7+/-6.8 vs. -6.7+/-6.5, respectively; p=0.95); neither did any of the
      questionnaire items any significant alterations in the two groups. After
      stratification of patients based on their IBS type, diarrhea-predominant patients
      showed a positive response to the probiotic improving their sleep (p=0.05 and
      0.03 at weeks 2 and 6, respectively). Patients with constipation-predominant IBS 
      showed no response to the probiotic; while patients with diarrhea-constipation
      mixed IBS showed unfavorable response to the probiotic in the need for strain to 
      pass a motion compared to the placebo (p=0.03 and 0.02 at weeks 4 and 6,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: probiotic therapy with E.coli Nissle 1917 was not able
      to induce significant improvement in the symptoms of patients with
      non-categorized IBS. Nevertheless, when IBS patients were recategorized to
      subgroups according to their main symptoms, evaluation of the efficacy of the
      probiotic on some individual items in the symptom list reached the significance
      level. Prospective clinical trials are recommended to confirm our findings.

TI  - Perceived food intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome in a population 3 years
      after a giardiasis-outbreak: a historical cohort study.
PG  - 164
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0393-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an increased prevalence of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) after acute gastroenteritis. Food as a precipitating and
      perpetuating factor in IBS has gained recent interest, but food intolerance
      following gastroenteritis is less investigated. The aims of this study were
      firstly, to compare perceived food intolerance in a group previously exposed to
      Giardia lamblia with a control group; secondly, to explore the relation with IBS 
      status; and thirdly, to investigate associations with content of fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) in foods
      reported. METHODS: This is a historical cohort study with mailed questionnaire to
      1252 Giardia exposed and a control cohort matched by gender and age. Differences 
      between groups were investigated using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
      RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate in the exposed group was 65.3 %
      (817/1252) and in the control group 31.4 % (1128/3598). The adjusted odds ratio
      (OR) for perceived food intolerance for the exposed group was 2.00 with 95 %
      confidence interval (CI): 1.65 to 2.42, as compared with the control group.
      Perceived intolerance for dairy products was the most frequently reported
      intolerance, with an adjusted OR for the exposed of 1.95 (95 % CI: 1.51 to 2.51).
      Perceived intolerance for fatty foods, vegetables, fruit, cereals and alcohol was
      also significantly higher in the exposed group. The groups did not differ in
      perceived intolerance to spicy foods, coffee or soda. The association between
      exposure to Giardia infection and perceived food intolerance differed between the
      IBS group and the no-IBS group, but IBS was not a significant effect modifier for
      the association. Perceived intolerance for high FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.91)
      and low FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.55) was significantly associated with
      exposure status. CONCLUSION: Exposure to Giardia infection was associated with
      perceived food intolerance 3 years after giardiasis. IBS status did not alter the
      association between exposure status and perceived food intolerance. Perceived
      intolerance to high FODMAP foods and low FODMAP foods were both statistically
      significantly associated with exposure to Giardia infection.

TI  - The joint power of sex and stress to modulate brain-gut-microbiota axis and
      intestinal barrier homeostasis: implications for irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 463-86
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12717 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal homeostasis is a dynamic process that takes place at the
      interface between the lumen and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, where a
      constant scrutiny for antigens and toxins derived from food and microorganisms is
      carried out by the vast gut-associated immune system. Intestinal homeostasis is
      preserved by the ability of the mucus layer and the mucosal barrier to keep the
      passage of small-sized and antigenic molecules across the epithelium highly
      selective. When combined and preserved, immune surveillance and barrier's
      selective permeability, the host capacity of preventing the development of
      intestinal inflammation is optimized, and viceversa. In addition, the
      brain-gut-microbiome axis, a multidirectional communication system that
      integrates distant and local regulatory networks through neural, immunological,
      metabolic, and hormonal signaling pathways, also regulates intestinal function.
      Dysfunction of the brain-gut-microbiome axis may induce the loss of gut mucosal
      homeostasis, leading to uncontrolled permeation of toxins and immunogenic
      particles, increasing the risk of appearance of intestinal inflammation, mucosal 
      damage, and gut disorders. Irritable bowel syndrome is prevalent stress-sensitive
      gastrointestinal disorder that shows a female predominance. Interestingly, the
      role of stress, sex and gonadal hormones in the regulation of intestinal mucosal 
      and the brain-gut-microbiome axis functioning is being increasingly recognized.
      PURPOSE: We aim to critically review the evidence linking sex, and stress to
      intestinal barrier and brain-gut-microbiome axis dysfunction and the implications
      for irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium,
      held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects 
      of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and
      inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology.
      Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on
      probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on
      probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases,
      the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects
      of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on 
      probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as
      well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet.
      Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including
      immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory
      properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between
      periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing,
      and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on 
      a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on
      the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic
      categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.

AB  - Probiotics are foods or products that contain live microorganisms that benefit
      the host when administered. In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature
      associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, 
      focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis,
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized
      controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also
      suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an 
      adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed
      babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these
      findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for
      the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's
      disease.

PG  - 1683-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-106311 [doi]
AB  - Non-celiac non-wheat allergy wheat sensitivity is regarded as discrete
      glutensensitivity diagnosed after the exclusion of celiac disease and wheat
      allergy. Due to the absence of reliable biomarkers no exact prevalence rates are 
      known and estimations range between 0,5-6 %. Soon after ingestion of wheat,
      patients complain of intestinal symptoms mainly bloating, abdominal pain,
      diarrhea or nausea which improve fast under glutenfree diet. Often
      extraintestinal manifestation as tiredness, muscle or joint pain, headache and
      depression are reported. Actually, there are no serological markers and no
      intestinal mucosal damage was found in patients. The underlying mechanism of the 
      disease is completely unknown and beside of gluten other wheat proteins as well
      as amylase-trypsin-inhibitor or short chain sugars are discussed as triggers. In 
      addition, the involvement of the intestinal microbiome in pathology of
      glutensensitivity must be considered.

TI  - Low-FODMAP formula improves diarrhea and nutritional status in hospitalized
      patients receiving enteral nutrition: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind
      clinical trial.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0106-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) are poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates that play an
      important role in inducing functional gut symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet improves
      abdominal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable
      bowel syndrome. However, there were no study for the effect of FODMAP content on 
      gastrointestinal intolerance and nutritional status in patients receiving enteral
      nutrition (EN). METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 14-day
      clinical trial, eligible hospitalized patients receiving EN (n = 100) were
      randomly assigned to three groups; 84 patients completed the trial (low-FODMAP
      EN, n = 30; moderate-FODMAP EN, n = 28; high-FODMAP EN, n = 26). Anthropometric
      and biochemical parameters were measured; stool assessment was performed using
      the King's Stool Chart and clinical definition. RESULTS: Baseline values were not
      significantly different among the three groups. After the 14-day intervention,
      diarrhea significantly improved in the low-FODMAP group than in the moderate- and
      high-FODMAP groups (P < 0.05). King's Stool scores in diarrhea subjects were
      significantly and steadily reduced in the low-FODMAP group compared with the
      other two groups (P for time and EN type interaction <0.05). BMI increased
      significantly in the low- and high-FODMAP groups during the intervention (P <
      0.05 for both), and showed a trend toward increasing in the moderate-FODMAP group
      (P < 0.10). Serum prealbumin increased significantly in all groups by 14-day; by 
      3-day, it had increased to the levels at 14-day in the low-FODMAP group. At
      14-day, serum transferrin had increased significantly in the moderate-FODMAP
      group. In addition, subjects were classified by final condition (unimproved,
      normal maintenance, diarrhea only improved, constipation only improved, and
      recurrent diarrhea/constipation improved). Seventy-five percent of the diarrhea
      improved group consumed the low-FODMAP EN formula. 38.5 and 46.2% of recurrent
      diarrhea/constipation improved group consumed the low- and moderate-FODMAP EN
      respectively. BMI significantly increased in all groups except the unimproved.
      Prealbumin levels significantly increased in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent 
      diarrhea/constipation groups at 3-day and continued by 14-day, and in the
      constipation-improved group at 14-day. Transferrin levels significantly increased
      in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent diarrhea/constipation groups at 14-day.
      CONCLUSION: Low-FODMAP EN may improve diarrhea, leading to improved nutritional
      status and facilitating prompt recovery from illness.

TI  - Review article: insights into colonic protein fermentation, its modulation and
      potential health implications.
PG  - 181-96
LID - 10.1111/apt.13456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal
      health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful
      metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. 
      AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of
      colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for
      dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and
      pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation',
      'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate
      fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate
      diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and
      pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production 
      and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These
      metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal 
      inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and
      intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein
      intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and
      nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically,
      aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical
      importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein
      fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative
      colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake
      have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further
      clinical studies.

TI  - Aspects of the non-pharmacological treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed
      gastrointestinal conditions. It represents a significant healthcare burden and
      remains a clinical challenge. Over the years IBS has been described from a
      variety of different perspectives; from a strict illness of the gastrointestinal 
      tract (medical model) to a more complex multi-symptomatic disorder of the
      brain-gut axis (biopsychosocial/psychosomatic model). In this article we present 
      aspects of the pathophysiology and the non-pharmacological treatment of IBS based
      on current knowledge. Effects of conditioned stress and/or traumatic influences
      on the emotional system (top-down) as well as effects on the intestine through
      stressors, infection, inflammation, food and dysbiosis (bottom-up) can affect
      brain-gut communication and result in dysregulation of the autonomic nervous
      system (ANS), playing an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS.
      Conditioned stress together with dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system
      and the emotional system may involve reactions in which the distress inside the
      body is not recognized due to low body awareness. This may explain why patients
      have difficulty identifying their symptoms despite dysfunction in muscle tension,
      movement patterns, and posture and biochemical functions in addition to
      gastrointestinal symptoms. IBS shares many features with other idiopathic
      conditions, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and somatoform
      disorders. The key to effective treatment is a thorough examination, including a 
      gastroenterological examination to exclude other diseases along with an
      assessment of body awareness by a body-mind therapist. The literature suggests
      that early interdisciplinary diagnostic co-operation between gastroenterologists 
      and body-mind therapists is necessary. Re-establishing balance in the ANS is an
      important component of IBS treatment. This article discusses the current
      knowledge of body-mind treatment, addressing the topic from a practical point of 
      view.

AB  - This article discusses the most interesting studies on functional and motor
      gastrointestinal disorders presented at Digestive Diseases Week (DDW), 2015.
      Researchers are still seeking biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome and have
      presented new data. One study confirmed that the use of low-dose antidepressants 
      has an antinociceptive effect without altering the psychological features of
      patients with functional dyspepsia. A contribution that could have immediate
      application is the use of transcutaneous electroacupuncture, which has
      demonstrated effectiveness in controlling nausea in patients with gastroparesis. 
      New data have come to light on the importance of diet in irritable bowel
      syndrome, although the effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet seems to be losing
      momentum with time. Multiple data were presented on the long-term efficacy of
      rifaximin therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhoea. In
      addition, among other contributions, and more as a curiosity, a study evaluated
      the effect of histamine in the diet of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Probiotics are viable microorganisms with the capacity to alter the
      gastrointestinal microbiota of the host. The recent scientific advancements and
      development of probiotic formulations have rekindled the importance of these
      clinical interpretations, underlining the starring role of the gut flora in host 
      metabolism, defense and immune regulation. Despite encouraging preliminary
      results from randomized clinical trials of probiotics for various clinical
      conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, infantile colic, and improvement
      of digestion and immune function, further evidence is needed to determine the
      reproducibility of the findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In this 
      review, we have considered the postnatal development of gut flora and appraised
      the role of probiotics in health and disease condition among infants.

TI  - Gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders in patients with eating disorders.
PG  - 255-63
LID - 10.1007/s12328-015-0611-x [doi]
AB  - The two most clinically serious eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia
      nervosa. A drive for thinness and fear of fatness lead patients with anorexia
      nervosa either to restrict their food intake or binge-eat then purge (through
      self-induced vomiting and/or laxative abuse) to reduce their body weight to much 
      less than the normal range. A drive for thinness leads patients with bulimia
      nervosa to binge-eat then purge but fail to reduce their body weight. Patients
      with eating disorders present with various gastrointestinal disturbances such as 
      postprandial fullness, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, gastric distension, 
      and early satiety, with altered esophageal motility sometimes seen in patients
      with anorexia nervosa. Other common conditions noted in patients with eating
      disorders are postprandial distress syndrome, superior mesenteric artery
      syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and functional constipation. Binge eating may
      cause acute gastric dilatation and gastric perforation, while self-induced
      vomiting can lead to dental caries, salivary gland enlargement, gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease, and electrolyte imbalance. Laxative abuse can cause dehydration
      and electrolyte imbalance. Vomiting and/or laxative abuse can cause hypokalemia, 
      which carries a risk of fatal arrhythmia. Careful assessment and intensive
      treatment of patients with eating disorders is needed because gastrointestinal
      symptoms/disorders can progress to a critical condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Meta-analyses point to a modest but significant effect of
      probiotics on symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to assess the 
      effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on symptoms and quality
      of life in IBS patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      intervention study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IBS patients (Rome II) between 18 and 
      65 years of age were included. The study consisted of an 8-week intervention
      period in which the participants received probiotic (LcS) or placebo twice daily,
      followed by an 8-week follow-up period. Symptom diaries and quality of life were 
      scored at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The primary outcome parameter was a decrease of at
      least 30% in a composite mean symptom score (MSS) at week 8 on the basis of an
      intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-nine individuals (67% women) were
      included in the probiotic group and 41 individuals (71% women) were included in
      the placebo group. After the intervention period, the mean relative improvement
      did not reach 30% for MSS or any individual symptom score. After follow-up (week 
      16), a mean improvement of at least 30% was achieved for MSS in the probiotic
      group, but no significant difference was found between both treatment groups
      (mean+/-SD: 34+/-7%; 13+/-8%, P=0.06). CONCLUSION: After probiotic treatment with
      LcS, no improvement of 30% in MSS was observed after 8 weeks.

TI  - Quantitative Risk-Benefit Analysis of Probiotic Use for Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1007/s40264-015-0349-x [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have seen widespread use for a variety of gastrointestinal problems,
      especially in two common disorders: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory
      bowel disease. Since a wide variety of probiotic preparations has been used, and 
      despite a large number of studies performed, a great deal of heterogeneity exists
      among them. Straightforward evidence-based recommendations for the use of
      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease have thus
      been difficult to formulate. In an effort to improve understanding of the
      risk-benefit balance of probiotics in these conditions, this study (1) queried
      the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for all reported
      adverse drug events related to probiotics in 2013, and (2) constructed
      risk-benefit planes for both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease using a geometric approximation of the confidence region between risk and
      benefit. The results show that adverse events from probiotics vary widely by
      disease, and when they occur, they are mild and may be difficult to distinguish
      from the natural history of the underlying disorders they are used to treat. The 
      risk-benefit plane for irritable bowel syndrome straddles the risk-benefit
      threshold, so patients can expect a balance between a low chance of risk and also
      a low chance of benefit. The risk-benefit plane for inflammatory bowel disease
      largely lies above the risk-benefit threshold, so patients may expect more
      benefit than risk in most cases. More standardized and high-quality research is
      needed to improve our understanding of risk and benefit for these complex
      biopharmaceuticals.

TI  - Practical management of irritable bowel syndrome: a clinical review.
PG  - 30-48
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder,
      frequently managed by general practitioners and gastroenterologists. It is a
      complex condition, characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with 
      altered bowel habits, and it affects 11% of the population worldwide. It has a
      profound effect on quality of life for many patients and poses a substantial cost
      to society. Due to the complexity and diversity of IBS, diagnosis and treatment
      can be challenging. Common drawbacks in diagnosing and treating this disorder
      include unnecessary tests, failure to establish trust in the physician-patient
      relationship and difficulties in explaining the diagnosis. Research in recent
      years has however refined the diagnostic criteria and improved our ability to
      safely identify IBS with a limited number of investigations. A concise diagnostic
      evaluation, guided adequate information, prompt initiation of symptom-guided
      treatment and consistency in the patient-doctor relationship can help relieve the
      suffering experienced by patients with IBS. For patients with mild symptoms,
      reassurance, education, lifestyle changes and dietary advice are often
      sufficient. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms might need symptom
      modifying drugs, and psychological treatments such as CBT or hypnotherapy may be 
      offered at this stage. For patients with severe and incapacitating symptoms, a
      multidisciplinary approach is recommended and psychotropic drugs are often used. 
      This clinical review offers suggestions for a diagnostic approach as well as a
      treatment strategy, based on the current evidence on pathophysiology, diagnosis
      and treatment in IBS.

PG  - S60-4
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000348 [doi]
AB  - Although probiotics have been used for many years by those who suffer from what
      would now be defined as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a scientific rationale
      for their use in this indication and clinical evidence to support their benefits 
      have only emerged very recently. Evidence to support considering strategies, such
      as probiotics, that modulate the gut microbiome, in IBS, has been provided by
      laboratory studies implicating the microbiome and the host response to the
      enteric microenvironment in IBS, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies
      demonstrating the ability of various commensal bacteria to influence such
      relevant functions as motility, visceral sensation, gut barrier integrity, and
      brain-gut interactions. Clinical studies supporting a role for probiotics in the 
      management of IBS predated such experimental data, and randomized controlled
      trials of probiotics in IBS continue to be reported. Their interpretation is
      hampered by the less than optimal quality of many studies; nevertheless, it is
      apparent that probiotics, as a category, do exert significant effects in IBS.
      Defining the optimal strain, dose, formulation, and duration of therapy is more
      challenging given the limitations of available data. There is also an urgent need
      for appropriately powered and rigorously designed clinical trials of appropriate 
      duration of probiotics in IBS; such studies should also help to define those who 
      are most likely to respond to probiotics. Future laboratory and translational
      research should attempt to define the mechanism(s) of action of probiotics in IBS
      and explore the response to bacterial components or products in this common and
      oftentimes troublesome disorder.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent and the best studied
      functional gastrointestinal disorder. The etiology and the pathogenesis of IBS
      are still not clear; however, recent studies have implicated a role for
      alterations in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) in the pathophysiology of
      the disorder. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that the development
      of IBS symptoms is often preceded by a disruption of the individual's normal
      intestinal microbiota, and microbiological studies have demonstrated
      compositional differences in the intestinal microbiota between patients with IBS 
      patients and healthy controls. In addition, animal studies and a few recent human
      clinical studies have demonstrated that compositional changes in the intestinal
      microbiota in IBS are associated with relevant abnormal gastrointestinal and
      brain-gut axis functions that are often observed in patients with IBS. This
      article discusses points of interest from the current research on the
      microbiota-gut-brain interactions in IBS and highlights the relevance of the
      emerging data to our understanding of the disorder and the clinical implications 
      for patients' care.

AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as 
      supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent
      years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions 
      on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by 
      the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of
      probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined 
      the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract
      infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal
      disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a
      deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune
      system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to
      establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design 
      of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising 
      results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical
      studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the
      outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics
      in clinical practice.

AB  - We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new type of dietary fiber (high
      specific volume polysaccharide) for use in treating constipation of different
      etiologies. Functional constipation patients and irritable bowel
      syndrome-constipation (IBS-C) patients were administrated high specific volume
      polysaccharide (HSVP) three times daily for a period of 2 wk to relieve their
      symptoms. Scores on a stool form scale, and patient reports of straining during a
      bowel movement, having sensations of an incomplete bowel movement or a blocked
      anorectum, and abnormal defecation intervals were recorded, graded, and scored by
      a functional constipation sample group. Similarly, a cohort of IBS-C patients
      reported their occurrence of abdominal discomfort or pain, abnormal stool
      formation, defecation frequency, and straining during a bowel movement.
      Additionally, both groups reported any adverse reactions associated with taking
      HSVP. All patients in both groups returned for follow-up visits, and no adverse
      reactions to treatment with HSVP were reported. In the functional constipation
      group, HSVP was effective for treating symptoms of constipation in 81.46% and
      93.17% of patients after 7 and 14 d of dosing, respectively (both p<0.05). In the
      IBS-C group, symptoms of constipation were relieved in 71.67% and 88.34% of
      patients after 7 and 14 d of dosing, respectively (both p<0.05). High specific
      volume polysaccharide was shown be effective for treatment of functional
      constipation and IBS-C, without causing significant adverse events.

      indications, such as autism, chronic fatigue syn- drome, and irritable bowel
      syndrome, or simply as a healthy dietary choice for anyone. The basics of the
      gluten-free diet are explored, with evidence-based indications and nursing
      implications when patients choose gluten-free.

TI  - Psychological Factors in Irritable Pouch Syndrome and Other Pouch Disorders.
PG  - 2815-24
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000552 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the 
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative
      colitis. Postsurgery, functional and inflammatory complications of the ileal
      pouch often occur. Our previous study demonstrated that irritable pouch syndrome 
      (IPS) is associated with the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, suggesting an
      influence of psychological factors on patients' symptoms. The aim of this study
      was to identify the specific psychological factors and coping strategies in
      patients with functional (IPS) and inflammatory (pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's
      disease of the pouch) pouch disorders. METHODS: Consecutive patients with
      functional pouch disorders (IPS), inflammatory pouch conditions, and asymptomatic
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis patients were surveyed using validated measures of
      quality of life (the Cleveland Global Quality of Life [CGQL] and Irritable Bowel 
      Syndrome-Quality of Life [IBS-QOL]), daily functional impairment (WSAS), coping
      mechanisms (brief COPE) and anxiety/depression (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of 243
      patients surveyed, 157 (64.6%) completed the surveys, of whom 137 (56.4%) met
      inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Sixty-one percent of
      respondents had pouch inflammation (pouchitis, N = 35; cuffitis, N = 14; and
      Crohn's disease of the pouch, N = 35), 20% had IPS (N = 27) and 19% (N = 26) had 
      asymptomatic normal pouches. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 79 years
      with the mean ages of patients with normal pouches, IPS and inflammatory pouch
      conditions being 51.7 +/- 12.5, 47.1 +/- 15.0, 47.2 +/- 15.1 years, respectively.
      Patients with IPS were more likely to be taking antidepressants, anxiolytics, or 
      narcotics than the other groups (P < 0.04). Patients with IPS or inflammatory
      pouches had significantly poorer quality of life (CGQL, P < 0.001; IBS-QOL, P <
      0.003) than those with asymptomatic pouches, with differences particularly in the
      areas of food avoidance, activity interference, and sexual difficulties. Those
      with IPS (median = 11; interquartile range [IQR]: 3-19) or inflammatory pouch
      conditions (median = 7; IQR: 3-18) had a greater impairment in the domains of
      daily functioning related to the pouch condition than those with normal pouches
      (median = 1.5; IQR: 0-6; P = 0.003). The mean depression symptom scores were
      significantly higher in the IPS group than in the normal pouch group (11.7 +/-
      9.7 versus 4.4 +/- 6.2; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: IPS patients were more likely to
      have depressive symptoms and had a greater amount of impairment in daily
      functioning related to their pouch condition. Additionally, patients with
      functional pouch disorders are more likely to be concurrently treated with
      antidepressants, anxiolytic or narcotic agents than those with inflammatory
      pouches or normal pouches.

TI  - Lactose Intolerance in Adults: Biological Mechanism and Dietary Management.
PG  - 8020-35
LID - 10.3390/nu7095380 [doi]
AB  - Lactose intolerance related to primary or secondary lactase deficiency is
      characterized by abdominal pain and distension, borborygmi, flatus, and diarrhea 
      induced by lactose in dairy products. The biological mechanism and lactose
      malabsorption is established and several investigations are available, including 
      genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. Lactose intolerance depends not only
      on the expression of lactase but also on the dose of lactose, intestinal flora,
      gastrointestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and sensitivity 
      of the gastrointestinal tract to the generation of gas and other fermentation
      products of lactose digestion. Treatment of lactose intolerance can include
      lactose-reduced diet and enzyme replacement. This is effective if symptoms are
      only related to dairy products; however, lactose intolerance can be part of a
      wider intolerance to variably absorbed, fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides 
      and polyols (FODMAPs). This is present in at least half of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and this group requires not only restriction of
      lactose intake but also a low FODMAP diet to improve gastrointestinal complaints.
      The long-term effects of a dairy-free, low FODMAPs diet on nutritional health and
      the fecal microbiome are not well defined. This review summarizes recent advances
      in our understanding of the genetic basis, biological mechanism, diagnosis and
      dietary management of lactose intolerance.

TI  - Effect of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, BB-12(R), 
      on defecation frequency in healthy subjects with low defecation frequency and

PG  - 1638-46

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Bifidobacterium
      animalis subsp. lactis, BB-12(R), on two primary end points - defecation
      frequency and gastrointestinal (GI) well-being - in healthy adults with low
      defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort. A total of 1248 subjects were
      included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After a 2-week 
      run-in period, subjects were randomised to 1 or 10 billion colony-forming units/d
      of the probiotic strain BB-12(R) or a matching placebo capsule once daily for 4
      weeks. Subjects completed a diary on bowel habits, relief of abdominal discomfort
      and symptoms. GI well-being, defined as global relief of abdominal discomfort,
      did not show significant differences. The OR for having a defecation frequency
      above baseline for >/=50% of the time was 1.31 (95% CI 0.98, 1.75), P=0.071, for 
      probiotic treatment overall. Tightening the criteria for being a responder to an 
      increase of >/=1 d/week for >/=50 % of the time resulted in an OR of 1.55 (95% CI
      1.22, 1.96), P=0.0003, for treatment overall. A treatment effect on average
      defecation frequency was found (P=0.0065), with the frequency being significantly
      higher compared with placebo at all weeks for probiotic treatment overall (all
      P<0.05). Effects on defecation frequency were similar for the two doses tested,
      suggesting that a ceiling effect was reached with the one billion dose. Overall, 
      4 weeks' supplementation with the probiotic strain BB-12(R) resulted in a
      clinically relevant benefit on defecation frequency. The results suggest that
      consumption of BB-12(R) improves the GI health of individuals whose symptoms are 
      not sufficiently severe to consult a doctor (ISRCTN18128385).

      Challenge and Implications for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disorders: A
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 541-51
LID - 10.3945/an.114.007930 [doi]
AB  - Studies administering plasma protein isolates (PPIs) to experimentally challenged
      animals have reported improvements in growth, food intake, and overall condition 
      when compared with animals fed control diets, due in part to improvements in gut 
      barrier function, normalization of cytokine signals, and support of enteric
      immune function. These and early clinical studies suggest that nutritional
      therapy with PPIs may similarly assist in restoring homeostasis to gut barrier
      function in humans experiencing mild or more acute enteropathic symptomatology
      such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This
      meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food
      intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various 
      enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched 
      from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords. Twenty-nine
      articles retrieved through this process were evaluated; 11 studies including 13
      experiments were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The meta-analysis
      included descriptive analyses and methods for combining P values for the primary 
      endpoint, average daily growth (ADG) at week 1, and secondary endpoints including
      ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) at weeks 1
      and 2 and at the end of study. Primary and secondary endpoint analyses of growth 
      (ADG, ADFI, and G:F) were significant (P < 0.01). The proinflammatory cytokines
      interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly 
      lower in animals fed dietary PPIs. Additional research in patients experiencing
      symptoms of enteropathy will further characterize the benefits of PPIs in
      clinical populations.

AB  - Wheat products make a substantial contribution to the dietary intake of many
      people worldwide. Despite the many beneficial aspects of consuming wheat
      products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac disease
      (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can
      result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be
      excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from
      IBS symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation
      caused by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not
      clear that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence
      that carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS
      patients are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to
      a GFD.

TI  - [Fecal transplantation the future therapy?].
PG  - 73-6
AB  - Intestinal bacteria play an important role in human physiology, taking part in
      the metabolism, absorption of nutrients and regulation of the immune system. In
      many illnesses the bacterial imbalance in the digestive tract occurs, and fecal
      transplantation is one method that allows you to restore the balance. The essence
      of the described method is to replace the pathogenesis, abnormal bacterial flora 
      with the flora occurring in normal healthy individuals. So far, the main use of
      the method described in the article is resistant to antibiotics Clostridium
      difficile infection, which gives you a chance to avoid total colectomy. The
      article presents an accurate description of the same procedure to prepare the
      material, the selection of donor, recipient preparation and diseases, such as
      inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes and obesity, in
      which this method of treatment is currently practised.

AB  - This cross-sectional study evaluates the relations between the water load test in
      childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders with food intake and nutritional 
      status. Patients with functional dyspepsia required a lower maximum water intake 
      to produce fullness (n = 11, median = 380 mL) than patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (n = 10, median = 695 mL) or functional abdominal pain (n = 10, median =
      670 mL) (P < 0.05). Among patients who ingested </=560 mL (n = 17) or >560 mL (n 
      = 14) in the water load test, there was no relation between the maximum drinking 
      capacity and food intake, body mass index, or height.

TI  - Clinical response in Mexican patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated with 
      a low diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAP).

LID - 10.1016/j.rgmx.2015.06.008 [doi]
LID - S0375-0906(15)00074-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The low FODMAP diet eliminates carbohydrates and fermentable alcohols
      because they are not absorbed by the intestine, but are fermented by the
      microbiota, causing bloating and flatulence. AIMS: To evaluate the clinical
      response to the low FODMAP diet in patients with the different clinical subtypes 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients attended to at
      the Gastroenterology Department in 2014 that were diagnosed with IBS based on the
      Rome III criteria were included in the study. They were managed with a low FODMAP
      diet for 21 days and their response to the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, 
      flatulence, and stool form pre and post-diet were evaluated through the visual
      analogue scale, Bristol scale, and patient overall satisfaction. The results were
      analyzed by means, 95% CI, and the Student's t test. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients 
      included in the study, 87% were women and the mean age was 46.48 years.
      Distribution was: IBS-C 64.5%, IBS-D 22.6%, and IBS-M 12.9%. The score for pain
      was 6.0 (95% CI 5.04-6.96) and the post-diet score was 2.77 (95% CI 1.60-3.95)
      (P<.001). The score for bloating was 7.10 (95% CI 6.13-8.06) and the post-diet
      score was 4.19 (95% CI 2.95-5.44) (P<.001). The score for flatulence was 5.94
      (95% CI 4.79-7.08) and the post-diet score was 3.06 (IC95% 1.99-4.14) (P<.001).
      The pre-diet Bristol Scale result was 3.68 (95% CI 3.14-4.22) and the post-diet
      result was 4.10 (95% CI 3.66-4.54) (P=.1). The satisfaction percentage was 70.9%.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this first study on a Mexican population with IBS, there was
      significant improvement of the main symptoms, including pain, bloating, and
      flatulence after treatment with a low FODMAP diet.

TI  - More Than Telemonitoring: Health Provider Use and Nonuse of Life-Log Data in
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Weight Management.
PG  - e203
LID - 10.2196/jmir.4364 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The quantified self, self-monitoring or life-logging movement is a
      trend to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's
      daily life in terms of inputs (eg food consumed), states (eg mood), and
      performance (mental and physical). Consumer self-monitoring mobile phone apps
      have been widely studied and used to promote healthy behavior changes. Data
      collected through life-logging apps also have the potential to support clinical
      care. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an in-depth understanding of providers'
      facilitators and barriers to successfully integrating life-log data into their
      practices and creating better experiences. We specifically investigated three
      research questions: How do providers currently use patient-collected life-log
      data in clinical practice? What are provider concerns and needs with respect to
      this data? What are the constraints for providers to integrate this type of data 
      into their workflows? METHODS: We interviewed 21 health care
      providers-physicians, dietitians, a nurse practitioner, and a behavioral
      psychologist-who work with obese and irritable bowel syndrome patients. We
      transcribed and analyzed interviews according to thematic analysis and an
      affinity diagramming process. RESULTS: Providers reported using self-monitoring
      data to enhance provider-patient communication, develop personalized treatment
      plans, and to motivate and educate patients, in addition to using them as
      diagnostic and adherence tools. However, limitations associated with current
      systems and workflows create barriers to regular and effective review of this
      data. These barriers include a lack of time to review detailed records, questions
      about providers' expertise to review it, and skepticism about additional benefits
      offered by reviewing data. Current self-monitoring tools also often lack
      flexibility, standardized formats, and mechanisms to share data with providers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Variations in provider needs affect tracking and reviewing needs.
      Systems to support diagnosis might require better reliability and resolution,
      while systems to support interaction should support collaborative reflection and 
      communication. Automatic synthesis of data logs could help providers focus on
      educational goals while communication of contextual information might help
      providers better understand patient values. We also discuss how current mobile
      apps and provider systems do, and do not, support these goals, and future design 
      opportunities to realize the potential benefits of using life-logging tools in
      clinical care.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet with reduced content of fermentable short-chain
      carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs])
      has been reported to be effective in the treatment of patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no evidence of its superiority to
      traditional dietary advice for these patients. We compared the effects of a diet 
      low in FODMAPs with traditional dietary advice in a randomized controlled trial
      of patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, parallel,
      single-blind study of 75 patients who met Rome III criteria for IBS and were
      enrolled at gastroenterology outpatient clinics in Sweden. Subjects were randomly
      assigned to groups that ate specific diets for 4 weeks-a diet low in FODMAPs (n =
      38) or a diet frequently recommended for patients with IBS (ie, a regular meal
      pattern; avoidance of large meals; and reduced intake of fat, insoluble fibers,
      caffeine, and gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, and onions), with
      greater emphasis on how and when to eat rather than on what foods to ingest (n = 
      37). Symptom severity was assessed using the IBS Symptom Severity Scale, and
      patients completed a 4-day food diary before and at the end of the intervention. 
      RESULTS: A total of 67 patients completed the dietary intervention (33 completed 
      the diet low in FODMAPs, 34 completed the traditional IBS diet). The severity of 
      IBS symptoms was reduced in both groups during the intervention (P < .0001 in
      both groups before vs at the end of the 4-week diet), without a significant
      difference between the groups (P = .62). At the end of the 4-week diet period, 19
      patients (50%) in the low-FODMAP group had reductions in IBS severity scores
      >/=50 compared with baseline vs 17 patients (46%) in the traditional IBS diet
      group (P = .72). Food diaries demonstrated good adherence to the dietary advice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet low in FODMAPs reduces IBS symptoms as well as traditional
      IBS dietary advice. Combining elements from these 2 strategies might further
      reduce symptoms of IBS. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02107625.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that can have a significant 
      impact on a person's quality of life. The cause of IBS is unknown but several
      mechanisms have been proposed including visceral hypersensitivity, central
      sensitisation, abnormal gut motility and altered gut microbiota. IBS is
      challenging to manage and many patients report insufficient symptomatic relief
      from treatment. Approximately 60% of patients identify food as a trigger for
      their symptoms, and there has been interest in exclusion diets for managing IBS. 
      Dietary adaptation is a common self-management strategy for patients with IBS,
      with many self-diagnosing intolerance to specific foods. This may lead to
      patients adopting over-restrictive or inappropriate diets. In recent years, a
      diet low in poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates, known collectively as
      FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and
      polyols), has been advocated for the treatment of IBS. Here, we discuss the
      background to the FODMAP diet and review the evidence supporting its use for
      people with IBS.

TI  - The role of vitamin D in reducing gastrointestinal disease risk and assessment of
      individual dietary intake needs: Focus on genetic and genomic technologies.
PG  - 119-33
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201500243 [doi]
AB  - With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because 
      of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary
      sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing
      susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal
      cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel
      syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such
      diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake
      overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have
      revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature 
      of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating
      vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data,
      including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a
      position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
      proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency
      has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for
      considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary
      supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might
      beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for
      optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.

AB  - Remission of gastrointestinal and general symptoms after gluten withdrawal has
      been described in some non-celiac individuals for nearly 30 years. Only recently,
      efforts have been made to define this entity, now referred to as "non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity". It includes patients that clinically respond to gluten free 
      diet without exhibiting allergic or autoimmune features to explain such response.
      Wheat allergy, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and symptoms induced by
      high FODMAPs (Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols) consumption
      are the main differential diagnoses. The relationship with neuropsychiatric
      disorders such as schizophrenia and autism has not been demonstrated, but
      currently it gives ground to great hope in families with affected children.
      Epidemiology of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not clear. It is described as
      more common among women and less common in children. Genetic and immune factors, 
      changes in intestinal microbiota and non-gluten components present in wheat
      grains are main factors postulated in the pathogenesis of this condition. To
      date, there are no specific biomarkers for non-celiac gluten sensitivity and
      diagnosis is reached by excluding other causes of disease. A trial with
      gluten-free diet and subsequent gluten challenge is the methodology most
      frequently used to confirm diagnosis.

TI  - Placebo effects and their determinants in gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 472-85
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2015.117 [doi]
AB  - Placebo effects in clinical trials have sparked an interest in the placebo
      phenomenon, both in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in experimental
      gastroenterology. RCTs have demonstrated similar short-term and long-term placebo
      response rates in gastrointestinal compared to other medical diagnoses. Most
      mediators and moderators of placebo effects in gastrointestinal diseases are also
      of similar type and size to other medical diagnoses and not specific for
      gastrointestinal diagnoses. Other characteristics such as an increase in the
      placebo response over time and the placebo-enhancing effects of unbalanced
      randomization were not seen, at least in IBS. Experimental placebo and nocebo
      studies underscore the 'power' of expectancies and conditioning processes in
      shaping gastrointestinal symptoms not only at the level of self-reports, but also
      within the brain and along the brain-gut axis. Brain imaging studies have
      redressed earlier criticism that placebo effects might merely reflect a response 
      bias. These findings raise hope that sophisticated trials and experiments
      designed to boost positive expectations and minimize negative expectations could 
      pave the way for a practical and ethically sound use of placebo knowledge in
      daily practice. Rather than focusing on a 'personalized' choice of drugs based on
      biomarkers or genes, it might be the doctor-patient communication that needs to
      be tailored.

AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by chronic
      complaints arising from disorganized brain-gut interactions leading to
      dysmotility and hypersensitivity. The two most prevalent FGIDs, affecting up to
      16-26% of worldwide population, are functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel
      syndrome. Their etiopathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, however, recent
      observations reveal low-grade mucosal inflammation and immune activation, in
      association with impaired epithelial barrier function and aberrant neuronal
      sensitivity. These findings come to challenge the traditional view of FGIDs as
      pure functional disorders, and relate the origin to a tangible organic substrate.
      The mucosal inflammatory infiltrate is dominated by mast cells, eosinophils and
      intraepithelial lymphocytes in the intestine of FGIDs. It is well established
      that mast cell activation can generate epithelial and neuro-muscular dysfunction 
      and promote visceral hypersensitivity and altered motility patterns in FGIDs,
      postoperative ileus, food allergy and inflammatory bowel disease. This review
      will discuss the role of mucosal mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract with a 
      specific focus on recent advances in disease mechanisms and clinical management
      in irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined by symptoms of abdominal 
      pain and altered bowel habits without detectable organic disease. Antidepressants
      and serotonin receptor modulators are used to treat IBS, but rare serious adverse
      events highlight the safety hurdle. Newer drugs with secretory and motility
      effects via local gut mechanisms have been successfully approved for IBS, often
      by registering first in a related, non-IBS condition to optimize dosing,
      formulation and therapeutic window. AREAS COVERED: This review looks at
      approaches for novel IBS drug discovery. The underlying pathologies can be
      tackled locally from the 'outside-in' (intestinal lumen, mucosa and
      neuromuscular) to identify therapeutic targets. The article discusses the
      mechanisms associated with bile acid malabsorption, microbial dysbiosis,
      decreased intestinal barrier function, immune dysregulation, motility and
      visceral hypersensitivity. EXPERT OPINION: Challenges for new drug discovery are 
      the unknown mechanisms underlying IBS, making it difficult to predict clinically 
      efficacious molecular targets, limited options for translational research and
      disease progression biomarkers. Drugs acting locally via multiple targets (e.g., 
      eluxadoline [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Viberzi (eluxadoline)
      for IBS-D on May 27th 2015], crofelemer) to validated mechanisms are proving
      successful with tolerable safety margins. Novel mechanisms, identified and
      optimized based on the emerging role of nutrient signaling, probiotics or
      microbial products, are promising. Therapeutic treatment earlier in disease
      progression may improve response and have longer term benefits.

TI  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea have lower disease-specific
      quality of life than irritable bowel syndrome-constipation.

AB  - AIM: To determine effect of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subtype on
      IBS-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire and its subscales. METHODS: We
      studied IBS patients visiting our functional gastroenterology disorder clinic at 
      a tertiary care center of Unites States. IBS and IBS subtype were diagnosed using
      Rome-III questionnaire. QOL was assessed using IBS-QOL questionnaire. IBS-QOL
      assesses quality of life along eight subscales: dysphoria, interference with
      activities, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social reactions, sexual
      health, and effect on relationships. IBS-QOL and its subscales were both scored
      on a range of 0-100 with higher scores suggestive of better QOL. Results of
      overall IBS-QOL scores and subscale scores are expressed as means with 95%CI. We 
      compared mean IBS-QOL score and its subscales among various IBS-subtypes.
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the mean difference between more
      than two groups after controlling for age and gender. A post-hoc analysis using
      Bonferroni correction was used only when P value for ANOVA was less than 0.05.
      RESULTS: Of 542 patients screened, 243 had IBS as per Rome-III criteria.
      IBS-mixed (IBS-M) was the most common IBS subtype (121 patients, 49.8%) followed 
      by IBS- diarrhea (IBS-D) (56 patients, 23.1%), IBS-constipation (IBS-C) (54
      patients, 22.2%) and IBS-unspecified (IBS-U) (12 patients, 4.9%). Overall IBS-QOL
      scores were significantly different among various IBS-subtypes (P = 0.01).
      IBS-QOL of patients with IBS-D (61.6, 95%CI: 54.0-69.1) and IBS-M (63.0, 95%CI:
      58.1-68.0) was significantly lower than patients with IBS-C (74.5, 95%CI:
      66.9-82.1) (P = 0.03 and 0.02 respectively). IBS-D patients scored significantly 
      lower than IBS-C on food avoidance (45.0, 95%CI: 34.8-55.2 vs 61.1, 95%CI:
      50.8-71.3, P = 0.04) and interference with activity (59.6, 95%CI: 51.4-67.7 vs
      82.3, 95%CI: 74.1-90.6, P < 0.001). IBS-M patients had more interference in their
      activities (61.6, 95%CI: 56.3-66.9 vs 82.3, 95%CI: 74.1-90.6, P = 0.001) and
      greater impact on their relationships (73.3, 95%CI: 68.4-78.2 vs 84.7, 95%CI:
      77.2-92.2, P = 0.02) than IBS-C patients. Patients with IBS-M also scored
      significantly lower than IBS-C on food avoidance (47.2, 95%CI: 40.7-53.7 vs 61.1,
      95%CI: 50.8-71.3, P = 0.04) and social reaction (66.1, 95%CI: 61.1-71.1 vs 80.0, 
      95%CI: 72.1-87.7, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: IBS-D and IBS-M patients have lower
      IBS-QOL than IBS-C patients. Clinicians should recognize food avoidance, effects 
      on daily activities and relationship problems in these patients.

TI  - Potential role of the intestinal microbiota in programming health and disease.
PG  - 32-40
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuv039 [doi]
AB  - The composition of the microbiota varies according to prenatal events, delivery
      methods, infant feeding, infant care environment, and antibiotic use. Postnatal
      gut function and immune development are largely influenced by the intestinal
      microbiota. Emerging evidence has shown that early microbiota colonization may
      influence the occurrence of later diseases (microbial programming). The vast
      majority of microbial species (commensals) give rise to symbiotic host-bacterial 
      interactions that are fundamental for human health. However, changes in the
      composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may be associated with several
      clinical conditions, including obesity and metabolic diseases, autoimmune
      diseases and allergy, acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and 
      allergic IBS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on recent advances,
      modulation of gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or fermented dairy
      products has been suggested as a treatment of, or prevention for, different
      disorders such as IBS, infectious diarrhea, allergic disease, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis.

TI  - Recent developments in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 7621-36
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i25.7621 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, the
      pathophysiology of which is not completely known, although it has been shown that
      genetic/social learning factors, diet, intestinal microbiota, intestinal
      low-grade inflammation, and abnormal gastrointestinal endocrine cells play a
      major role. Studies of familial aggregation and on twins have confirmed the
      heritability of IBS. However, the proposed IBS risk genes are thus far
      nonvalidated hits rather than true predisposing factors. There is no convincing
      evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, with the effect 
      exerted by diet seemingly caused by intake of poorly absorbed carbohydrates and
      fiber. Obesity is a possible comorbidity of IBS. Differences in the microbiota
      between IBS patients and healthy controls have been reported, but the association
      between IBS symptoms and specific bacterial species is uncertain. Low-grade
      inflammation appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of a major subset of
      IBS, namely postinfectious IBS. The density of intestinal endocrine cells is
      reduced in patients with IBS, possibly as a result of genetic factors, diet,
      intestinal microbiota, and low-grade inflammation interfering with the regulatory
      signals controlling the intestinal stem-cell clonogenic and differentiation
      activities. Furthermore, there is speculation that this decreased number of
      endocrine cells is responsible for the visceral hypersensitivity, disturbed
      gastrointestinal motility, and abnormal gut secretion seen in IBS patients.

TI  - The role of fiber supplementation in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1002-10
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000425 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder associated with a
      wide variety of clinical symptoms. The use of fiber in treatment of IBS is well
      established, but recent reviews have shown conflicting evidence. The aim of our
      review was to study the effects of fiber (soluble and insoluble) on the symptoms 
      of IBS. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov
      were searched for appropriate studies. Two reviewers screened the title/abstract 
      and full text against the inclusion criterion - that is, randomized control
      trials/crossover studies that compare fiber with placebo for its effect on IBS in
      an outpatient setting. Independent double data extraction was performed across
      multiple fields. An assessment of the risk of bias and tests for heterogeneity
      were carried out, along with a meta-analysis of the outcomes of interest. The
      search yielded 4199 unique records: 121 were selected after title/abstract
      screening and 22 after full screening. There was moderate clinical,
      methodological, and statistical heterogeneity across studies, with a moderate
      risk of bias. Overall, there was a significant improvement in global assessment
      of symptoms among those randomized to fiber [risk ratio: 1.27; 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 1.05-1.54]. Soluble fiber improved assessment of symptoms (risk
      ratio 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09-2.03), as well as the abdominal pain score (mean
      difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.72 to -0.97), with insoluble fiber not showing
      improvement in any outcome. Soluble fiber appears to improve symptoms of IBS,
      whereas there is no evidence for recommending insoluble fiber for IBS.

PG  - 7545-52
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i24.7545 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the evolution of duodenal lymphocytosis (DL), a condition
      characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), over 2 years of
      follow-up. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy/histology for
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, weakness or other extraintestinal features
      compatible with celiac disease (CD) were included. Evaluation of IELs infiltrate 
      in duodenal biopsy samples was carried out by CD3-immunohistochemistry and
      expressed as number of positive cells/100 enterocytes. Diagnostic agreement on
      the IELs count was tested by calculating the weighted k coefficient. All patients
      underwent serological detection of autoantibodies associated with CD: IgG and IgA
      anti-tissue transglutaminase and endomysium. Each patient underwent further
      investigations to clarify the origin of DL at baseline and/or in the course of 2 
      years of follow-up every six months. Autoimmune thyroiditis, intestinal
      infections, parasitic diseases, bacterial intestinal overgrowth, hypolactasia and
      wheat allergy were detected. Colonoscopy and enteric magnetic resonance imaging
      were performed when necessary. Risk factors affecting the final diagnosis were
      detected by multinomial logistic regression and expressed as OR. RESULTS:
      Eighty-five patients (16 males, 69 females, aged 34.1 +/- 12.5 years) were
      followed up for a mean period of 21.7 +/- 11.7 mo. At baseline,
      endoscopy/duodenal biopsy, CD3 immunohistochemistry revealed: > 25 IELs/100
      enterocytes in 22 subjects, 15-25 IELs in 37 and < 15 IELs in 26. They all had
      negative serum anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium, whilst 5 showed IgG
      anti-gliadin positivity. In the course of follow-up, 23 developed CD
      seropositivity and gluten sensitivity (GS) was identified in 19. Other diagnoses 
      were: 5 Helicobacter pylori infections, 4 jejunal Crohn's disease, 1 lymphocytic 
      colitis and 1 systemic sclerosis. The disease in the remaining 32 patients was
      classified as irritable bowel syndrome because of the lack of diagnostic
      evidence. At multivariate analysis, the evolution towards CD was associated with 
      an IELs infiltrate > 25 (OR = 1640.4) or 15-25 (OR = 16.95), human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) DQ2/8 (OR = 140.85) or DQA1*0501 (OR = 15.36), diarrhea (OR = 5.56)
      and weakness (OR = 11.57). GS was associated with IELs 15-25 (OR = 28.59),
      autoimmune thyroiditis (OR = 87.63), folate deficiency (OR = 48.53) and diarrhea 
      (OR = 54.87). CONCLUSION: DL may have a multifactorial origin but the IELs
      infiltrate and HLA are strong predictive factors for CD development and a
      clinical diagnosis of GS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is currently one of the most common
      disorders of the digestive system in the Western society. Almost 2 out of 10
      people suffer from IBS with women being more affected than men. IBS is associated
      with abdominal pain, bloating and altered stool consistency and imposes a heavy
      burden for the affected patients. SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of IBS remains
      elusive although potential causes have been suggested, such as a deranged
      brain-gut signaling, hypersensitivity of visceral sensory afferent fibers,
      bacterial gastroenteritis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), genetic 
      alterations and food sensitivity. Targets for the pharmacotherapy of IBS include 
      the serotonergic and opioidergic system, and the microbial population of the gut.
      Alternative therapies like traditional Chinese medicine have shown some success
      in the combat against IBS. Key Messages: Many therapeutics for the treatment of
      IBS have emerged in the past; however, only a few have met up with the
      expectations in larger clinical trials. Additionally, the multifactorial etiology
      of IBS and its variety of cardinal symptoms requires an individual set of
      therapeutics. This review provides a short overview of potential causes and
      current pharmacological therapeutics and of additional and alternative therapies 
      for IBS.

TI  - The spectrum of noncoeliac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 516-26
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2015.107 [doi]
AB  - The past 5 years have seen an increase in the use of a gluten-free diet outside a
      diagnosis of coeliac disease or IgE-mediated wheat allergy. This trend has led to
      the identification of a new clinical entity termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity 
      (NCGS). In this Review, we discuss the evidence for NCGS as demonstrated by the
      results of double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary rechallenge studies.
      Furthermore, the characteristic phenotype of individuals with NCGS is described
      as well as the symptom manifestations commonly reported after gluten exposure,
      which include intestinal symptoms consistent with IBS, and extraintestinal
      symptoms such as neurological dysfunction, psychological disturbances,
      fibromyalgia and skin rash. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that NCGS can be
      associated with organic gastrointestinal pathologies, such as IBD, in which its
      presence might be a reflection of severe or stricturing disease. However, NCGS is
      not without its controversies and uncertainties, in particular pertaining to
      whether it is gluten or nongluten components of the grain evoking symptoms;
      evidence suggests that fermentable carbohydrates, amylase trypsin inhibitors and 
      wheat-germ agglutinin can also be responsible culprits. Finally, we discuss the
      novel techniques that might help diagnose NCGS in the future.

TI  - Diverticulitis: new insights on the traditional point of view.
PG  - 38-48
AB  - Diverticulosis of the colon is a common disease with an increasing incidence in
      Western countries. Recent literature has shown some changes in the traditional
      approach of this disease. The theory that diverticulosis is caused by a reduced
      intake of dietary fibre, is doubtful. There might be some chemical and
      histological overlap between diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel disease. High quality clinical study found no effect for
      antibiotics in acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis. Cyclic administration of
      mesalazine and rifaximin result in reduced symptoms of diverticular disease. For 
      the treatment of diverticular abscesses, percutaneous drainage shows promising
      results. Recurrence of acute diverticulitis is rare and most serious
      complications are linked to the first episode. Recent evidence does not support
      the traditional recommendation for elective surgery after two episodes of acute
      diverticulitis any more. This review summarizes the last evidence in diverticular
      disease and diverticulitis.

PG  - 7089-109
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i23.7089 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders, having a prevalence of 12%-30% in the general population. Most
      patients with IBS attribute their symptoms to adverse food reactions. We review
      the role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS and the importance of dietary factors
      in the management of these patients. The MEDLINE electronic database (1966 to Jan
      2015) was searched using the following keywords: "food", "diet", "food allergy", 
      "food hypersensitivity", "food intolerance", "IBS", "epidemiology",
      "pathogenesis", "pathophysiology", "diagnosis", "treatment". We found 153
      eligible papers; 80 were excluded because: not written in English, exclusive
      biochemical and experimental research, case reports, reviews, and research
      otherwise not relevant to our specific interest. We selected 73 papers: 43
      original papers, 26 reviews and 4 letters to the editor. These papers focused on 
      IBS pathogenesis, the association between IBS and atopy, and between IBS and food
      allergy, the relationship between IBS and non-celiac wheat sensitivity, the role 
      of diet in IBS. Pending further scientific evidence, a cautious approach is
      advisable but the concept of food allergy should be included as a possible cause 
      of IBS, and a dietary approach may have a place in the routine clinical
      management of IBS.

TI  - Symbiotics in irritable bowel syndrome--better than probiotics alone?
PG  - 485-9
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000199 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal
      disorder associated with significant physical and psychological comorbidity. The 
      etiology of the condition is uncertain but recent research suggests that the gut 
      bacterial composition may play a role in its development. Therefore, manipulation
      of the intestinal microbiome by using probiotics and symbiotics has the potential
      to improve patient outcomes in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous randomized
      controlled trials suggest a benefit of probiotics in the management of IBS, with 
      a significant reduction in the likelihood of symptoms persisting after therapy,
      and improvements in abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence when probiotics are
      compared with placebo. Evidence for the effect of probiotics on quality of life
      is conflicting. Relatively few randomized controlled trials have examined the
      effect of symbiotics on outcomes in IBS, but results thus far are promising.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in IBS. Data supporting the use of
      symbiotics is sparse. Whether symbiotics are superior to probiotics is unclear.

TI  - Diagnosis of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS): The Salerno Experts' Criteria.
PG  - 4966-77
LID - 10.3390/nu7064966 [doi]
AB  - Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal
      and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food,
      in subjects that are not affected by either celiac disease or wheat allergy.
      Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the
      procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts'
      recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the
      confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical
      response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten
      challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is
      performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version
      of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three
      main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale
      with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten
      challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout 
      of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle 
      should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 
      30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge
      should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The
      guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and
      positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies,
      if adopted internationally.

TI  - Poor predictive value of breath hydrogen response for probiotic effects in IBS.
PG  - 1731-9
LID - 10.1111/jgh.13015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous observations suggested that an early rise in breath
      hydrogen after lactulose (ERBHAL) may identify patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) likely to respond to probiotics. Therefore, we aimed to (i)
      investigate whether treatment with a probiotic changes breath hydrogen response
      in patients with ERBHAL and (ii) whether these changes identify patients who may 
      benefit symptomatically from probiotics. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial, patients with IBS (Rome III) were randomized to either 
      65 mL/day fermented milk product containing probiotic (FMPP) or placebo for 6
      weeks, followed by 6 weeks' open-label treatment and 6 weeks' withdrawal. Breath 
      hydrogen responses to lactulose (15 g) and liquid-gastric emptying time were
      evaluated before and at the end of each treatment period. Symptoms were measured 
      using a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: Loss of ERBHAL occurred in 36% of 23
      patients receiving FMPP and 41% of 22 receiving placebo (P = 1.00). Amongst 40
      patients who completed open-label FMPP treatment, ERBHAL was lost in a further
      38%, continued in 25%, and regained in 10%. Similar variability occurred in the
      withdrawal phase. Variability was unrelated to changes in gastric emptying. No
      differences in symptom response were seen between treatment groups nor in
      relation to the loss or retention of ERBHAL. CONCLUSIONS: Breath hydrogen
      patterns after lactulose are poorly reproducible. No FMPP-specific effects on
      fermentation patterns or symptoms were observed. The presence of ERBHAL is not
      useful to predict symptomatic response to probiotic therapy in patients with IBS.

TI  - [A meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 445-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics to treat irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Publications from database including PubMed, the
      Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, CBM and WanFang Data were searched up to August
      31, 2014. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on probiotics to treat IBS were
      eligible. The related articles were extracted and cross-checked independently by 
      two reviewers. Methodological quality of trials was evaluated according to
      Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.2
      software. RESULTS: A total of 17 RCTs involving 1 700 patients were included.
      Results of meta-analyses showed that compared with the placebo, probiotics was
      statistically better in improving the overall symptoms integral (SMD = -0.20, 95%
      CI -0.33--0.07, P = 0.002), alleviating abdominal pain/discomfort (SMD = -0.19,
      95% CI -0.29--0.09, P<0.001), relieving abdominal distention (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI
      -0.28--0.03, P = 0.020), and defecation discomfort (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI
      -0.42--0.02, P = 0.030). There was no statistical significance in the overall
      quality of life (SMD = -0.08, 95% CI -0.07-0.23, P = 0.290) and adverse effect
      ratio (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.79-1.49, P = 0.630). CONCLUSION: Probiotics have
      beneficial effects on IBS, which can improve the patients' symptoms and with less
      adverse reaction. Due to the bias, further large-scale, multicenter and
      high-quality RCTs are required to unify outcome indicators, further define
      sensitive strain, and standardize its usage, dosage and course of treatment.

TI  - Sensitivity to wheat, gluten and FODMAPs in IBS: facts or fiction?
PG  - 169-78
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309757 [doi]
AB  - IBS is one of the most common types of functional bowel disorder. Increasing
      attention has been paid to the causative role of food in IBS. Food ingestion
      precipitates or exacerbates symptoms, such as abdominal pain and bloating in
      patients with IBS through different hypothesised mechanisms including immune and 
      mast cell activation, mechanoreceptor stimulation and chemosensory activation.
      Wheat is regarded as one of the most relevant IBS triggers, although which
      component(s) of this cereal is/are involved remain(s) unknown. Gluten, other
      wheat proteins, for example, amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fructans (the latter
      belonging to fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)), have
      been identified as possible factors for symptom generation/exacerbation. This
      uncertainty on the true culprit(s) opened a scenario of semantic definitions
      favoured by the discordant results of double-blind placebo-controlled trials,
      which have generated various terms ranging from non-coeliac gluten sensitivity to
      the broader one of non-coeliac wheat or wheat protein sensitivity or, even,
      FODMAP sensitivity. The role of FODMAPs in eliciting the clinical picture of IBS 
      goes further since these short-chain carbohydrates are found in many other
      dietary components, including vegetables and fruits. In this review, we assessed 
      current literature in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity
      represent 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms. This knowledge is expected
      to promote standardisation in dietary strategies (gluten/wheat-free and low
      FODMAP) as effective measures for the management of IBS symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent gastrointestinal
      disorder, with only limited evidence regarding self-management approaches. This
      study tested the efficacy of caraway oil poultices (CarO) for treating IBS.
      METHODS: This randomized controlled open-label cross-over trial included three
      treatment periods with hot CarO and hot olive oil poultice (OlivH) or nonheated
      poultices (OlivC) with olive oil as control interventions. Patients applied each 
      intervention daily for 3 weeks. The primary outcome was symptom severity
      (IBS-SSS); secondary outcomes included responder rates (improvement >/= 50
      IBS-SSS), quality of life (EQ-5D, IBS-QOL), psychological distress (HADS),
      adequate relief, and safety. RESULTS: 48 patients with IBS were included (40
      females, 53.9 +/- 14.4 years). A significant difference was found for symptom
      severity in favor of CarO compared to OlivC (difference -38.4, 95% CI -73.6,
      -3.1, p = 0.033), but not compared to OlivH (difference -24.3, 95% CI -56.5, 7.9,
      p = 0.139). Responder rates were highest for CarO compared to OlivH and OlivC
      (43.9, 20.0, 18.9%, respectively). Within the CarO, 51.8% reported adequate
      relief compared to 23.5% (OlivH) and 25.8% (OlivC). One adverse event
      (gastrointestinal infection) was reported during CarO. CONCLUSION: Hot caraway
      oil poultices appear effective and safe, although their effects may be a result
      of the heat application. Patients reported highest levels of subjective benefit
      from caraway oil poultices, making their use appropriate in the self-management
      of IBS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not
      digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach 
      the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified
      according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different
      physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of
      the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber
      intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many
      neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an
      important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current 
      evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several
      different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended
      fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by
      searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion
      criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber
      types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like
      constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or
      short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement
      with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the
      prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with
      hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from
      fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the
      prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further
      investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.

TI  - Visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome: evidence for involvement
      of serotonin metabolism--a preliminary study.
PG  - 1127-37
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12600 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and visceral perception have
      been associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Aim of
      this preliminary study was to assess the effect of the direct precursor of 5-HT, 
      5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on systemic 5-HT metabolites and visceral perception
      and to assess potential differential responses between IBS and controls. METHODS:
      15 IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomized
      double-blind placebo controlled study. Visceroperception was measured by rectal
      barostat. The 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo was ingested orally. Serotonergic
      metabolites were assessed in platelet poor plasma. KEY RESULTS: 5-HTP induces
      rectal allodynia in a significant number of healthy controls; IBS patients
      exhibit lowered pain thresholds in both placebo and 5-HTP conditions. 5-HTP
      induces rectal hyperalgesia in hypersensitive but not in non-hypersensitive IBS
      patients. Administration of 5-HTP significantly increased plasma 5-HTP levels (p 
      < 0.001), did not affect 5-HT levels (p > 0.05), while levels of the main
      metabolite of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, increased significantly (p <
      0.05) in both groups. The magnitude of these changes observed in 5-HT metabolites
      was significantly greater in IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Oral
      administration of 5-HTP induced significant alterations in systemic 5-HT
      metabolites that were accompanied by increased visceroperception of pain in
      controls and hypersensitive IBS patients. Changes in 5-HT metabolism appear to be
      important factors involved in visceral hypersensitivity as the 5-HTP-induced
      pro-nociceptive response was observed in all hypersensitive IBS patients and to a
      lesser magnitude in a significant number of healthy controls but in none of the
      non-hypersensitive IBS patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is much interest in wheat sensitivity among people
      without celiac disease (CD), but little is known about any risks associated with 
      the condition. We evaluated the prevalence of autoimmune diseases (ADs) among
      patients with nonceliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), and investigated whether they
      carry antinuclear antibodies (ANA). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study
      of 131 patients diagnosed with NCWS (121 female; mean age, 29.1 years) at 2
      hospitals in Italy from January 2001 through June 2011. Data were also collected 
      from 151 patients with CD or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (controls). Patient
      medical records were reviewed to identify those with ADs. We also performed a
      prospective study of 42 patients (38 female; mean age, 34 years) diagnosed with
      NCWS from July 2011 through March 2014 at 3 hospitals in Italy. One hundred age- 
      and sex-matched subjects with CD or IBS served as controls. Serum samples were
      collected from all subjects and ANA levels were measured by immunofluorescence
      analysis. Participants completed a questionnaire and their medical records were
      reviewed to identify those with ADs. RESULTS: In the retrospective analysis,
      similar portions of subjects with NCWS (29%) and CD (29%) developed ADs (mainly
      Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 29 cases), compared with a smaller proportion of
      subjects with IBS (4%) (P < .001). In the prospective study, 24% of subjects with
      NCWS, 20% of subjects with CD, and 2% of subjects with IBS developed ADs (P <
      .001). In the retrospective study, serum samples tested positive for ANA in 46%
      of subjects with NCWS (median titer, 1:80), 24% of subjects with CD (P < .001),
      and 2% of subjects IBS (P < .001); in the prospective study, serum samples were
      positive for ANA in 28% of subjects with NCWS, 7.5% of subjects with CD (P =
      .02), and 6% of subjects with IBS (P = .005 vs patients with NCWS). ANA
      positivity was associated with the presence of the HLA DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes (P <
      .001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher proportions of patients with NCWS or CD develop
      autoimmune disorders, are ANA positive, and showed DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes compared
      with patients with IBS.

TI  - Symptom Profiles in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Functional
      Abdominal Pain Compared With Healthy Controls.
PG  - 323-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000795 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of gastrointestinal symptoms 
      are recommended to determine treatment effects for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      and functional abdominal pain (FAP). Study objectives were to compare the symptom
      profiles of pediatric patients with IBS or FAP with healthy controls and with
      each other using the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry 
      Scales, and to establish clinical interpretability of PRO scale scores through
      identification of minimal important difference (MID) scores. METHODS:
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by
      154 pediatric patients and 161 parents (162 families; IBS n = 46, FAP n = 119).
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when 
      eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea
      and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were
      administered along with Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A matched sample of 447
      families with healthy children completed the scales. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between patients with IBS or FAP compared
      with healthy controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes (>1.50) for symptoms 
      indicative of IBS or FAP, demonstrating a broad multidimensional gastrointestinal
      symptom profile and clinical interpretability with MID scores for individual PRO 
      scales. Patients with IBS manifested more symptoms of constipation, gas and
      bloating, and diarrhea than patients with FAP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS or 
      FAP manifested a broad gastrointestinal symptom profile compared with healthy
      controls with large differences, indicating the critical need for more effective 
      interventions to bring patient functioning within the range of healthy
      functioning.

TI  - Pediatric Functional Constipation Gastrointestinal Symptom Profile Compared With 
      Healthy Controls.
PG  - 424-30
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000869 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patient-reported outcomes are necessary to evaluate the
      gastrointestinal symptom profile of patients with functional constipation. Study 
      objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptom profile of pediatric
      patients with functional constipation with matched healthy controls with the
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Gastrointestinal Worry Scales and to establish clinical interpretability in
      functional constipation through identification of minimal important difference
      (MID) scores. The secondary objective compared the symptom profile of patients
      with functional constipation with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      METHODS: Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site
      study by 116 pediatric patients with functional constipation and 188 parents.
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when 
      eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea
      and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were
      administered along with Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A total of 341 families
      with healthy children and 43 families with patients with IBS completed the
      scales. RESULTS: A broad profile of gastrointestinal symptoms and worry were
      reported by patients with functional constipation in comparison with healthy
      controls (P < 0.001) with large effect sizes (>0.80) across the majority of
      symptom domains. Patients with IBS manifested a broader symptom profile than
      functional constipation, with differences for stomach pain, stomach discomfort
      when eating, and worry about stomachaches, with similar constipation scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with functional constipation report a broad
      gastrointestinal symptom profile in comparison with healthy controls and only
      somewhat fewer symptoms than patients with IBS, highlighting the critical need
      for more efficacious interventions to achieve healthy functioning.

TI  - Factors that influence the shedding of Blastocystis cysts in an irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patient--an evidence-based case study.
PG  - 2999-3005
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4502-3 [doi]
AB  - Blastocystis is one of the most common gut parasites found in the intestinal
      tract of humans and animals. We have previously reported the irregular shedding
      of Blastocystis cysts in stools from infected patients. In the present study, we 
      assess the factors influencing shedding patterns from a Blastocystis ST3-infected
      IBS patient. The stools samples were voluntarily submitted for examination for a 
      period of 30 days from Blastocystis ST3-infected IBS patient. A questionnaire on 
      the factors that could influence the shedding pattern of the cysts was designed
      to assess the following information: (a) the frequency of frequenting the toilet 
      in a day, (b) the timing of frequenting the toilet, (c) the stool forms, (d) the 
      type of mood the patient was in when frequenting the toilet and (e) food intake. 
      A total of 79 stool samples were collected for 30 days. The highest number of
      cysts recorded when the patient visited the toilet three times a day was 22.2 x
      10(6) cysts/g. Frequenting the toilet between 6 a.m. to 11.59 a.m. showed the
      highest number of cysts, i.e. 21.7 x 10(6) cysts/g. Semi-solid forms showed the
      highest cyst count, i.e. 2.00 x 10(6) cysts/g. Irregular shedding of cysts was
      seen in 10 out of 30 days where the widest range recorded on day 17 was between 0
      to 1.2 x 10(6) cysts/g. The average daily cyst count on days of emotional
      fluctuations was from 0 to 5.13 x 10(6) cysts/g. In conclusion, the study
      confirms that there are factors influencing shedding patterns of Blastocystis,
      and these have important implications when it comes to diagnosis and transmission
      of the parasite.

TI  - Deviations in human gut microbiota: a novel diagnostic test for determining
      dysbiosis in patients with IBS or IBD.
PG  - 71-83
LID - 10.1111/apt.13236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis is associated with many diseases, including irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), obesity and diabetes.
      Potential clinical impact of imbalance in the intestinal microbiota suggests need
      for new standardised diagnostic methods to facilitate microbiome profiling. AIM: 
      To develop and validate a novel diagnostic test using faecal samples to profile
      the intestinal microbiota and identify and characterise dysbiosis. METHODS:
      Fifty-four DNA probes targeting >/=300 bacteria on different taxonomic levels
      were selected based on ability to distinguish between healthy controls and IBS
      patients in faecal samples. Overall, 165 healthy controls (normobiotic reference 
      collection) were used to develop a dysbiosis model with a bacterial profile and
      Dysbiosis Index score output. The model algorithmically assesses faecal bacterial
      abundance and profile, and potential clinically relevant deviation in the
      microbiome from normobiosis. This model was tested in different samples from
      healthy volunteers and IBS and IBD patients (n = 330) to determine the ability to
      detect dysbiosis. RESULTS: Validation confirms dysbiosis was detected in 73% of
      IBS patients, 70% of treatment-naive IBD patients and 80% of IBD patients in
      remission, vs. 16% of healthy individuals. Comparison of deep sequencing and the 
      GA-map Dysbiosis Test, (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo, Norway) illustrated good
      agreement in bacterial capture; the latter showing higher resolution by targeting
      pre-determined highly relevant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The GA-map Dysbiosis Test
      identifies and characterises dysbiosis in IBS and IBD patients, and provides
      insight into a patient's intestinal microbiota. Evaluating microbiota as a
      diagnostic strategy may allow monitoring of prescribed treatment regimens and
      improvement in new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - No Effects of a Short-Term Gluten-free Diet on Performance in Nonceliac Athletes.
PG  - 2563-70
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000699 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Implementation of gluten-free diets among nonceliac athletes has rapidly
      increased in recent years because of perceived ergogenic and health benefits. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on
      exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being,
      intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS:
      Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive
      clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome
      (mean +/- SD; age, 32 +/- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +/- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +/- 11.8 
      cm, VO2max 59.1 +/- 8.0 mL.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1)) were allocated to a 7-d
      gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, 
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either
      gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while
      habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet,
      cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI 
      questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a
      submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time
      trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to
      determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers 
      (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze
      data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between 
      the GCD (245.4 +/- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +/- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during
      exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There
      were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13)
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI
      symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory
      markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.

      diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) are the most frequent pathologic conditions affecting the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract and both significantly reduce patients' quality of
      life. Recent studies suggest that guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) expressed in the GI
      tract constitutes a novel pharmacological target in the treatment of FGID and
      IBD. Endogenous GC-C agonists - guanylin peptides: guanylin and uroguanylin, by
      the regulation of water and electrolyte transport, are involved in the
      maintenance of homeostasis in the intestines and integrity of the intestinal
      mucosa. Linaclotide, a synthetic agonist of GC-C was approved by Food and Drug
      Administration and European Medicines Agency as a therapeutic in
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic 
      constipation (CIC). Lately, several preclinical and clinical trials focused on
      assessment of therapeutic properties of synthetic agonists of uroguanylin,
      plecanatide, and SP-333. Plecanatide is currently tested as a potential
      therapeutic in diseases related to constipation and SP-333 is a promising drug in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. PURPOSE: Here, we discuss the most recent findings 
      and future trends on the development of GC-C agonists and their use in clinical
      trials.

TI  - Intestinal symptoms and psychological factors jointly affect quality of life of
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have significantly
      reduced quality of life (QOL). Although intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, 
      as well as comorbid psychological disorders, may reduce the QOL of IBS patients, 
      the primary determinant of QOL in these patients remains unclear. This study
      aimed to identify the main factors affecting QOL in patients with IBS with
      diarrhea (IBS-D). METHODS: Consecutive patients meeting the Rome III Diagnostic
      Criteria for IBS-D were enrolled in this study. Patients with organic diseases
      were excluded. The intestinal symptoms, psychological states and QOL of these
      patients were evaluated using IBS-specific symptom questionnaires, the Hamilton
      Depression Scale (HAMD), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and the Chinese
      version of the IBS-QOL instrument. Overall scores for intestinal symptoms were
      calculated by frequency and degree. RESULTS: This study enrolled 227 IBS-D
      patients, of mean age 44.68 +/- 10.81 years. Their mean overall IBS-QOL score was
      71.68 +/- 18.54, with the lowest score being for food avoidance (53.71 +/-
      26.92). Overall IBS-QOL score correlated negatively with overall scores of
      intestinal symptoms and HAMD and HAMA scores (p < 0.001 each). Overall intestinal
      symptoms scores correlated negatively with HAMD and HAMA scores (p < 0.001 each).
      Scores of HAMD, HAMA and structural factors (i.e., anxiety/somatization,
      cognitive disorder, psychomotor retardation, psychic anxiety, and somatic
      anxiety) were significantly higher in female than in male patients (p < 0.01).
      Food avoidance and social reaction scores of female patients were significantly
      lower than those of male patients (p < 0.05 each). The degree of defecation
      urgency, frequency of passing mucus and psychomotor retardation were independent 
      factors predicting reduced QOL in IBS-D patients. CONCLUSION: Intestinal symptoms
      and psychological factors jointly reduce the QOL of IBS-D patients, with gender
      differences in the impact of both factors on QOL.

AB  - The gut microbiota has a significant role in human health and disease. Dysbiosis 
      of the intestinal ecosystem contributes to the development of certain illnesses
      that can be reversed by favorable alterations by probiotics. The published
      literature was reviewed to identify scientific data showing a relationship
      between imbalance of gut bacteria and development of diseases that can be
      improved by biologic products. The medical conditions vary from infectious and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea to obesity to chronic neurologic disorders. A
      number of controlled clinical trials have been performed to show important
      biologic effects in a number of these conditions through administration of
      prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics. Controlled clinical trials have
      identified a limited number of prebiotics, probiotic strains, and synbiotics that
      favorably prevent or improve the symptoms of various disorders including
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
      necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants, and hepatic
      encephalopathy. Studies have shown that probiotics alter gut flora and lead to
      elaboration of flora metabolites that influence health through 1 of 3 general
      mechanisms: direct antimicrobial effects, enhancement of mucosal barrier
      integrity, and immune modulation. Restoring the balance of intestinal flora by
      introducing probiotics for disease prevention and treatment could be beneficial
      to human health. It is also clear that significant differences exist between
      different probiotic species. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics together with
      bioinformatics have allowed us to study the cross-talk between the gut microbiota
      and the host, furthering insight into the next generation of biologic products.
