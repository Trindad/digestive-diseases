AB  - AIM: To determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: In this
      randomized triple-blind trial, adult IBS volunteers who were recruited according 
      to Rome III criteria received 10(9) or 10(10) colony-forming units of NCFM or
      placebo daily for 12 wk. IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), which constituted 
      the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes, including individual IBS symptoms,
      IBS-related QoL questionnaire, anxiety and depression, defecation frequency, and 
      stool consistency, were assessed at baseline at the end of the 8-wk run-in
      period, after 4 and 12 wk of intervention, and after a 4-wk washout. RESULTS: A
      total of 340 of 391 randomized volunteers completed the trial. IBS-SSS improved
      over 12 wk of treatment in all treatment groups, decreasing by a mean +/- SD of
      44.0 +/- 80.2, 50.8 +/- 82.4, and 48.3 +/- 72.2 in the placebo, active low-dose, 
      and active high-dose groups, respectively. Similarly, secondary outcomes did not 
      differ between treatment groups. However, in a post hoc analysis of volunteers
      with moderate to severe abdominal pain at baseline (VAS > 35/100), the treatment 
      significantly reduced the sensation of abdominal pain. Pain scores fell by 20.8
      +/- 22.8, 29.4 +/- 17.9, and 31.2 +/- 21.9 in the placebo, active low-dose, and
      active high-dose groups, respectively (P value for placebo vs combined active
      doses = 0.0460). CONCLUSION: NCFM alleviates moderate to severe abdominal pain,
      consistent with earlier observations of this strain mitigating visceral pain
      through increased analgesic receptor expression.

TI  - Can probiotics benefit children with autism spectrum disorders?
PG  - 10093-10102
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i46.10093 [doi]
AB  - Children with autism are commonly affected by gastrointestinal problems such as
      abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhea. In recent years, there has been a
      growing interest in the use of probiotics in this population, as it
      hypothetically may help to improve bowel habits and the behavioral and social
      functioning of these individuals. The gut microbiome plays an important role in
      the pathophysiology of organic as well as functional gastrointestinal disorders. 
      Microbial modification with the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and fecal
      transplantation have been effective in the treatment of conditions such as
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, pouchitis, and irritable bowel
      syndrome. The present review presents a number of reported clinical,
      immunological and microbiome-related changes seen in children with autism
      compared to normally developed children. It also discusses gut inflammation,
      permeability concerns, and absorption abnormalities that may contribute to these 
      problems. Most importantly, it discusses evidence, from human and animal studies,
      of a potential role of probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms
      in children with autism.

TI  - Gastrointestinal neuromuscular apparatus: An underestimated target of gut
      microbiota.
PG  - 9871-9879
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i45.9871 [doi]
AB  - Over the last few years, the importance of the resident intestinal microbiota in 
      the pathogenesis of several gastro-intestinal diseases has been largely
      investigated. Growing evidence suggest that microbiota can influence
      gastro-intestinal motility. The current working hypothesis is that
      dysbiosis-driven mucosal alterations induce the production of several
      inflammatory/immune mediators which affect gut neuro-muscular functions. Besides 
      these indirect mucosal-mediated effects, the present review highlights that
      recent evidence suggests that microbiota can directly affect enteric nerves and
      smooth muscle cells functions through its metabolic products or bacterial
      molecular components translocated from the intestinal lumen. Toll-like receptors,
      the bacterial recognition receptors, are expressed both on enteric nerves and
      smooth muscle and are emerging as potential mediators between microbiota and the 
      enteric neuromuscular apparatus. Furthermore, the ongoing studies on probiotics
      support the hypothesis that the neuromuscular apparatus may represent a target of
      intervention, thus opening new physiopathological and therapeutic scenarios.

TI  - A review of dose-responses of probiotics in human studies.
PG  - 143-151
LID - 10.3920/BM2016.0140 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic definition requires the administration of an 'adequate amount' in
      order to obtain a health benefit. What that amount should be is not indicated.
      Here, an overview is given of studies that investigated the dose-response
      relation of probiotics in human interventions. Studies were divided in;
      meta-analyses, meta-analyses on specific probiotic strains, and studies testing
      two or more doses of a probiotic (combination) in the same study. Meta-analyses
      on the effect of probiotics on antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) suggest a
      dose-response effect; for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea on the other
      hand no dose-response was observed. For other end-points; such as necrotising
      enterocolitis, prevention of atopic dermatitis and slow intestinal transit, no
      dose-response relation was identified in meta-analyses. For prophylaxis in
      colorectal cancer and relief of irritable bowel syndrome, no dose-response
      relation was determined. However, for blood pressure, a meta-analysis observed
      that higher doses (greater than 10(11) cfu) were more effective than lower doses.
      Meta-analyses of specific strains suggest a break-point for effectiveness of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children;
      no dose-response was observed for two other probiotics assessed. Studies
      comparing two or more doses indicate that faecal recovery and risk reduction of
      AAD follow a positive dose-response relationship. Other end-points such as immune
      markers, general health, and bowel function did not exhibit clear dose-response
      relations. For AAD, the findings are very compelling; both meta-analyses and
      dedicated dose-response studies observe a positive correlation between dose and
      AAD risk. These findings do not allow for extrapolation, but suggest that
      studying higher doses for this end-point would be worthwhile. The lack of a clear
      dose-response for other end-points, does not mean it does not exist; present data
      does just not allow drawing any conclusions.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 is a probiotic that is used often in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Non-patients with bowel symptoms
      may differ from patients with IBS in the impact of their bowel symptoms on
      illness severity, healthcare and treatment seeking behavior. The aim of this
      study is to assess the efficacy of B. infantis 35624 (10(9) c.f.u. per day) for
      the relief of abdominal discomfort and bloating in a non-patient population.
      METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study with a
      2-week placebo run-in phase followed by a 4-week intervention phase was conducted
      at ten clinical centers (USA). Subjects were recruited from the general
      population by advertisement. The study randomized 302 subjects who experienced
      abdominal discomfort and bloating >/=2-times per week for at least three months
      but have not seen a physician or received prescribed medication for their
      symptoms in the past 12 months. Subjects were assessed for pre- to
      post-intervention changes in symptom severity (on a 6-point Likert scale; 0=none,
      5=very severe) and frequency (symptoms-free days). RESULTS: A total of 275
      subjects (mean age 42 years, 79% female, 74% Caucasian) provided evaluable data. 
      Overall mean severity scores at baseline were 2.4 for abdominal discomfort and
      2.5 for bloating with no significant differences between the placebo and
      probiotic groups. Both groups showed significant (P<0.05) improvement in
      abdominal discomfort and bloating scores over the 4-week intervention period.
      Mean severity symptom scores at the end of intervention showed no significant
      differences between the probiotic and the placebo groups in either abdominal
      discomfort or bloating (P>0.3). The frequency of abdominal bloating-free days was
      greater in the B. infantis 35624 group compared to the placebo group (P<0.05).
      Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous clinical studies 
      in patients with IBS, B. infantis 35624 did not show a significant improvement in
      the mean severity of symptoms of abdominal discomfort and bloating in a
      non-patient population. This may be explained by the high placebo effect and the 
      lower impact of functional bowel symptoms in the non-patient population.

TI  - Non-pharmacological management of abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders in children.
PG  - 389-398
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (AP-FGID)
      comprises of 4 main conditions: functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome,
      abdominal migraine and functional abdominal pain. AP-FGIDs are diagnosed
      clinically based on the Rome IV criteria for FGIDs of childhood. There is limited
      evidence for pharmacological therapies. DATA SOURCES: This review article
      discusses nonpharmacological management of AP-FGID based on the current
      literature including systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort and
      case control studies. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview on the available
      evidence for the pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists involved in
      managing children with AP-FGID. RESULTS: Managing AP-FGIDs can be challenging.
      This should follow a stepwise approach with focused history, identification of
      "red flag" signs and symptoms, physical examination and investigations done
      following initial consultation. Family needs explaining that there is nothing
      seriously wrong with the child's abdomen. This explanation and reassurance can
      achieve symptom control in large number of cases. Non-pharmacological
      interventions are delivered through lifestyle and dietary changes and
      bio-psychosocial therapies. Dietary interventions vary depending on the type of
      AP-FGID. Bio-psychosocial therapies such as hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral
      therapy and yoga aim at stress reduction. CONCLUSION: There is increasing
      evidence for use of non-pharmacological interventions in children with APFGID.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the composition of the resident bacteria within
      the gastrointestinal tract can influence the brain and behavior, particularly
      with respect to cognitive function. Cognitive function encompasses the life-long 
      process of learning, both long- and short-term processes. Cognition was
      originally thought to be exclusively regulated by the central nervous system,
      with long-term potentiation and neurogenesis contributing to the creation and
      storage of memories, but now other systems, including, for example, the immune
      system and the intestinal microbiome may also be involved. Cognitive impairment
      has been identified in numerous disease states, both gastrointestinal and
      extraintestinal in nature, many of which have also been characterized as having a
      role for dysbiosis in disease pathogenesis. This includes, but is not limited to,
      inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, type 1 diabetes, obesity, 
      major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. The role of cognition
      and the microbiome will be discussed in this chapter for all these diseases, as
      well as evidence for a role in maintaining overall human health and well being.
      Finally, evidence for a role for probiotics in beneficially modulating the
      microbiota and leading to improved cognition will be discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an important health problem
      that presents serious social burdens and high costs. Our study investigated the
      efficacy of synbiotic (Bifidobacterium lactis B94 with inulin), probiotic (B.
      lactis B94), and prebiotic (inulin) treatment for IBS in a pediatric age group.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was randomized, double-blind, controlled, and
      prospective in design and included 71 children between the ages of 4 and 16 years
      who were diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome III criteria. The first group
      received synbiotic treatment [5x109 colony forming units (CFU) of B. lactis B94
      and 900 mg inulin]; the second group received probiotic treatment (5x109 CFU B.
      lactis B94), and the third group received prebiotic treatment (900 mg inulin)
      twice daily for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment improved belching-abdominal
      fullness (p<0.001), bloating after meals (p=0.016), and constipation (p=0.031),
      and synbiotic treatment improved belching-abdominal fullness (p=<0.001), bloating
      after meals (p=0.004), constipation (p=0.021), and mucus in the feces (p=0.021). 
      The synbiotic group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with full
      recovery than the prebiotic group (39.1% vs. 12.5%, p=0.036). CONCLUSION:
      Administration of synbiotics and probiotics resulted in significant improvements 
      in initial complaints when compared to prebiotics. Additionally, there was a
      significantly higher number of patients with full recovery from IBS symptoms in
      the synbiotic group than in the prebiotic group. Therefore, the twice daily
      administration of synbiotics is suggested for the treatment of children with IBS.

TI  - Probiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products for functional and inflammatory
      bowel disorders.
PG  - 1426-1449
LID - 10.1111/bph.13632 [doi]
AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are
      very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on
      patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. 
      A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several
      therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional
      pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre
      and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both 
      groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several
      drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics,
      in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily
      peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and
      fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may
      be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative
      colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as
      mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to
      the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the
      low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate
      the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further,
      well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic
      options in the management of both FBD and IBD. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is

TI  - Probiotics and Liver Disease: Where Are We Now and Where Are We Going?
PG  - S188-S190
AB  - Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria capable of colonizing the colonic
      mucosa. The most common probiotics include strains of Lactobacillus or
      Bifidobacteria, which are part of the normal gastrointestinal microbiota. Initial
      studies of selected probiotic species have suggested potential efficacy in
      several gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases
      (particularly pouchitis), antibiotic-related diarrhea, Clostridium difficile
      toxin-induced colitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and
      allergy. The so-called "gut-liver axis" involves complex interaction between the 
      liver parenchyma and gut microbiota. There is growing evidence to suggest that
      alteration in gut microbial components may affect the liver and can be a
      precipitating cofactor in development and modulating of chronic liver damage
      through ethanol, production of ammonia and endotoxin. This may allow for a better
      understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of verities of liver diseases and
      help to identify a microbial target for prevention and treatment of such
      diseases. This paper discusses the growing evidence that highlights the
      relationship between gut microbiota and development, prevention and treatment of 
      numbers of liver diseases.

TI  - Probiotics and Diverticular Disease: Evidence-based?
PG  - S159-S160
AB  - Diverticular disease (DD) is a common gastrointestinal condition. Clinical
      spectrum ranges from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated or 
      complicated DD. Symptoms related to uncomplicated DD are not specific and may be 
      indistinguishable from those of irritable bowel syndrome. Low-grade inflammation,
      altered intestinal microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal colonic
      motility have been identified as factors potentially contributing to symptoms.
      Probiotics may modify the gut microbial balance leading to health benefits.
      Probiotics, due to their anti-inflammatory effects and ability to maintain an
      adequate bacterial colonization in the colon, are promising treatment options for
      DD. This review focuses on the available evidence on the efficacy of prebiotics
      in uncomplicated DD.

TI  - Oral probiotic treatment of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35((R)) prevents visceral 
      hypersensitivity to a colonic inflammation and an acute psychological stress.
PG  - 188-200
LID - 10.1111/jam.13320 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the efficacy of a repeated oral treatment with two
      active pharmaceutical ingredients (Lcr Lenio((R)) and Lcr Restituo((R)) )
      derivated from the probiotic bacterial strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35((R)) 
      in two animal models mimicking different features of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). IBS is characterized by visceral pain associated with alteration of bowel 
      transit. IBS patients present visceral hypersensitivity with peripheral and
      central origins. METHODS AND RESULTS: The injection of
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) into the proximal colon as well as an
      acute partial restraint stress (PRS) produces colonic hypersensitivity measured
      in conscious rats by a decrease in pain threshold in response to distal colonic
      distension. Visceral hypersensitivity was produced by injection of TNBS 7 days
      before colonic distension or by acute PRS on testing day. Treatments were
      performed once a day during eight consecutive days. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      indicates that an 8-day probiotic treatment (Lcr Lenio and Lcr Restituo) produces
      an antihypersensitivity activity in both TNBS and PRS visceral pain models. As
      this probiotic strain attenuates peripherally and centrally induced visceral
      hypersensitivity in rats, it may be active in treatment of IBS symptoms. An
      immunomodulatory effect of the probiotics was highlighted in the TNBS model on
      the IL-23 secretion, suggesting a mechanism of action involving a regulation of
      the local IL-23/Th17 immune activation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Two
      formulas of Lcr35((R)) probiotic strain show very encouraging results for the
      treatment of IBS patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the
      role and mechanisms of probiotics on the pathogenesis of IBS.

TI  - Review on Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4: Functionality and Nutraceutical
      Applications as a Probiotic Microorganism.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17091544 [doi]
LID - E1544 [pii]
AB  - Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 is a probiotic strain that has been used as a major 
      ingredient to produce nutraceutical products and as a dairy starter since 2000.
      The various bio-functional effects and potential for industrial application of B.
      bifidum BGN4 has been characterized and proven by in vitro (i.e., phytochemical
      bio-catalysis, cell adhesion and anti-carcinogenic effects on cell lines, and
      immunomodulatory effects on immune cells), in vivo (i.e., suppressed allergic
      responses in mouse model and anti-inflammatory bowel disease), and clinical
      studies (eczema in infants and adults with irritable bowel syndrome). Recently,
      the investigation of the genome sequencing was finished and this data potentially
      clarifies the biochemical characteristics of B. bifidum BGN4 that possibly
      illustrate its nutraceutical functionality. However, further systematic research 
      should be continued to gain insight for academic and industrial applications so
      that the use of B. bifidum BGN4 could be expanded to result in greater benefit.
      This review deals with multiple studies on B. bifidum BGN4 to offer a greater
      understanding as a probiotic microorganism available in functional food
      ingredients. In particular, this work considers the potential for commercial
      application, physiological characterization and exploitation of B. bifidum BGN4
      as a whole.

AB  - Chronic, non-infectious diarrhea can be caused by a variety of gastrointestinal
      diseases. In anamnesis, it is important to take accompanying warning symptoms and
      specific triggers into account. The fecal inflammatory marker calprotectin may
      help differentiating between organic and functional gastrointestinal disorders,
      but it is not specific. Among other options, gelling fibres, Loperamide and
      Cholestyramine as well as probiotics are available for the symptomatic treatment 
      of chronic diarrhea. For long-term treatment of chronic diarrhea with the
      enkephalinase inhibitor racecadotril, which is approved for acute diarrhea, only 
      limited data are available. Eluxadolin presents a new therapeutic option. It can 
      alleviate abdominal pain and diarrhea by modulation of opioid receptors in the
      enteric nervous system. Additional approaches in intractable irritable bowel
      syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) include 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, the antibiotic
      Rifaximin as well as low-dose tricyclic antidepressants. Specific diets such as
      the low-FODMAP diet can also relieve symptoms in IBS.

      uptodate.
PG  - 7186-202
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7186 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the
      pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is
      emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing
      benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics,
      synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize
      recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory
      disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora,
      probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles
      published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled
      trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A
      meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies.
      Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy
      in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available
      for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of 
      rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable
      bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized 
      as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.
      Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, 
      although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be 
      encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) has been found to significantly reduce symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet is best implemented in two phases: initial strict 
      elimination of foods high in FODMAPs, then gradual reintroduction based on
      symptoms. Further study of this diet's effect on intestinal microbiota is needed.

AB  - Background and Aim. The efficacy of supplementation treatment with two
      multispecies probiotic formulates on subjects diagnosed with IBS-C and the
      assessment of their gut microbiota were investigated. Methods. A randomized,
      double-blind, three-arm parallel group trial was carried out on 150 IBS-C
      subjects divided into three groups (F_1, F_2, and F_3). Each group received a
      daily oral administration of probiotic mixtures (for 60 days) F_1 or F_2 or
      placebo F_3, respectively. Fecal microbiological analyses were performed by
      species-specific qPCR to assess the different amount of probiotics. Results. The 
      percentage of responders for each symptom was higher in the probiotic groups when
      compared to placebo group during the treatment period (t60) and was maintained
      quite similar during the follow-up period (t90). Fecal analysis demonstrated that
      probiotics of the formulations increased during the times of treatment only in
      fecal DNA from subjects treated with F_1 and F_2 and not with F_3, and the same
      level was maintained during the follow-up period. Conclusions. Multispecies
      probiotic supplementations are effective in IBS-C subjects and induce a different
      assessment in the composition of intestinal microbiota. This clinical study is
      registered with the clinical study registration number ISRCTN15032219.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To report the indications and/or recommendations by Societies 
      and Institutions for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in functional
      intestinal disorders in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS: A position by Societies and
      Institutions is available only for infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome and
      constipation. Supplementation with the probiotic L reuteri DSM 17938 in breastfed
      term infants with colic appears to be effective in reducing crying, while still
      debated is its role in the prevention of colic. Irritable bowel syndrome is a
      common disorder in children and at present no specific treatments are available; 
      existing data show that although high-quality studies are still needed, some
      evidence support the efficacy of LGG and VSL#3 in paediatric IBS. At present
      there is no evidence for the use of pre- or probiotics in childhood constipation.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics in a near future may have a definite role is some FGIDs of
      infants and children. The main limitations for the recommendation by Societies
      and Institutions are the methodological issues that limit the quality of the
      evidence and the heterogeneity of treatments (probiotic strain and dose, mode,
      dose and duration of supplementation, primary outcomes, etc). Some specific
      strains are promising for infant colic (L. reuteri DSM 17938) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (LGG) while at present there is no indication for their use in the
      treatment of childhood constipation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence
      regarding probiotics treatment for pediatric IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: The overall
      management of children with IBS should be tailored to the patient's specific
      symptoms and identifiable triggers. The four major therapeutic approaches
      include: pharmacologic, dietary, psychosocial, and complementary/alternative
      medicine interventions.Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of
      pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and anti-diarrheals, these may
      have a role in severe cases. A Cochrane review concluded that only weak evidence 
      exists regarding beneficial effects of pharmacological agents in providing relief
      from symptoms in functional abdominal pain (AP) in children. Role of antibiotics 
      in treatment of children with IBS remains controversial. Various
      non-pharmacologic treatments are available for pediatric IBS. In a recent
      systematic review including 24 studies some evidence was found indicating
      beneficial effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), cognitive behavioral 
      therapy, hypnotherapy, and probiotics (LGG and VSL#3).Few randomized clinical
      trials (RCTs) are available in children. A meta-analysis including 9 trials which
      tested different probiotics as a treatment for Functional Gastrointestinal
      Disorders (FGIDs) in children and adolescents concluded that Lactobacillus GG,
      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and VSL#3 significantly increased treatment
      success. We recently showed that, in children with IBS, a mixture of
      Bifidobacterium infantis M-63(R), breve M-16V(R) and longum BB536(R) is safe and 
      is associated with better AP control and improved quality of life when compared
      to placebo. SUMMARY: Probiotics are emerging as new therapeutic tools in FGIDs,
      due to the recognition of the importance of gut microbiota in influencing
      brain-gut interactions, and of the role played by intestinal infections in the
      genesis of AP-FGIDs. Preclinical data suggest that changes in the gut microbiota 
      can affect brain signaling systems related to pain and associated emotional
      behavior. Therefore, probiotics could play a relevant role in the management of
      FGIDs, by affecting the gut microbiota or by altering brain function and pain
      perception centrally.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The number of preclinical and clinical studies showing efficacy of
      probiotics in the treatment and prophylaxis of certain diseases, e.g. diarrhoea
      of various origin, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,
      allergies, hypercholesterolemia, bacterial vaginosis, and colorectal cancer, is
      increasing. These health benefits are often species and strain specific. This
      article provides an overview of available knowledge about the supposed mechanisms
      of probiotic microorganisms action focusing in particular on the interaction
      between probiotic and host cells. One of the results of this interaction is
      induction of pro- or anti-inflammatory immune response in the macroorganism.
      Detailed knowledge of the signalling pathways involved in the communication
      between bacterial and human cells can find application in the selection of
      optimal probiotics for the targeted treatment of selected diseases. Additional
      possibilities for their use in clinical practice are provided by genetic
      manipulation of probiotic microorganisms. KEY WORDS: probiotics inflammation
      signalling pathways immunomodulation genetic manipulation.

AB  - In the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), loperamide seems efficacious 
      for diarrhea and ispaghula for constipation, while musculotropic spasmolytics may
      relieve abdominal pain. Antidepressants were found to be efficacious for
      abdominal pain, but their tolerance may be problematic and the therapeutic effect
      varied largely between trials. While meta-analyses suggest efficacy of probiotics
      as a group, the quality of the trials is often suboptimal and there is large
      variability. Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, and linaclotide, a
      guanylyl cyclase-C agonist, showed favorable effects on multiple symptoms in IBS 
      with constipation. For IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
      ramosetron showed efficacy in men and women, but is currently only approved in
      Japan. A multicenter study with the anti-emetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
      ondansetron showed efficacy on stool pattern in IBS-D. The poorly absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and eluxadoline, a mu opioid receptor agonist and delta
      antagonist, both showed efficacy in phase III trials in IBS-D and were approved
      by the FDA. Eluxadoline was associated with increased occurrence of sphincter of 
      Oddi spasm and biliary pancreatitis. The non-pharmacological treatment of IBS,
      with dietary interventions (mainly gluten elimination and low FODMAP (fructose,
      oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols)) has received a lot of attention
      lately. While responder rates vary across studies, perhaps based on regional
      variations in dietary intake of FODMAPs, the dietary approach seems to have
      acquired recognition as a valid therapeutic alternative. Long-term studies and
      comparative studies with pharmacotherapy, as well as elucidation of the
      underlying mechanisms of action, are needed.

TI  - Effects of probiotic type, dose and treatment duration on irritable bowel
      syndrome diagnosed by Rome III criteria: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s12876-016-0470-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional
      gastroenterological diseases, affecting 11.2 % of people worldwide. Previous
      studies have shown that probiotic treatment may benefit IBS patients. However,
      the effect of probiotics and the appropriate type, dose, and treatment duration
      for IBS are still unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess the
      efficacy of different probiotic types, doses and treatment durations in IBS
      patients diagnosed by Rome III criteria via a meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials up to October 2015 were searched. RCTs including
      comparisons between the effects of probiotics and placebo on IBS patients
      diagnosed by Rome III criteria were eligible. Dichotomous data were pooled to
      obtain the relative risk (RR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI), whereas
      continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95 
      % CI. RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Probiotic
      therapy was associated with more improvement than placebo administration in
      overall symptom response (RR: 1.82, 95 % CI 1.27 to 2.60) and quality of life
      (QoL) (SMD: 0.29, 95 % CI 0.08 to 0.50), but not in individual IBS symptoms.
      Single probiotics, a low dose, and a short treatment duration were more effective
      with respect to overall symptom response and QoL. No differences were detected in
      individual IBS symptoms in the subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are an
      effective pharmacological therapy in IBS patients. Single probiotics at a low
      dose and with a short treatment duration appear to be more effective in improving
      overall symptom response and QoL, but more evidence for these effects is still
      needed.

AB  - Depressive disorder is a stress-induced condition, which has been suggested to
      have bidirectional interactions with the gut microbiota. Probiotics such as
      Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus have been suggested to mitigate stress
      response. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a typical phenotype of psychological 
      distress manifested in the gastrointestinal system, and often develops in
      patients with depressive disorder. The altered gut microbiota and resultant
      inflammation in the gut play an important role in at least a portion of IBS.
      Animal models of depression have shown abnormalities in the gut such as increased
      gut permeability, and the probiotics ameliorate their chronic depression-like
      behaviors and altered stress responses. There have been only a few studies that
      have directly investigated the gut microbiota in patients with depression. We
      reported results suggesting that individuals with lower bacterial counts for
      Bifidobacterium and/or Lactobacillus are more common in patients with major
      depressive disorder than in healthy controls. the collectively use of gut
      microbiota in the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorder seems to be a
      promising approach.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined as a representative functional
      gastrointestinal disorder which is characterized by chronic or recurrent
      abdominal pain and/or abdominal discomfort associated with abnormal bowel
      movement. Gut microbiota are related to the pathophysiology of IBS. In the field 
      of IBS, post-infectious etiology, stress-induced alteration of microbiota,
      increased mucosal permeability, bacterial overgrowth, disease-specific
      microbiota, microbial products, and brain-gut interactions are being
      investigated. In some individuals, IBS develops after recovery from acute
      gastroenteritis known as post-infectious IBS. Gut microbiota in IBS patients
      differ from those in healthy individuals, and the profiles of gut microbiota in
      IBS patients also vary among IBS patients with constipation, diarrhea, and mixed 
      subtypes. In Japan, gut microbiota in IBS patients also differ from those
      observed in healthy individuals, and organic acid by-products observed in the
      patients correlated with symptoms, quality of life, and alexithymia. Further
      research on gut microbiota in IBS patients is warranted.

TI  - British Dietetic Association systematic review and evidence-based practice
      guidelines for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome in adults (2016
      update).
PG  - 549-75
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines for the
      dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults were published in 
      2012. Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this work
      was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the management 
      of IBS and to update the guidelines. METHODS: Twelve questions relating to diet
      and IBS were defined based on review of the previous guideline questions, current
      evidence and clinical practice. Chosen topics were on healthy eating and
      lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, elimination diets, fat and fluid
      intakes and dietary habits), milk and dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable
      carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and elimination diets/food hypersensitivity.
      Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase,
      Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to October 2015. Studies were assessed
      independently in duplicate using risk of bias tools specific to each included
      study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for each question. National
      Health and Medical Research Council grading evidence levels were used to develop 
      evidence statements and recommendations, in accordance with Practice-based
      Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the BDA. RESULTS: Eighty-six
      studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence statements, 15 clinical
      recommendations and four research recommendations. The IBS dietary algorithm was 
      simplified to first-line (healthy eating, provided by any healthcare
      professional) and second-line [low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) to be provided by dietitian] dietary 
      advice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide updated comprehensive
      evidence-based details to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS in
      adults.

PG  - 576-92
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are often taken by individuals with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Which products are effective is unclear, despite an increasing
      research base. This project will systematically review which strain- and dose-
      specific probiotics can be recommended to adults with IBS to improve symptoms and
      quality of life (QoL). It is part of a broader systematic review to update
      British Dietetic Association guidelines for the dietary management of IBS in
      adults. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science
      were searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trial (RCT)s 
      recruiting adults with IBS comparing probiotic intervention with placebo. AMSTAR,
      risk of bias and diet bias tools were used to appraise methodological quality.
      Symptom and QoL data were appraised to develop probiotic-specific evidence
      statements on clinically meaningful and marginal outcomes in various settings,
      graded clinical practice recommendations and practical considerations. RESULTS:
      Nine systematic reviews and 35 RCTs were included (3406 participants) using 29
      dose-specific probiotic formulations. None of the RCTs were at low risk of bias. 
      Twelve out of 29 probiotics (41%) showed no symptom or QoL benefits. Evidence
      indicated that no strain or dose specific probiotic was consistently effective to
      improve any IBS symptoms or QoL. Two general clinical practice recommendations
      were made. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom outcomes for dose-specific probiotics were
      heterogeneous. Specific probiotic recommendations for IBS management in adults
      were not possible at this time. More data from high-quality RCTs treating
      specific symptom profiles are needed to support probiotic therapy in the
      management of IBS.

AB  - Several key areas in gastroenterology pharmacotherapy are rapidly evolving,
      including the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV), irritable bowel syndrome,
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease. HCV treatment
      has radically changed in the past 2 years and now most patients are treatment
      candidates and have a high likelihood of permanent cure. Pharmacotherapy is now
      first-line treatment for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of therapy in
      gastric and duodenal ulcers and GERD, although long-term use carries the risk of 
      several side effects that should be considered.

      Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a
      significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of
      life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel
      syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in
      association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension.
      Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel
      movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of
      incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are
      therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and 
      pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond
      similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or 
      absence of pain, albeit not in an "all or nothing" manner. Severity depends not
      only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors
      (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of
      involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders
      are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been 
      made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016,
      and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between
      Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available
      treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods,
      fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating
      laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence,
      prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants,
      psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation,
      surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of 
      them.

TI  - Efficacy of double-coated probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized
      double-blind controlled trial.
PG  - 432-443
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1224-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of a
      dual-coated probiotic supplement (Duolac Care) on symptoms of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a randomized double-blind
      clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty subjects with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome were randomly assigned to either the non-coating group or the
      dual-coating group in order to receive two capsules per day of multi-species
      probiotics containing 5 billion bacteria per capsule for 4 weeks. Data from an
      adequate relief questionnaire were used in assessment of primary outcome. Daily
      records of stool frequencies and the Bristol stool scale, a weekly symptom diary 
      using 100-mm visual analog scale, and Beck depression inventories were collected.
      Blood tests including blood cell counts, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and regulatory T cells-CD4 +
      CD25(high) T cells, CD4 + LAP + T cells and CD25(high) + LAP + T cells-were
      analyzed before and after the study. The shift of gut microbiota was investigated
      using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS:
      Responses to the adequate relief questionnaire indicated significant improvement 
      in overall discomfort in the dual-coating group and the ratio of normal stools to
      hard or watery stools had a better effect from dual-coated probiotics compared to
      non-coated probiotics. This may be due to a shift of intestinal microbiota, as
      our correlation analysis showed significant negative correlation between
      Bifidobacterium and urgency of defecation. CONCLUSIONS: Our result implies that
      dual-coating layers of probiotic supplement can be a candidate for treatment of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - A number of diseases are associated with alterations in the composition of the
      microbiota of various niches of the human body. Although, in most cases, it is
      unclear if these alterations are the cause or the consequence of disease, they
      provide a rationale for therapeutic or prophylactic manipulation of a dysbiotic
      microbiota. Approaches to manipulate the microbiome include administration of
      either live bacteria, which are underrepresented in the diseased individual,
      substances that aim at increasing the populations of these bacteria, or a
      combination of the two. This chapter summarizes the available data in therapeutic
      manipulation of a various diseased states including irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, atopic and allergic
      diseases, and antibiotic-associated and infectious diarrhoea.

TI  - Effects of synbiotic fermented milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and
      Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 on the fecal microbiota of adults with
      irritable bowel syndrome: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentric study to 
      investigate the influence of a synbiotic fermented milk on the fecal microbiota
      composition of 30 adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The synbiotic
      product contained Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp.
      lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and dietary fiber (90% inulin, 10%
      oligofructose), and a heat-treated fermented milk without probiotic bacteria or
      dietary fiber served as placebo. Stool samples were collected after a run-in
      period, a 4-wk consumption period, and a 1-wk follow-up period, and were
      subjected to real-time PCR and 16S rDNA profiling by next-generation sequencing. 
      After 4wk of synbiotic (11 subjects) or placebo (19 subjects) consumption, a
      greater increase in DNA specific for L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium
      animalis ssp. lactis was detected in the feces of the synbiotic group compared
      with the placebo group by quantitative real-time PCR. After 1wk of follow-up, the
      content of L. acidophilus La-5 and B. animalis ssp. lactis decreased to levels
      close to initial levels. No significant changes with time or differences between 
      the groups were observed for Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, 
      or all bacteria. The presence of viable BB-12- and La-5-like bacteria in the
      feces resulting from the intake of synbiotic product was confirmed by random
      amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. At the end of consumption period,
      the feces of all subjects assigned to the synbiotic group contained viable
      bacteria with a BB-12-like RAPD profile, and after 1wk of follow-up, BB-12-like
      bacteria remained in the feces of 87.5% of these subjects. The presence of
      La-5-like colonies was observed less frequently (37.5 and 25% of subjects,
      respectively). Next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons revealed that
      only the percentage of sequences assigned to Strep. thermophilus was temporarily 
      increased in both groups, whereas the global profile of the fecal microbiota of
      patients was not altered by consumption of the synbiotic or placebo. In
      conclusion, daily consumption of a synbiotic fermented milk had a short-term
      effect on the amount and proportion of La-5-like strains and B. animalis ssp.
      lactis in the fecal microbiome of IBS patients. Furthermore, both synbiotic and
      placebo products caused a temporary increase in fecal Strep. thermophilus.

AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBDs) are the most common gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders seen by gastroenterologists and primary care physicians. The disorders 
      affect patients functioning and quality of life (QOL) and are associated with
      significant healthcare burden. The current theory regarding the development of
      FBDs suggests brain-gut axis dysfunctions associated abnormal GI motility and
      sensation. Recent data suggest that alterations in the intestinal microbiota may 
      have a role in the pathogenesis of FBDs; or at least have the potential to affect
      intestinal functions that are thought to be relevant to the development of
      functional GI symptoms. This has led to growing interest of healthcare providers 
      and patients in targeting the intestinal microbiota for the treatment of FBDs. In
      this article we discuss the potential role probiotic interventions in the
      treatment of FBDs. We review the evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies 
      and discuss the current recommendations for the use of probiotics for FBDs in
      clinical practice.

TI  - Probiotic Bacterial and Fungal Strains: Claims with Evidence.
PG  - 251-9
LID - 10.1159/000443359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. This review summarizes
      current (i.e. published in the last 5 years) key evidence on probiotic efficacy
      and its safety in adults and children. To identify relevant data, searches of
      MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in August 2015 to
      locate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or their meta-analyses. The focus was 
      on commonly used, well-specified, bacterial and yeast probiotics for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The MEDLINE database was also searched
      for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, developed by scientific
      societies in the same timeframe. Data on safety of probiotics were obtained from 
      a document developed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. KEY
      MESSAGES: A number of relevant RCTs and meta-analyses are available.
      Saccharomyces boulardii is the most studied yeast probiotic, and Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG is the most studied bacterial probiotic. For both, the best
      documented fact is their efficacy for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis,
      especially in children, and for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea,
      both in adults and children. There is some evidence to support the use of
      probiotics to prevent or treat other diseases, such as necrotizing enterocolitis,
      infantile colic, Helicobacter pylori infection, and irritable bowel syndrome, but
      further studies are needed to identify which strain(s) is/are the most effective.
      Data on safety, particularly long-term safety, are limited. The risk of side
      effects is greater in people who have severe underlying health conditions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on bacterial and yeast probiotics has considerably
      expanded during recent years. Accumulated data allow one to make informed
      decisions about the effectiveness of probiotics and about how to reduce the use
      of those without proven efficacy.

TI  - Update on the Management of Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Focus 
      on Rifaximin and Eluxadoline.
PG  - 300-16
LID - 10.1002/phar.1712 [doi]
AB  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is one of the most common
      diagnoses made by gastroenterologists. Current pharmacologic treatments for IBS-D
      include fiber supplements, antidiarrheal over-the-counter medications,
      probiotics, antispasmodics, antidepressants, and a 5-hydroxytryptophan 3 receptor
      antagonist. All of these options have limited efficacy in managing IBS-D.
      Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic, has been evaluated in patients with IBS-D.
      In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials evaluating
      rifaximin 550 mg by mouth 3 times/day for 14 days, the primary efficacy end point
      was achieved by 9% more patients randomized to the rifaximin group compared with 
      placebo (40.7% vs 31.7%, p<0.001, number needed to treat ~11). The primary
      efficacy end point was defined as the proportion of patients having adequate
      relief of global IBS symptoms for at least 2 of the 4 weeks during the primary
      follow-up period (weeks 3-6). In the phase III trial examining the efficacy and
      safety of repeated courses of rifaximin in patients who responded to the initial 
      2-week course, rifaximin given for up to two additional courses provided a
      statistically significant incremental benefit (33% vs 25%, p=0.02). Eluxadoline
      is a gut-targeting mu and kappa opioid receptor agonist and a delta opioid
      receptor antagonist. The dual mechanism of eluxadoline may explain the
      antidiarrheal and abdominal pain-modulating properties and lack of profound
      constipation. In two identically designed randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled phase III studies, 10.3% more patients in an eluxadoline 100
      mg by mouth twice/day group met the primary efficacy end point during the
      follow-up 1-12 week period compared with placebo (p<0.001). The primary efficacy 
      end point was a composite response, defined as improvement in worst abdominal
      pain and stool consistency at the same time on most (50% or more) days during the
      follow-up period. This review evaluates evidence for the use of rifaximin and
      eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D. Rifaximin provides an additional modality for
      the management of IBS-D patients; it has mild to moderate efficacy similar to
      other currently available treatment options. Rifaximin is relatively safe, lacks 
      significant drug-drug interactions, and can be used for up to two additional
      retreatment courses. This may make rifaximin a possible initial or second-line
      treatment option. Eluxadoline can also offer relief to patients with IBS-D. While
      effective, because of several limitations, including drug-drug interactions and
      drug disease contraindications, as well as current lack of clinical experience,
      it may be tried as a second- or third-line agent.

TI  - Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 supplementation in the management of diarrhea
      predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a double blind randomized placebo
      controlled pilot clinical study.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s12937-016-0140-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 has been marketed as a dietary
      ingredient, but its efficacy in diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) condition has not been clinically elucidated till date. Thus, a double
      blind placebo controlled multi-centered trial was planned to evaluate the safety 
      and efficacy of B. coagulans MTCC 5856 in diarrhea predominant IBS patients.
      METHODS: Thirty six newly diagnosed diarrhea predominant IBS patients were
      enrolled in three clinical centres. Along with standard care of treatment, 18
      patients in group one received placebo while in group two 18 patients received B.
      coagulans MTCC 5856 tablet containing 2 x 10(9) cfu/day as active for 90 days.
      Clinical symptoms of IBS were considered as primary end point measures and were
      evaluated through questionnaires. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for
      abdominal pain. Physician's global assessment and IBS quality of life were
      considered as secondary efficacy measures and were monitored through
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Laboratory parameters, anthropometric and vital signs
      were within the normal clinical range during the 90 days of supplementation in
      placebo and B. coagulans MTCC 5856 group. There was a significant decrease in the
      clinical symptoms like bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and stool
      frequency in a patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856 when compared to
      placebo group (p < 0.01). Similarly, disease severity also decreased and the
      quality of life increased in the patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856
      when compared to placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that the B.
      coagulans MTCC 5856 at a dose of 2 x 10(9) cfu/day along with standard care of
      treatment was found to be safe and effective in diarrhea predominant IBS patients
      for 90 days of supplementation. Hence, B. coagulans MTCC 5856 could be a
      potential agent in the management of diarrhea predominant IBS patients.

TI  - Altered gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome and its
      modification by diet: probiotics, prebiotics and the low FODMAP diet.
PG  - 306-18
LID - 10.1017/S0029665116000021 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by
      abdominal pain or discomfort with disordered defecation. This review describes
      the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and
      how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community.
      Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in
      IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which
      has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials 
      suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating 
      IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated
      effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel
      method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable
      carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides
      and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical
      effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one
      unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the
      microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal
      Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction
      in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has
      clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration.
      Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the 
      complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both
      interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment
      has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for
      optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects
      on the GI microbiota.

TI  - Gut microbiota role in irritable bowel syndrome: New therapeutic strategies.
PG  - 2219-41
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2219 [doi]
AB  - In the last decade the impressive expansion of our knowledge of the vast
      microbial community that resides in the human intestine, the gut microbiota, has 
      provided support to the concept that a disturbed intestinal ecology might promote
      development and maintenance of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As a
      correlate, manipulation of gut microbiota represents a new strategy for the
      treatment of this multifactorial disease. A number of attempts have been made to 
      modulate the gut bacterial composition, following the idea that expansion of
      bacterial species considered as beneficial (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria)
      associated with the reduction of those considered harmful (Clostridium,
      Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas) should attenuate IBS
      symptoms. In this conceptual framework, probiotics appear an attractive option in
      terms of both efficacy and safety, while prebiotics, synbiotics and antibiotics
      still need confirmation. Fecal transplant is an old treatment translated from the
      cure of intestinal infective pathologies that has recently gained a new life as
      therapeutic option for those patients with a disturbed gut ecosystem, but data on
      IBS are scanty and randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required.

AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

AB  - Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is the most common travel-related illness, and it can
      have a significant impact on the traveler. Pretravel consultation provides an
      excellent opportunity for the clinician to counsel the traveler and discuss
      strategies such as food and water hygiene, vaccinations, and medications for
      prophylaxis or self-treatment that may decrease the incidence and impact of TD.
      Postinfectious sequelae, such as postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome,
      reactive arthritis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, may develop weeks or months
      after return.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and
      function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent
      studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and
      to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut
      microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies
      underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and
      metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests 
      that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, 
      drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an
      adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early
      gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies
      using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have 
      yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use 
      is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric 
      disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in
      most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are
      anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut 
      microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for
      improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common, chronic relapsing gastrointestinal disorder
      that affects 7%-22% of the population worldwide. According to Rome III Criteria, 
      the disorder is defined by the coexistence of abdominal discomfort or pain
      associated with an alteration in bowel habits. Its pathophysiology is not
      completely understood but, in addition to some important abnormalities, the
      disturbed intestinal microbiota has also been described supported by several
      strands of evidence. The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome is based upon
      several therapeutic approaches but few have been successful or without adverse
      events and more recently the gut microbiota and the use of probiotics have
      emerged as a factor to be considered. Probiotics are live micro-organisms which
      when consumed in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host, such as
      Lactic bacteria among others. An important scientific rationale has emerged for
      the use of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, although the data regarding
      different species are still limited. Not all probiotics are beneficial: it is
      important to select the specific strain which should be supported by good
      evidence base. The mechanisms of action of probiotics are described and the main 
      strains are quoted.

TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome an infectious disease?
PG  - 1331-4
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i4.1331 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common of all gastroenterological
      diseases. While many mechanisms have been postulated to explain its etiology, no 
      single mechanism entirely explains the heterogeneity of symptoms seen with the
      various phenotypes of the disease. Recent data from both basic and clinical
      sciences suggest that underlying infectious disease may provide a unifying
      hypothesis that better explains the overall symptomatology. The presence of small
      intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) has been documented in patients with IBS and
      reductions in SIBO as determined by breath testing correlate with IBS symptom
      improvement in clinical trials. The incidence of new onset IBS symptoms following
      acute infectious gastroenteritis also suggests an infectious cause. Alterations
      in microbiota-host interactions may compromise epithelial barrier integrity,
      immune function, and the development and function of both central and enteric
      nervous systems explaining alterations in the brain-gut axis. Clinical evidence
      from treatment trials with both probiotics and antibiotics also support this
      etiology. Probiotics appear to restore the imbalance in the microflora and
      improve IBS-specific quality of life. Antibiotic trials with both neomycin and
      rifaximin show improvement in global IBS symptoms that correlates with breath
      test normalization in diarrhea-predominant patients. The treatment response to
      two weeks of rifaximin is sustained for up to ten weeks and comparable results
      are seen in symptom reduction with retreatment in patients who develop recurrent 
      symptoms.

LID - 10.2217/fmb.15.150 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are living micro-organisms that do not naturally have shelf life, and 
      normally are weakly protected against the digestive action of the GI tract. A new
      dual coating technology has been developed in an effort to maximize survival,
      that is, to be able to reach the intestine alive and in sufficient numbers to
      confer the beneficial health effects on the host. Dual-coating of lactic acid
      bacteria (LAB) is the result of fourth-generation coating technology for the
      protection of these bacteria at least 100-fold or greater than the uncoated LAB. 
      This innovative technique involves a first pH-dependent protein layer that
      protects bacteria from gastric acid and bile salt, and a second polysaccharide
      matrix that protects bacteria from external factors, such as humidity,
      temperature and pressure, as well as the digestive action during the passage
      through the GI tract. Dual-coated probiotic formulation is applicable to
      different therapeutic areas, including irritable bowel syndrome, atopic
      dermatitis, acute diarrhea, chronic constipation, Helicobacter pylori
      eradication, and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. An updated review 
      of the efficacy of doubly coated probiotic strains for improving bacterial
      survival in the intestinal tract and its consequent clinical benefits in humans
      is here presented.

TI  - Microbiota - a key to healing the gastrointestinal tract?
PG  - 21-4
AB  - At present, it is already known that many gastrointestinal tract diseases are
      caused by disorders of the intestinal ecosystem. The contribution of microbiota
      disorders to the development and sustaining of inlammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, constipation or bloating has
      been demonstrated in numerous scientiic studies. Another matter is bacterial
      imbalance in food allergy and atopic diseases. The effectiveness of probiotics
      and prebiotics in these diseases has been repeatedly conirmed, which made
      researchers search for new diseases in which probiotics could be an eficient
      therapeutic solution. Reports have also been published on microbiota disturbances
      in children with a spectrum of autistic disorders, depression or metabolic
      syndrome, and in obese patients. New micro -organisms have been discovered, which
      in addition to Lactobacillus or Biidobacterium bacteria, may signiicantly
      inluence the improvement of human health. Especially promising are two bacterial 
      species, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which seem to 
      interact in continuity regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. A. muciniphila 
      has the ability to degrade mucin, while producing acetic acid, propionic acid and
      oligosaccharides. These products become the substrate for F. prausnitzii, one of 
      the main producers of butyrate in the intestine. The anaerobic butyrate
      -producing bacterium helps to inhibit inlammation in the gastrointestinal tract, 
      while preventing increased intestinal permeability. Growth stimulation in
      bacteria (e.g. towards prebiotic therapy) may therefore prove to be a valuable
      nutritional option and an eficient way to restore the intestinal epithelium.
      While A. muciniphila is extensively studied in the context of obesity and
      diabetes, F. prausnitzii may become an interesting marker for Crohn's disease
      activity. The aim of this paper is to present new and promising aspects of
      intestinal microbiota restoration in the treatment of selected diseases.

TI  - Emerging treatments in neurogastroenterology: eluxadoline - a new therapeutic
      option for diarrhea-predominant IBS.
PG  - 26-35
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12716 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional
      gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. The global prevalence of IBS is estimated to
      be as high as 15%. For many patients, IBS is a chronic disorder which can
      significantly reduce quality of life. Just as important as the effects on any one
      individual, IBS also places a significant impact on the population as a whole
      with its negative effects on the health care system. Irritable bowel syndrome is 
      categorized into one of three main categories: IBS with diarrhea, IBS with
      constipation, and IBS with mixed bowel habits. Patients with diarrhea-predominant
      IBS (IBS-D) comprise a substantial proportion of the overall IBS population. A
      number of therapeutic options exist to treat the symptoms of abdominal pain,
      bloating, diarrhea, and fecal urgency, including non-pharmacologic therapies such
      as dietary changes and probiotics, or pharmacologic therapies such as loperamide 
      and alosetron. However, many patients have persistent symptoms despite these
      therapies. This unmet need led to the development of eluxadoline, a mu-opioid
      receptor agonist/delta-opioid receptor antagonist/kappa-receptor agonist.
      Approved by the FDA in May 2015, this medication shows promise in the treatment
      of diarrhea-predominant IBS for both men and women. PURPOSE: This monograph will 
      briefly review the impact of IBS, discuss current treatments for IBS-D, and then 
      focus on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of eluxadoline. Potential
      mechanisms related to rare events of acute pancreatitis or elevated liver tests
      will be discussed.

TI  - Probiotics in digestive diseases: focus on Lactobacillus GG.
PG  - 273-92
AB  - Probiotics are becoming increasingly important in basic and clinical research,
      but they are also a subject of considerable economic interest due to their
      expanding popularity. They are live micro-organisms which, when administered in
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. From this very well-known 
      definition, it is clear that, unlike drugs, probiotics might be useful in healthy
      subjects to reduce the risk of developing certain diseases or to optimise some
      physiological functions. They also may offer some advantages in already ill
      persons in relieving symptoms and signs, e.g. people with acute diarrhea.
      According to current definitions, probiotics should survive both gastric acid and
      bile to reach the small intestine and colon, where they exert their effects. Many
      of these are available in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) pill form, though some are
      available in yogurt or as packets (sachets), which can be mixed into
      non-carbonated drinks. The present review focuses on three main issues: 1)
      understanding why, at present, probiotics are so interesting for doctors and
      consumers; 2) reviewing the available data on probiotic use in digestive
      diseases, in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), (prevention of)
      infectious diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD), and colorectal cancer (CRC); 3) highlighting the individual
      profile of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the above contexts, providing an assessment 
      as well as recommendations on its use in gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) disorders.
      Research studies conducted in animals and humans with the main probiotics strains
      for GIT diseases, and published from the early 1990s to 2014 have been
      considered. PubMed, Medline and Ovid were the main sources adopted for data
      retrieving. The increasing attention on probiotics is a direct consequence of the
      improvement in the techniques for studying microbiota. Until recently, its
      composition has been analysed by culture-based methods that use differential
      media to select for specific populations of bacteria according to their metabolic
      requirements. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are by and large the most
      commonly used probiotics. Strictly speaking, however, the term "probiotic" should
      be reserved for live microbes that have been shown in controlled human studies to
      provide a health benefit. Taking into account patients suffering from the most
      common gastrointestinal diseases, in whose establishment the GI microbiota plays 
      a key role, probiotics have to be considered as very promising agents, capable of
      beneficially modulating the intestinal ecosystem, which is perturbed in cases of 
      dysbiosis. Although more clinical data are still needed to better assess the
      clinical relevance of probiotics, to date, procariota such as Bifidobacteria and 
      Lactobacilli strains, and eucariota such as some Saccharomyces strains are among 
      the most widely used agents in GIT disorders. LGG is a well-known probiotic
      strain that was isolated more than 20 years ago by Goldin and Gorbach from a
      faecal sample of a healthy adult, based on several selection criteria: high
      adhesion in vitro, high resistance against gastric acidity and high antimicrobial
      activity against pathogens such as Salmonella. In vivo studies have also shown a 
      good persistence of LGG in the human GIT. Since its isolation, LGG has become one
      of the best clinically documented probiotic strains. A growing body of evidence
      suggests benefits such as prevention and relief of various types of diarrhoea,
      and treatment of relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis. Thus, with respect to
      both adaptation to the GIT and probiotic effects, LGG can be regarded as a
      prototypical probiotic strain.

TI  - Can Probiotics Cure Inflammatory Bowel Diseases?
PG  - 904-17
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, especially microbial dysbiosis play role in
      several GI ailments such as irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer,
      inflammatory bowel diseases, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Role of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial as it involves loss of
      maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, increased release of
      pro-inflammatory molecules, and microbial dysbiosis in gut microflora. Some
      specific pathogens also play a key role in the IBD development. The origin and
      causation are still in unfathomable condition and the exact root cause is
      unknown. Recently probiotic studies have been gaining importance because of their
      positive responses in their IBD experimental results. According to joint Food and
      Agricultural Organisation/World Health Organisation working group, probiotics are
      defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amount confer 
      health benefit on the host. These live beneficial microorganisms are considered
      helpful in improving gut colonization and perseverance thereby improves
      prophylactic effect. In the direction of IBD research, a number of studies are
      needed to standardize its methodology and its applicability on human usage. The
      particular review presents an overview of gut microflora and its impact on host
      health, types of IBD and existing therapies to treat this disorder, mechanism of 
      several probiotic actions, role of probiotics in IBD prevention with their
      supporting evidences.

PG  - 37-49
LID - 10.1111/apt.13437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) is supported by various lines of evidence, including differences
      in mucosal and faecal microbiota between patients with IBS and healthy
      individuals, development of post-infectious IBS, and the efficacy of some
      probiotics and nonsystemic antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin). AIM: To review the
      literature regarding the role of rifaximin in IBS and its potential mechanism(s) 
      of action. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the terms
      'rifaximin', 'irritable bowel syndrome' and 'mechanism of action'. RESULTS:
      Rifaximin was approved in 2015 for the treatment of IBS with diarrhoea. In
      contrast to other currently available IBS therapies that require daily
      administration to maintain efficacy, 2-week rifaximin treatment achieved symptom 
      improvement that persisted >/=12 weeks post-treatment. The mechanisms of action
      of rifaximin, therefore, may extend beyond direct bactericidal effects. Data
      suggest that rifaximin may decrease host proinflammatory responses to bacterial
      products in patients with IBS. In some cases, small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) may play a role in the clinical symptoms of IBS. Because of the
      high level of solubility of rifaximin in the small intestine, rifaximin may reset
      microbial diversity in this environment. Consistent with this hypothesis,
      rifaximin has antibiotic efficacy against isolates derived from patients with
      SIBO. CONCLUSION: Resetting microbial diversity via rifaximin use may lead to a
      decrease in bacterial fermentation and a reduction in the clinical symptoms of
      IBS.

TI  - Efficacy of Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in Patients with Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome: a Double Blind Placebo-controlled Randomized Trial.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - AIM: to evaluate potential improvement effect for probiotic E. coliNissle 1917 in
      the management of refractory IBS in an Iranian population. METHODS: a double
      blind placebo controlled approach has been used in the current clinical trial.
      139 confirmed IBS patients were included into the study, and were given probiotic
      E.coli Nissle 1917 for 6 weeks. 11 items Birmingham IBS Symptom Questionnairehas 
      been used for evaluation of changes in the symptoms every 2 weeks. RESULTS: sixty
      eight subjects (49%) were males. Mean+/-SD age of the participants was 38+/-13.3 
      years. 49(35.3%) of the patients were diarrhea-predominant. The total scores
      showed no significant difference between the intervention vs. control
      group(-6.7+/-6.8 vs. -6.7+/-6.5, respectively; p=0.95); neither did any of the
      questionnaire items any significant alterations in the two groups. After
      stratification of patients based on their IBS type, diarrhea-predominant patients
      showed a positive response to the probiotic improving their sleep (p=0.05 and
      0.03 at weeks 2 and 6, respectively). Patients with constipation-predominant IBS 
      showed no response to the probiotic; while patients with diarrhea-constipation
      mixed IBS showed unfavorable response to the probiotic in the need for strain to 
      pass a motion compared to the placebo (p=0.03 and 0.02 at weeks 4 and 6,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: probiotic therapy with E.coli Nissle 1917 was not able
      to induce significant improvement in the symptoms of patients with
      non-categorized IBS. Nevertheless, when IBS patients were recategorized to
      subgroups according to their main symptoms, evaluation of the efficacy of the
      probiotic on some individual items in the symptom list reached the significance
      level. Prospective clinical trials are recommended to confirm our findings.

AB  - This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium,
      held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects 
      of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and
      inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology.
      Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on
      probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on
      probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases,
      the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects
      of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on 
      probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as
      well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet.
      Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including
      immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory
      properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between
      periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing,
      and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on 
      a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on
      the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic
      categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.

AB  - Probiotics are foods or products that contain live microorganisms that benefit
      the host when administered. In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature
      associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, 
      focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis,
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized
      controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also
      suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an 
      adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed
      babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these
      findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for
      the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's
      disease.

AB  - Probiotics are viable microorganisms with the capacity to alter the
      gastrointestinal microbiota of the host. The recent scientific advancements and
      development of probiotic formulations have rekindled the importance of these
      clinical interpretations, underlining the starring role of the gut flora in host 
      metabolism, defense and immune regulation. Despite encouraging preliminary
      results from randomized clinical trials of probiotics for various clinical
      conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, infantile colic, and improvement
      of digestion and immune function, further evidence is needed to determine the
      reproducibility of the findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In this 
      review, we have considered the postnatal development of gut flora and appraised
      the role of probiotics in health and disease condition among infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Meta-analyses point to a modest but significant effect of
      probiotics on symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to assess the 
      effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on symptoms and quality
      of life in IBS patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      intervention study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IBS patients (Rome II) between 18 and 
      65 years of age were included. The study consisted of an 8-week intervention
      period in which the participants received probiotic (LcS) or placebo twice daily,
      followed by an 8-week follow-up period. Symptom diaries and quality of life were 
      scored at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The primary outcome parameter was a decrease of at
      least 30% in a composite mean symptom score (MSS) at week 8 on the basis of an
      intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-nine individuals (67% women) were
      included in the probiotic group and 41 individuals (71% women) were included in
      the placebo group. After the intervention period, the mean relative improvement
      did not reach 30% for MSS or any individual symptom score. After follow-up (week 
      16), a mean improvement of at least 30% was achieved for MSS in the probiotic
      group, but no significant difference was found between both treatment groups
      (mean+/-SD: 34+/-7%; 13+/-8%, P=0.06). CONCLUSION: After probiotic treatment with
      LcS, no improvement of 30% in MSS was observed after 8 weeks.

TI  - Quantitative Risk-Benefit Analysis of Probiotic Use for Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1007/s40264-015-0349-x [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have seen widespread use for a variety of gastrointestinal problems,
      especially in two common disorders: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory
      bowel disease. Since a wide variety of probiotic preparations has been used, and 
      despite a large number of studies performed, a great deal of heterogeneity exists
      among them. Straightforward evidence-based recommendations for the use of
      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease have thus
      been difficult to formulate. In an effort to improve understanding of the
      risk-benefit balance of probiotics in these conditions, this study (1) queried
      the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for all reported
      adverse drug events related to probiotics in 2013, and (2) constructed
      risk-benefit planes for both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease using a geometric approximation of the confidence region between risk and
      benefit. The results show that adverse events from probiotics vary widely by
      disease, and when they occur, they are mild and may be difficult to distinguish
      from the natural history of the underlying disorders they are used to treat. The 
      risk-benefit plane for irritable bowel syndrome straddles the risk-benefit
      threshold, so patients can expect a balance between a low chance of risk and also
      a low chance of benefit. The risk-benefit plane for inflammatory bowel disease
      largely lies above the risk-benefit threshold, so patients may expect more
      benefit than risk in most cases. More standardized and high-quality research is
      needed to improve our understanding of risk and benefit for these complex
      biopharmaceuticals.

TI  - Practical management of irritable bowel syndrome: a clinical review.
PG  - 30-48
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder,
      frequently managed by general practitioners and gastroenterologists. It is a
      complex condition, characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with 
      altered bowel habits, and it affects 11% of the population worldwide. It has a
      profound effect on quality of life for many patients and poses a substantial cost
      to society. Due to the complexity and diversity of IBS, diagnosis and treatment
      can be challenging. Common drawbacks in diagnosing and treating this disorder
      include unnecessary tests, failure to establish trust in the physician-patient
      relationship and difficulties in explaining the diagnosis. Research in recent
      years has however refined the diagnostic criteria and improved our ability to
      safely identify IBS with a limited number of investigations. A concise diagnostic
      evaluation, guided adequate information, prompt initiation of symptom-guided
      treatment and consistency in the patient-doctor relationship can help relieve the
      suffering experienced by patients with IBS. For patients with mild symptoms,
      reassurance, education, lifestyle changes and dietary advice are often
      sufficient. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms might need symptom
      modifying drugs, and psychological treatments such as CBT or hypnotherapy may be 
      offered at this stage. For patients with severe and incapacitating symptoms, a
      multidisciplinary approach is recommended and psychotropic drugs are often used. 
      This clinical review offers suggestions for a diagnostic approach as well as a
      treatment strategy, based on the current evidence on pathophysiology, diagnosis
      and treatment in IBS.

      Triennial Yale/Harvard Workshop on Probiotic Recommendations. The recommendations
      update those of the first 3 meetings that were published in 2006, 2008, and 2011.
      Recommendations for the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis, childhood
      diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and Clostridium
      difficile diarrhea are reviewed. In addition, we have added recommendations for
      liver disease for the first time. As in previous publications, the
      recommendations are given as A, B, or C ratings.

AB  - Although probiotics have been used for many years by those who suffer from what
      would now be defined as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a scientific rationale
      for their use in this indication and clinical evidence to support their benefits 
      have only emerged very recently. Evidence to support considering strategies, such
      as probiotics, that modulate the gut microbiome, in IBS, has been provided by
      laboratory studies implicating the microbiome and the host response to the
      enteric microenvironment in IBS, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies
      demonstrating the ability of various commensal bacteria to influence such
      relevant functions as motility, visceral sensation, gut barrier integrity, and
      brain-gut interactions. Clinical studies supporting a role for probiotics in the 
      management of IBS predated such experimental data, and randomized controlled
      trials of probiotics in IBS continue to be reported. Their interpretation is
      hampered by the less than optimal quality of many studies; nevertheless, it is
      apparent that probiotics, as a category, do exert significant effects in IBS.
      Defining the optimal strain, dose, formulation, and duration of therapy is more
      challenging given the limitations of available data. There is also an urgent need
      for appropriately powered and rigorously designed clinical trials of appropriate 
      duration of probiotics in IBS; such studies should also help to define those who 
      are most likely to respond to probiotics. Future laboratory and translational
      research should attempt to define the mechanism(s) of action of probiotics in IBS
      and explore the response to bacterial components or products in this common and
      oftentimes troublesome disorder.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent and the best studied
      functional gastrointestinal disorder. The etiology and the pathogenesis of IBS
      are still not clear; however, recent studies have implicated a role for
      alterations in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) in the pathophysiology of
      the disorder. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that the development
      of IBS symptoms is often preceded by a disruption of the individual's normal
      intestinal microbiota, and microbiological studies have demonstrated
      compositional differences in the intestinal microbiota between patients with IBS 
      patients and healthy controls. In addition, animal studies and a few recent human
      clinical studies have demonstrated that compositional changes in the intestinal
      microbiota in IBS are associated with relevant abnormal gastrointestinal and
      brain-gut axis functions that are often observed in patients with IBS. This
      article discusses points of interest from the current research on the
      microbiota-gut-brain interactions in IBS and highlights the relevance of the
      emerging data to our understanding of the disorder and the clinical implications 
      for patients' care.

AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as 
      supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent
      years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions 
      on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by 
      the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of
      probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined 
      the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract
      infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal
      disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a
      deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune
      system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to
      establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design 
      of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising 
      results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical
      studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the
      outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics
      in clinical practice.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Bifidobacterium
      animalis subsp. lactis, BB-12(R), on two primary end points - defecation
      frequency and gastrointestinal (GI) well-being - in healthy adults with low
      defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort. A total of 1248 subjects were
      included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After a 2-week 
      run-in period, subjects were randomised to 1 or 10 billion colony-forming units/d
      of the probiotic strain BB-12(R) or a matching placebo capsule once daily for 4
      weeks. Subjects completed a diary on bowel habits, relief of abdominal discomfort
      and symptoms. GI well-being, defined as global relief of abdominal discomfort,
      did not show significant differences. The OR for having a defecation frequency
      above baseline for >/=50% of the time was 1.31 (95% CI 0.98, 1.75), P=0.071, for 
      probiotic treatment overall. Tightening the criteria for being a responder to an 
      increase of >/=1 d/week for >/=50 % of the time resulted in an OR of 1.55 (95% CI
      1.22, 1.96), P=0.0003, for treatment overall. A treatment effect on average
      defecation frequency was found (P=0.0065), with the frequency being significantly
      higher compared with placebo at all weeks for probiotic treatment overall (all
      P<0.05). Effects on defecation frequency were similar for the two doses tested,
      suggesting that a ceiling effect was reached with the one billion dose. Overall, 
      4 weeks' supplementation with the probiotic strain BB-12(R) resulted in a
      clinically relevant benefit on defecation frequency. The results suggest that
      consumption of BB-12(R) improves the GI health of individuals whose symptoms are 
      not sufficiently severe to consult a doctor (ISRCTN18128385).

AB  - Intestinal bacteria play an important role in human physiology, taking part in
      the metabolism, absorption of nutrients and regulation of the immune system. In
      many illnesses the bacterial imbalance in the digestive tract occurs, and fecal
      transplantation is one method that allows you to restore the balance. The essence
      of the described method is to replace the pathogenesis, abnormal bacterial flora 
      with the flora occurring in normal healthy individuals. So far, the main use of
      the method described in the article is resistant to antibiotics Clostridium
      difficile infection, which gives you a chance to avoid total colectomy. The
      article presents an accurate description of the same procedure to prepare the
      material, the selection of donor, recipient preparation and diseases, such as
      inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes and obesity, in
      which this method of treatment is currently practised.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined by symptoms of abdominal 
      pain and altered bowel habits without detectable organic disease. Antidepressants
      and serotonin receptor modulators are used to treat IBS, but rare serious adverse
      events highlight the safety hurdle. Newer drugs with secretory and motility
      effects via local gut mechanisms have been successfully approved for IBS, often
      by registering first in a related, non-IBS condition to optimize dosing,
      formulation and therapeutic window. AREAS COVERED: This review looks at
      approaches for novel IBS drug discovery. The underlying pathologies can be
      tackled locally from the 'outside-in' (intestinal lumen, mucosa and
      neuromuscular) to identify therapeutic targets. The article discusses the
      mechanisms associated with bile acid malabsorption, microbial dysbiosis,
      decreased intestinal barrier function, immune dysregulation, motility and
      visceral hypersensitivity. EXPERT OPINION: Challenges for new drug discovery are 
      the unknown mechanisms underlying IBS, making it difficult to predict clinically 
      efficacious molecular targets, limited options for translational research and
      disease progression biomarkers. Drugs acting locally via multiple targets (e.g., 
      eluxadoline [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Viberzi (eluxadoline)
      for IBS-D on May 27th 2015], crofelemer) to validated mechanisms are proving
      successful with tolerable safety margins. Novel mechanisms, identified and
      optimized based on the emerging role of nutrient signaling, probiotics or
      microbial products, are promising. Therapeutic treatment earlier in disease
      progression may improve response and have longer term benefits.

TI  - Potential role of the intestinal microbiota in programming health and disease.
PG  - 32-40
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuv039 [doi]
AB  - The composition of the microbiota varies according to prenatal events, delivery
      methods, infant feeding, infant care environment, and antibiotic use. Postnatal
      gut function and immune development are largely influenced by the intestinal
      microbiota. Emerging evidence has shown that early microbiota colonization may
      influence the occurrence of later diseases (microbial programming). The vast
      majority of microbial species (commensals) give rise to symbiotic host-bacterial 
      interactions that are fundamental for human health. However, changes in the
      composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may be associated with several
      clinical conditions, including obesity and metabolic diseases, autoimmune
      diseases and allergy, acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and 
      allergic IBS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on recent advances,
      modulation of gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or fermented dairy
      products has been suggested as a treatment of, or prevention for, different
      disorders such as IBS, infectious diarrhea, allergic disease, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis.

TI  - Symbiotics in irritable bowel syndrome--better than probiotics alone?
PG  - 485-9
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000199 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal
      disorder associated with significant physical and psychological comorbidity. The 
      etiology of the condition is uncertain but recent research suggests that the gut 
      bacterial composition may play a role in its development. Therefore, manipulation
      of the intestinal microbiome by using probiotics and symbiotics has the potential
      to improve patient outcomes in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous randomized
      controlled trials suggest a benefit of probiotics in the management of IBS, with 
      a significant reduction in the likelihood of symptoms persisting after therapy,
      and improvements in abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence when probiotics are
      compared with placebo. Evidence for the effect of probiotics on quality of life
      is conflicting. Relatively few randomized controlled trials have examined the
      effect of symbiotics on outcomes in IBS, but results thus far are promising.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in IBS. Data supporting the use of
      symbiotics is sparse. Whether symbiotics are superior to probiotics is unclear.

TI  - Poor predictive value of breath hydrogen response for probiotic effects in IBS.
PG  - 1731-9
LID - 10.1111/jgh.13015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous observations suggested that an early rise in breath
      hydrogen after lactulose (ERBHAL) may identify patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) likely to respond to probiotics. Therefore, we aimed to (i)
      investigate whether treatment with a probiotic changes breath hydrogen response
      in patients with ERBHAL and (ii) whether these changes identify patients who may 
      benefit symptomatically from probiotics. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial, patients with IBS (Rome III) were randomized to either 
      65 mL/day fermented milk product containing probiotic (FMPP) or placebo for 6
      weeks, followed by 6 weeks' open-label treatment and 6 weeks' withdrawal. Breath 
      hydrogen responses to lactulose (15 g) and liquid-gastric emptying time were
      evaluated before and at the end of each treatment period. Symptoms were measured 
      using a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: Loss of ERBHAL occurred in 36% of 23
      patients receiving FMPP and 41% of 22 receiving placebo (P = 1.00). Amongst 40
      patients who completed open-label FMPP treatment, ERBHAL was lost in a further
      38%, continued in 25%, and regained in 10%. Similar variability occurred in the
      withdrawal phase. Variability was unrelated to changes in gastric emptying. No
      differences in symptom response were seen between treatment groups nor in
      relation to the loss or retention of ERBHAL. CONCLUSIONS: Breath hydrogen
      patterns after lactulose are poorly reproducible. No FMPP-specific effects on
      fermentation patterns or symptoms were observed. The presence of ERBHAL is not
      useful to predict symptomatic response to probiotic therapy in patients with IBS.

TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG supernatant upregulates serotonin transporter
      expression in intestinal epithelial cells and mice intestinal tissues.
PG  - 1239-48
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12615 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role that probiotics play in relieving irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) has been demonstrated; however, the mechanism by which IBS is affected
      remains unclear. In this study, serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA and serotonin
      transporter protein (SERT-P) levels in HT-29, Caco-2 cells, and mice intestinal
      tissues were examined after treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG supernatant
      (LGG-s). METHODS: HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were treated with different
      concentrations of LGG-s for 12 and 24 h and C57BL/6 mice received supplements of 
      different concentrations for 4 weeks. SERT mRNA and SERT-P levels were detected
      by real-time PCR and Western blotting. KEY RESULTS: SERT mRNA and SERT-P levels
      in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were higher than those in the control 24 h after
      treatment. Undiluted LGG-s upregulated SERT mRNA levels by 9.4-fold in the first 
      week, which dropped in the second week. The double-diluted LGG-s upregulated SERT
      mRNA by 2.07-fold in the first week; levels dropped to 1.75-fold within the
      second week and under base expression levels by the third week, while they again 
      climbed to 1.56-fold in the fourth week. The triple-diluted LGG-s could not
      upregulate SERT mRNA expression until the end of the fourth week. The SERT-P
      levels in the double-diluted LGG-s group were higher than that in the control but
      fluctuated with time. SERT-P levels in the triple-diluted LGG-s were higher than 
      that in the control in the last 2 weeks and increased with time. CONCLUSIONS &
      INFERENCES: LGG-s can upregulate SERT mRNA and SERT-P levels in intestinal
      epithelial cells and mice intestinal tissues.

TI  - [A meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 445-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics to treat irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Publications from database including PubMed, the
      Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, CBM and WanFang Data were searched up to August
      31, 2014. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on probiotics to treat IBS were
      eligible. The related articles were extracted and cross-checked independently by 
      two reviewers. Methodological quality of trials was evaluated according to
      Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.2
      software. RESULTS: A total of 17 RCTs involving 1 700 patients were included.
      Results of meta-analyses showed that compared with the placebo, probiotics was
      statistically better in improving the overall symptoms integral (SMD = -0.20, 95%
      CI -0.33--0.07, P = 0.002), alleviating abdominal pain/discomfort (SMD = -0.19,
      95% CI -0.29--0.09, P<0.001), relieving abdominal distention (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI
      -0.28--0.03, P = 0.020), and defecation discomfort (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI
      -0.42--0.02, P = 0.030). There was no statistical significance in the overall
      quality of life (SMD = -0.08, 95% CI -0.07-0.23, P = 0.290) and adverse effect
      ratio (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.79-1.49, P = 0.630). CONCLUSION: Probiotics have
      beneficial effects on IBS, which can improve the patients' symptoms and with less
      adverse reaction. Due to the bias, further large-scale, multicenter and
      high-quality RCTs are required to unify outcome indicators, further define
      sensitive strain, and standardize its usage, dosage and course of treatment.

AB  - UNLABELLED: There is little data on the long term evolution of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and of associated conditions. We therefore studied
      the evolution of IBS patients in a single tertiary center during a long interval 
      of time. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study based on the survey of
      patients records. We analyzed the records of symptoms, therapy, associated
      diseases, as consigned at follow-up visits for an interval of 4 years in average 
      (2008-2011). RESULTS: A cohort of 114 patients with IBS diagnosed based on Rome
      III criteria were included (29 men and 85 women), age 19-85 years (mean age:
      43.45 years). Urban patients were predominant. The main three symptoms were:
      abdominal pain, bowel disorders (constipation, diarrhea) and bloating.
      IBS--constipation (IBS--C) is associated with a favorable course of symptoms
      (increasing the number of stools, decrease intensity of abdominal pain and
      bloating) after treatment and IBS--diarrhea (IBS--D) is associated with variable 
      symptoms after treatment (p = 0.031). Using trimebutin or mebeverin in
      association with other drugs for one month correlates with a favorable evolution 
      of symptoms after treatment and monotherapy is associated with fluctuating
      symptoms ( p< 0.001). Favorable symptoms are associated with the use of
      probiotics in combination, but not in monotherapy (p< 0.001). Favorable evolution
      of symptoms is also associated with the use of anxiolytics in combination.
      Persistence of symptoms after treatment was correlated with the presence or
      absence of depression. The absence of depression was correlated with a favorable 
      evolution of symptoms (p = 0.005). IBS-C is associated at limit (marginal
      significance) with hemorrhoidal disease (p = 0.56). 33 patients (29%)--received
      monotherapy (trimebutin or mebeverin or probiotics); 81 patients (71%)--received 
      combined therapy: (trimebutin or mebeverin or probiotics) + anxiolytics or proton
      pump inhibitors (PPI) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) or spasmolytics.
      The most common associated diseases observed in patients with IBS were:
      depression (27.19%), dyslipidemia (25.43%), hemorrhoidal disease (22.80%) and
      fibromyalgia (21%). CONCLUSIONS: The highest response rate was obtained with
      trimebutin or mebeverin + anxiolitics + probiotics. The most frequent disease
      associated with IBS was depression. Other diseases with a high incidence:
      dyslipidemia, hemorrhoidal disease and fibromyalgia. Further studies are needed
      to analyze the link between IBS and some associated diseases.

AB  - The gut microbiota has a significant role in human health and disease. Dysbiosis 
      of the intestinal ecosystem contributes to the development of certain illnesses
      that can be reversed by favorable alterations by probiotics. The published
      literature was reviewed to identify scientific data showing a relationship
      between imbalance of gut bacteria and development of diseases that can be
      improved by biologic products. The medical conditions vary from infectious and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea to obesity to chronic neurologic disorders. A
      number of controlled clinical trials have been performed to show important
      biologic effects in a number of these conditions through administration of
      prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics. Controlled clinical trials have
      identified a limited number of prebiotics, probiotic strains, and synbiotics that
      favorably prevent or improve the symptoms of various disorders including
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
      necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants, and hepatic
      encephalopathy. Studies have shown that probiotics alter gut flora and lead to
      elaboration of flora metabolites that influence health through 1 of 3 general
      mechanisms: direct antimicrobial effects, enhancement of mucosal barrier
      integrity, and immune modulation. Restoring the balance of intestinal flora by
      introducing probiotics for disease prevention and treatment could be beneficial
      to human health. It is also clear that significant differences exist between
      different probiotic species. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics together with
      bioinformatics have allowed us to study the cross-talk between the gut microbiota
      and the host, furthering insight into the next generation of biologic products.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial functional disorder with no
      clearly defined etiology or pathophysiology. Modern culture-independent
      techniques have improved the understanding of the gut microbiota's composition
      and demonstrated that an altered gut microbiota profile might be found in at
      least some subgroups of IBS patients. Research on IBS from a microbial
      perspective is gaining momentum and advancing. This review will therefore
      highlight potential links between the gut microbiota and IBS by discussing the
      current knowledge of the gut microbiota; it will also illustrate bacterial-host
      interactions and how alterations to these interactions could exacerbate, induce
      or even help alleviate IBS.

AB  - New insights from a rapidly developing field of research have ushered in a new
      era of understanding of the complexity of host-microbe interactions within the
      human body. The paradigm shift from culturing to metagenomics has provided an
      insight into the complex diversity of the microbial species that we harbor,
      revealing the fact that we are in fact more microbes than human cells. The
      largest consortium of these microbes resides in the gut and is called the gut
      microbiota. This new science has expanded the ability to document shifts in
      microbial populations to an unparalleled degree. It is now understood that
      signals from the microbiota provide trophic, nutritional, metabolic, and
      protective effects for the development and maintenance of the host digestive,
      immune, and neuroendocrine system. Evidence linking changes in the gut microbiota
      to gastrointestinal and extraintestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, 
      inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and celiac disease have begun to
      emerge recently. Probiotics act through diverse mechanisms positively affecting
      the composition and/or function of the commensal microbiota and alter host
      immunological responses. Well-controlled intervention trials, systematic reviews,
      and meta-analysis provide convincing evidence for the benefit of probiotics in
      prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal as well as extraintestinal
      disorders.

LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0022-3 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that
      is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits 
      and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent
      developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of
      IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food
      allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new 
      diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that
      triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS
      appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a
      gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly
      absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and
      insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and
      insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and
      provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production,
      abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble
      fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. 
      Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the
      abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal
      endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake
      are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would
      expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain.
      However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual
      dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in
      combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for 
      IBS patients.

AB  - AIM: To establish the rate of lactase deficiency (LD) in patients with
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), to define a role of enteric
      bacteria in the pathogenesis of hypolactasia, and to evaluate the efficiency of
      probiotic therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Examinations were made in 386 patients
      with PI-IBS, including 112 (79.4%) women; mean age 33.9 +/- 9.1 years; disease
      duration 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. Rapid tests of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) biopsy
      specimens obtained from the duodenal retrobulbar segment were used to diagnose
      LD. Bacterial growth was estimated by a hydrogen breath test using a H2 MICRO gas
      analyzer. RESULTS: The patients with PI-IBS were revealed to have moderate and
      severe LD in 25.6 and 10.9%, respectively. All the patients with LD were detected
      to have small intestinal (SI) bacterial overgrowth (BOG). An inverse correlation 
      was found between LD and the degree of SI BOG (r = -0.53; p < 0.001). 73.7% of
      the patients with moderate LD showed a positive effect of probiotic therapy as
      regression of clinical symptoms of LD, a decrease of hydrogen levels in expired
      air from 72.4 +/- 25.1 to 16.41 +/- 3.2 ppm (p < 0.05), an increase of lactate
      activity in the SIM biopsy specimens and an improvement of quality of life from
      2.69 +/- 0.53 to 5.53 +/- 0.64 scores according to the GCI scale. No improvement 
      occurred in 73.8% of the patients with severe LD. CONCLUSION: LD was identified
      in 36.5% of the patients with PI-IBS. There was an inverse correlation between
      the degree of LD and SI BOG. The good therapeutic effect of probiotics in LD
      suggests that the symbiotic gut microflora positively affects the activity of
      lactase in the human SIM. No therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with
      severe LN serves as the basis for a search for more active probiotic therapy.

LID - 10.17116/terarkh20158724-10 [doi]
AB  - The paper analyzes an evidence base for the pharmacotherapy of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) A large number of randomized placebo-controlled trials (RPCTs)
      systematized in a number of meta-analyses suggest that monotherapy regimens with 
      spasmolytics, antidepressants, dietary fibers, polyethylene glycol, rifaximin,
      probiotics, and mesalamine are effective. Only some RPCTs evaluate the efficiency
      of combined pharmacotherapy versus placebo for IBS. Since the basis for the
      pathophysiology of the latter is motility and functional disorders, visceral
      hypersensitivity, and, probably, impaired microbiota, we anticipate that the need
      to use combined approaches to treating the majority of patients with IBS, by
      covering a few components of its pathogenesis, is relevant. Thus, to choose
      pharmacotherapy for IBS in each specific case is a challenge as this is
      determined by the form of IBS, the availability of an approved medicine on the
      domestic market, the indications for use, possible long-term use, high safety,
      and efficacy evidence drawn from RPCTs.

LID - 10.7748/ns.29.32.49.e9571 [doi]
AB  - Constipation is a common, often chronic, condition that is a health concern for
      providers of care. The condition can be distressing and although seldom
      life-threatening can lead to patient discomfort and debilitating effects on
      patients' quality of life. Initial management of chronic constipation should
      include lifestyle changes and increased fibre and fluids. More active
      interventions include the use of laxatives and other medications, irrigation and 
      biofeedback therapy. Some patients may require surgery. This article provides an 
      overview of the strategies used to prevent constipation in adults as well as the 
      possible treatment options available.

TI  - Efficacy of combination therapy with probiotics and mosapride in patients with
      IBS without diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter, phase II trial.
PG  - 705-16
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics can be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Mosapride citrate, a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist, stimulates
      gastrointestinal motility. We investigated the efficacy of combination therapy
      with probiotics and mosapride for non-diarrheal-type IBS. METHODS: Two hundred
      and eighty-five IBS patients were randomly assigned to either a combination of
      probiotics (Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecium) and mosapride at one of 
      four different doses or a placebo for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the
      proportion of patients experiencing adequate relief (AR) of global IBS symptoms
      at week 4. The secondary outcomes included subject's global assessment (SGA) of
      IBS symptom relief, individual symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS-quality of
      life. KEY RESULTS: The proportion of AR at week 4 was significantly higher in all
      treatment groups compared to the placebo group (53.7% in group 1, 55.0% in group 
      2, 55.2% in group 3, 53.6% in group 4 [the highest dose], and 35.1% in placebo
      group, respectively, p < 0.05). The proportion of patients reporting 'completely 
      or considerably relieved' in the SGA was higher in the treatment groups than in
      the placebo group. The abdominal pain/discomfort score in the treatment group 4
      was more prominently improved compared with that of the placebo group. In
      patients with constipation-predominant IBS, the improvements in stool frequency
      and consistency were significantly higher in the treatment groups 4 and 1,
      respectively, than those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES:
      Combination therapy with probiotics and mosapride is effective for relief of
      symptoms in patients with non-diarrheal-type IBS. The study has been registered
      in the US National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,
      NCT01505777).

TI  - The use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature
      and recommendations by Latin-American experts.
PG  - 199-216
LID - 10.1007/s40272-015-0124-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role
      in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50
      years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic
      administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a
      recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology,
      together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits,
      tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without
      study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled
      studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics,
      diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea,
      bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter
      pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the 
      quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence
      were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the
      updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of
      RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort
      studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for
      SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert
      group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric
      gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b
      for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri;
      prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and
      Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for
      L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S.
      boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of 
      infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b
      for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of
      Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; 
      induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3;
      improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the efficacy of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
      patients. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus, Google Scholar, and
      Clinicaltrial.gov databases were searched for literature published between
      September 2007 and December 2013. The applied Mesh terms were "probiotics,"
      "irritable bowel syndrome," and "irritable bowel syndrome treatment." The
      collected data contained24 clinical trials, of which 15 were eligible for
      meta-analysis and nine were reviewed systematically. All studies were randomized 
      placebo-controlled trials in patients with IBS that investigated the efficacy of 
      probiotics in IBS improvement. The Jadad score was used to assess the
      methodological quality of trials. The quality scale ranges from 0 to 5 points,
      with a score </= 2 indicating a low quality report, and a score of >/= 3
      indicating a high quality report. Relative risk (RR), standardized effect size,
      and 95%CI were calculated using the DerSimonian-Laird method. The Cochran Q test 
      was used to test heterogeneity with P < 0.05. Funnel plots were constructed and
      Egger's and Begg-Mazumdar tests were performed to assess publication bias.
      RESULTS: A total of 1793 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The RR of
      responders to therapies based on abdominal pain score in IBS patients for two
      included trials comparing probiotics to placebo was 1.96 (95%CI: 1.14-3.36; P =
      0.01). RR of responders to therapies based on a global symptom score in IBS
      patients for two included trials comparing probiotics with placebo was 2.43
      (95%CI: 1.13-5.21; P = 0.02). For adequate improvement of general symptoms in IBS
      patients, the RR of seven included trials (six studies) comparing probiotics with
      placebo was 2.14 (95%CI: 1.08-4.26; P = 0.03). Distension, bloating, and
      flatulence were evaluated using an IBS severity scoring system in three trials
      (two studies) to compare the effect of probiotic therapy in IBS patients with
      placebo, the standardized effect size of mean differences for probiotics therapy 
      was -2.57 (95%CI: -13.05--7.92). CONCLUSION: Probiotics reduce pain and symptom
      severity scores. The results demonstrate the beneficial effects of probiotics in 
      IBS patients in comparison with placebo.

TI  - Gastroenterology issues in schizophrenia: why the gut matters.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1007/s11920-015-0574-0 [doi]
AB  - Genetic and environmental studies implicate immune pathologies in schizophrenia. 
      The body's largest immune organ is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Historical
      associations of GI conditions with mental illnesses predate the introduction of
      antipsychotics. Current studies of antipsychotic-naive patients support that gut 
      dysfunction may be inherent to the schizophrenia disease process. Risk factors
      for schizophrenia (inflammation, food intolerances, Toxoplasma gondii exposure,
      cellular barrier defects) are part of biological pathways that intersect those
      operant in the gut. Central to GI function is a homeostatic microbial community, 
      and early reports show that it is disrupted in schizophrenia. Bioactive and toxic
      products derived from digestion and microbial dysbiosis activate adaptive and
      innate immunity. Complement C1q, a brain-active systemic immune component,
      interacts with gut-related schizophrenia risk factors in clinical and
      experimental animal models. With accumulating evidence supporting newly
      discovered gut-brain physiological pathways, treatments to ameliorate brain
      symptoms of schizophrenia should be supplemented with therapies to correct GI
      dysfunction.

      meta-analysis.
PG  - 243-9
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.2710 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As the lack of reliable treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      prompts interest in the development of new therapies, we aimed to systematically 
      evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus in treating this disease. METHODS: We
      searched MEDLIINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials for the period from 1966 to August 2013 for
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of
      Lactobacillus treatment in the management of IBS. The studies were screened for
      inclusion based on randomization, controls and reported measurable outcomes. We
      used the Jadad score to assess the quality of the articles. The STATA 11.0 and
      Revman 5.0 software packages were used for the meta-analysis. The STATA 11.0
      software program was also used to assess indicators of publication bias according
      to Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: Six randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
      trials met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The Jadad score
      of the articles was >3, and three articles were of high quality. We analyzed the 
      heterogeneity of the studies and found no heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In 
      the forest plot, the diamond was on the right side of the vertical line and did
      not intersect with the line. The pooled relative risk for clinical improvement
      with Lactobacillus treatment was 7.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.33-25.43,
      p=0.0008). For adults, the pooled relative risk for clinical improvement with
      Lactobacillus treatment was 17.62 (95% confidence interval: 5.12-60.65,
      p<0.00001). For children, the pooled relative risk for clinical improvement with 
      Lactobacillus treatment was 3.71 (95% confidence interval:1.05-13.11, p=0.04).
      Using the STATA 10.0 and Revman 5.0 software programs, we confirmed that
      Lactobacillus exhibited significant efficacy in treating IBS. CONCLUSION:
      Compared with the placebo, Lactobacillus treatment was found to be associated
      with a significantly higher rate of treatment responders in the overall
      population with IBS, without any side effects. As to limitations of the analysis,
      additional research is needed.

TI  - Evaluation of the probiotic properties of new Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
      strains and their in vitro effect.
PG  - 5613-26
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6482-8 [doi]
AB  - Probiotic ingestion is recommended as a preventive approach to maintain the
      balance of the intestinal microbiota and to enhance the human well-being. During 
      the whole life of each individual, the gut microbiota composition could be
      altered by lifestyle, diet, antibiotic therapies and other stress conditions,
      which may lead to acute and chronic disorders. Hence, probiotics can be
      administered for the prevention or treatment of some disorders, including lactose
      malabsorption, acute diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing
      enterocolitis and mild forms of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      probiotic-mediated effect is an important issue that needs to be addressed in
      relation to strain-specific probiotic properties. In this work, the probiotic
      properties of new Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were screened, and
      their effects in vitro were evaluated. They were screened for probiotic
      properties by determining their tolerance to low pH and to bile salts, antibiotic
      sensitivity, antimicrobial activity and vitamin B8, B9 and B12 production, and by
      considering their ability to increase the antioxidant potential and to modulate
      the inflammatory status of systemic-miming cell lines in vitro. Three out of the 
      examined strains presenting the most performant probiotic properties, as
      Lactobacillus plantarum PBS067, Lactobacillus rhamnosus PBS070 and
      Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis PBSO75, were evaluated for their effects
      also on human intestinal HT-29 cell line. The obtained results support the
      possibility to move to another level of study, that is, the oral administration
      of these probiotical strains to patients with acute and chronic gut disorders, by
      in vivo experiments.

AB  - Tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the bidirectional
      interactions between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and 
      the gastrointestinal tract. A series of provocative preclinical studies have
      suggested a prominent role for the gut microbiota in these gut-brain
      interactions. Based on studies using rodents raised in a germ-free environment,
      the gut microbiota appears to influence the development of emotional behavior,
      stress- and pain-modulation systems, and brain neurotransmitter systems.
      Additionally, microbiota perturbations by probiotics and antibiotics exert
      modulatory effects on some of these measures in adult animals. Current evidence
      suggests that multiple mechanisms, including endocrine and neurocrine pathways,
      may be involved in gut microbiota-to-brain signaling and that the brain can in
      turn alter microbial composition and behavior via the autonomic nervous system.
      Limited information is available on how these findings may translate to healthy
      humans or to disease states involving the brain or the gut/brain axis. Future
      research needs to focus on confirming that the rodent findings are translatable
      to human physiology and to diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, autism,
      anxiety, depression, and Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Nonpharmacologic treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 522-35
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-2123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Various nonpharmacologic treatments are available for
      pediatric abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (AP-FGIDs). Data on efficacy and safety are scarce. The goal of this study was to
      summarize the evidence regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric
      AP-FGIDs: lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, behavioral
      interventions, prebiotics and probiotics, and alternative medicine. METHODS:
      Searches were conducted of the Medline and Cochrane Library databases. Systematic
      reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning nonpharmacologic
      therapies in children (aged 3-18 years) with AP-FGIDs were included, and data
      were extracted on participants, interventions, and outcomes. The quality of
      evidence was assessed by using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs were
      found that included 1390 children. Significant improvement of abdominal pain was 
      reported after hypnotherapy compared with standard care/wait-list approaches and 
      after cognitive behavioral therapy compared with a variety of control
      treatments/wait-list approaches. Written self-disclosure improved pain frequency 
      at the 6-month follow-up only. Compared with placebo, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG 
      (LGG) and VSL#3 were associated with significantly more treatment responders (LGG
      relative risk: 1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.59]; VSL#3: P < .05).
      Guar gum significantly improved irritable bowel syndrome symptom frequency;
      however, no effect was found for other fiber supplements (relative risk: 1.17
      [95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.81]) or a lactose-free diet. Functional
      disability was not significantly decreased after yoga compared with a wait-list
      approach. No studies were found concerning lifestyle interventions; gluten-,
      histamine-, or carbonic acid-free diets; fluid intake; or prebiotics. No serious 
      adverse effects were reported. The quality of evidence was found to be very low
      to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Although high-quality studies are lacking, some
      evidence shows efficacy of hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
      probiotics (LGG and VSL#3) in pediatric AP-FGIDs. Data on fiber supplements are
      inconclusive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors may foster intestinal dysbiosis and related
      bowel symptoms. AIM: To evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei F19 on
      bowel symptom onset in patients on long-term proton pump inhibitors. METHODS: In 
      this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with typical
      gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms receiving pantoprazole 40 mg/d for six
      months were randomly assigned to receive: (A) Lactobacillus paracasei F19 bid for
      three days/week for six months; (B) placebo bid for three days/week for six
      months; (C) Lactobacillus paracasei F19 bid for three days/week for three months 
      and placebo bid for three days/week for the following three months; (D) placebo
      bid for three days/week for three months and Lactobacillus paracasei F19 bid for 
      three days/week for the following three months. Bloating, flatulence, abdominal
      pain and bowel habit were assessed monthly. RESULTS: 100/312 patients were
      enrolled. In the parallel groups, the treatment-by-time interaction affected
      bloating (p = 0.015), while Lactobacillus paracasei F19 treatment alone affected 
      flatulence (p = 0.011). Moreover, the treatment-by-time interaction significantly
      affected the mean score of bloating (p = 0.01) and flatulence (p < 0.0001), the
      mean stool form (p = 0.03) and mean stool frequency/week (p = 0.016). Analysis of
      the cross-over groups, limited to the first three months because of carry-over
      effect, confirmed these results. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus paracasei F19
      supplementation prevents bowel symptom onset in patients on long-term proton pump
      inhibitors.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain and
      altered bowel habits. This common disorder is managed by varying clinical styles 
      as no dominant therapeutic strategy has emerged. The pathophysiology of IBS
      remains unknown, but several lines of evidence link this disorder with the gut
      microbiota. Although controversy exists, gut microbiota is likely contributing to
      symptoms of IBS, at least in some patients, through an altered fermentation
      process, an impaired intestinal barrier function, a harmful modulation of enteric
      sensorimotor function, a promotion of low-grade inflammation without tissue
      damage, and a harmful modulation of the brain-gut axis. Probiotic therapy has a
      modest effect on IBS symptomatic relief, but the actual evidence is not strong
      enough to support a general recommendation of use. The best results are achieved,
      in children, with Lactobacillus rhamnusus GG, which moderately improves abdominal
      pain, while in adults the benefit appears to be greatest employing
      Bifidobacterium species.

AB  - Probiotics are used in a great number of both paediatric and adult diseases,
      mainly in gastrointestinal disorders, like diarrhoea. Nevertheless, their
      beneficial effect on immune alterations, such as atopic dermatitis and, more
      recently, in women related diseases such as vulvovaginitis and mastitis have also
      been observed. However, the use of probiotics is not completely implemented into 
      the routine clinical practice for primary care physicians. There is still a great
      controversy with scarce scientific evidence, due to the diversity in the designs 
      thereof which justifies the variability in the efficacy results. This outcome
      leads to difficulties in developing definitive treatment guidelines although
      there are exceptions, for example, WGO. The aim of this workshop, held at the VI 
      Congress of the Spanish Society of Probiotics and Prebiotics is the training of
      primary care physicians, both paediatricians and general practitioners in the
      clinical applications of these nutritional preparations in different diseases:
      acute diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      employment in infant milk formulas, infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome and
      inflammatory bowel disease, as well as vulvovaginitis and mastitis.

AB  - Nowadays, publications on probiotics have increased exponentially. However they
      usually are heterogeneous, use diverse strains and doses, and different outcomes,
      making it difficult to generalize their results. On the basis of the currently
      available literature, the use of probiotics is supported in the following
      diseases: acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis and inflammatory bowel disease (particularly 
      pouchitis). This paper provides an update of the potential role of probiotics in 
      gastrointestinal diseases, in both pediatric and adult patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: of review Those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have long
      reported the frequent precipitation of their symptoms in relation to food
      ingestion and have often been convinced that certain foods were especially
      problematic. However, until very recently, research on the responses to food or
      individual dietary constituents, in IBS, has been scarce. This review addresses
      recent literature on diet and IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: The complexity of
      food-symptom interactions in IBS is being revealed in recent and ongoing
      research. Such studies have revealed the variable effects of fibre in IBS and the
      susceptibility of IBS individuals to the ingestion of poorly digested and
      absorbed carbohydrates. The latter has led to the widespread adoption of the
      low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols
      (FODMAPs) diet. Less certain is the role of another widely adopted dietary
      strategy, gluten restriction. Diet-microbe interactions are critical to the
      homeostasis of the gut microbiome in health and may well be disturbed in disease;
      enthusiasm continues, therefore, for the use of probiotics in IBS. SUMMARY: Food 
      is a common precipitant of symptoms in IBS and recent research has focused on the
      role(s) of individual dietary constituents in IBS and on fibre, FODMAPs, gluten
      and probiotics, in particular. Each may have a role in certain IBS sufferers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Food is a recognized trigger for most patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). In recent years, an emerging evidence base has identified dietary
      manipulation as an important therapeutic approach in IBS. SOURCES OF DATA:
      Original and review articles were identified through selective searches performed
      on PubMed and Google Scholar. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Randomized controlled trials
      have supported the use of a diet that restricts a group of short-chain
      carbohydrates known collectively as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, 
      monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). There is evidence that specific probiotics
      may improve symptoms in IBS. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The role of a high-fibre diet 
      remains subject to ongoing debate with a lack of high-quality evidence. The
      long-term durability and safety of a low FODMAP diet are unclear. GROWING POINTS:
      A paradigm shift has led to a focus on the relationship between diet and
      pathophysiological mechanisms in IBS such as effects on intestinal microbiota,
      inflammation, motility, permeability and visceral hypersensitivity. AREAS TIMELY 
      FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Future large, randomized controlled trials with rigorous
      end points are required. In addition, predictors of response need to be
      identified to offer personalized therapy.

AB  - Impaired gut barrier function has been reported in a wide range of diseases and
      syndromes and in some functional gastrointestinal disorders. In addition, there
      is increasing evidence that suggests the gut microbiota tightly regulates gut
      barrier function and recent studies demonstrate that probiotic bacteria can
      enhance barrier integrity. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 on intestinal barrier function. In vitro
      results using a Caco-2 monolayer cells stimulated with TNF-alpha confirmed the
      anti-inflammatory nature of the strain CNCM I-3690 and pointed out a putative
      role for the protection of the epithelial function. Next, we tested the
      protective effects of L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 in a mouse model of increased
      colonic permeability. Most importantly, we compared its performance to that of
      the well-known beneficial human commensal bacterium Faecalibacterium prauznitzii 
      A2-165. Increased colonic permeability was normalized by both strains to a
      similar degree. Modulation of apical tight junction proteins expression was then 
      analyzed to decipher the mechanism underlying this effect. We showed that CNCM
      I-3690 partially restored the function of the intestinal barrier and increased
      the levels of tight junction proteins Occludin and E-cadherin. The results
      indicate L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 is as effective as the commensal
      anti-inflammatory bacterium F. prausnitzii to treat functional barrier
      abnormalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate clinical symptoms in subjects with irritable
      bowel syndrome receiving Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Overall, 179 adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome (Rome III criteria) were randomized to receive once daily 500 mg
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, delivered by one capsule (n = 86, F: 84%, age: 42.5 
      +/- 12.5), or placebo (n = 93, F: 88%, age: 45.4 +/- 14) for 8 weeks followed by 
      a 3-week washout period. After a 2-week run-in period, cardinal symptoms
      (abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distension, bowel movement difficulty) and
      changes in stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily and assessed each 
      week. A safety assessment was carried out throughout the study. RESULTS: The
      proportion of responders, defined by an improvement of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      was significantly higher (p = 0.04) in the treated group than the placebo group
      (63% vs 47%, OR = 1.88, 95%, CI: 0.99-3.57) in the last 4 weeks of treatment. A
      non-significant trend of improvement was observed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      for the other symptoms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was well tolerated and did not
      affect stool frequency and consistency. CONCLUSION: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
      well tolerated and reduces abdominal pain/discomfort scores without stool
      modification. Thus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be a new promising candidate for
      improving abdominal pain in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.

LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0067 [doi]
AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

      evidence synthesis concerning management of IBS in the last five years, with
      guidelines for its management in primary care published by the National Institute
      for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional
      web-based questionnaire survey of 275 primary care physicians. We emailed a link 
      to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire, containing 18 items, to all eligible primary
      care physicians registered with three clinical commissioning groups in Leeds, UK.
      Participants were given one month to respond, with a reminder sent out after two 
      weeks. FINDINGS: One-hundred and two (37.1%) primary care physicians responded.
      Among responders, 70% believed IBS was a diagnosis of exclusion, and >80% checked
      coeliac serology often or always in suspected IBS. Between >50% and >70% believed
      soluble fibre, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and psychological therapies were
      potentially efficacious therapies. The respondents were less convinced that
      antidepressants or probiotics were effective. Despite perceived efficacy of
      psychological therapies, 80% stated these were not easily available. Levels of
      use of soluble fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were in the range of 40%
      to >50%. Most primary care physicians obtained up-to-date evidence about IBS
      management from NICE guidelines. Most primary care physicians still believe IBS
      is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many are reluctant to use antidepressants or
      probiotics to treat IBS. More research studies addressing diagnosis and treatment
      of IBS based in primary are required.

TI  - General practitioners roles and experiences with functional foods containing
      probiotics and plant sterols.
PG  - 254-62
LID - 10.1017/S1463423614000280 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this research is to explore whether general practitioners
      have experiences with functional foods within their clinical practice.
      BACKGROUND: Previous research and editorials have suggested that general
      practitioners should have more involvement and knowledge of functional foods.
      This is due to the thought that functional foods may be consumed by their
      patients that could lead to other issues, such as patients not taking their
      medication. Therefore, research into general practitioners involvement with
      functional foods needs to be conducted. METHOD: In all, 10 semi-structured open
      interviews were used with a topic guide. These interviews where digitally audio
      recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts where analysed using thematic 
      analysis. FINDINGS: It was found that general practitioners believed they did not
      have a direct role with functional foods and should not be involved with
      discussing them with their patients. They felt that if they where to be involved 
      with functional foods then they would need more training and information about
      them. They also felt that functional foods could be empowering for their
      patients.

TI  - Melatonin regulation as a possible mechanism for probiotic (VSL#3) in irritable
      bowel syndrome: a randomized double-blinded placebo study.
PG  - 186-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3299-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have treatment efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      but the exact mechanism remains obscure. One hypothesis is the mediation of
      melatonin levels, leading to changes in IBS symptoms. AIM: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic, VSL#3, on symptoms,
      psychological and sleep parameters, and pain sensitivity in IBS, and relate these
      parameters to in vivo melatonin levels. METHODS: Forty-two IBS patients were
      randomly assigned to receive VSL#3 or placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects completed
      bowel and psychological questionnaires, underwent rectal sensitivity testing and 
      saliva melatonin assays. RESULTS: Abdominal pain duration and distension
      intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic group, along with an increase 
      in rectal distension pain thresholds. A correlation between increase in pain
      tolerance and improvement in abdominal pain scores (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) was seen 
      with probiotic. There was an increase in salivary morning melatonin levels in
      males treated with VSL#3, which correlated (r = 0.61) with improved satisfaction 
      in bowel habits. When grouped based on baseline diurnal melatonin levels,
      patients with normal diurnal fluctuations showed an increase in morning melatonin
      levels with VSL#3 treatment, which significantly correlated with improved
      satisfaction in bowel habits (r = 0.68). They also had reduced symptom severity
      scores and abdominal pain duration when treated with VSL#3, as well as
      satisfaction with bowel movements and quality-of-life. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3
      improved symptoms and increased rectal pain thresholds. Symptom improvement
      correlated with a rise in morning melatonin, significant in males and subjects
      with normal circadian rhythm. This suggests that probiotics may act by
      influencing melatonin production, hence modulating IBS symptoms, in individuals
      with a normal circadian rhythm.
