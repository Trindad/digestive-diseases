TI  - Current level of consensus on probiotic science--report of an expert
      meeting--London, 23 November 2009.

AB  - The present paper summarizes the consensus views of a group of 9 European
      clinicians and scientists on the current state of scientific knowledge on
      probiotics, covering those areas where there is substantial evidence for
      beneficial effects and those where the evidence base is poor or inconsistent.
      There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain 
      specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the 
      incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile
      infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in
      irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can 
      reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature
      infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other
      clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel
      disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori 
      adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel
      syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are
      reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of
      medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of
      lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to
      provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to
      treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom
      endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles 
      published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome',
      'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre',
      'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone',
      'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine',
      hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative
      entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide',
      'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated
      for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for
      explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of
      abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete
      evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are
      reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified
      58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS
      symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies
      suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements,
      lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor
      inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine,
      octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is
      the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various
      pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific
      symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to
      better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult
      syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous meta-analyses have recently assessed the overall clinical
      benefit of single therapy options and groups of therapies in the irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). By large, this should enable physicians to select from a number
      of therapy options available. METHODS: We entered dichotomous outcome data from
      121 IBS trials published over the last 35 years with different groups and
      subgroups of drugs (antispasmodics, motility-affecting agents, antidepressants,
      peppermint oil), dietary interventions (bran, probiotics), and psychotherapy
      (cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, hypnotherapy, relaxation techniques) into
      meta-analytic tools and estimate the overall efficacy (odds ratio, number needed 
      to treat). RESULTS: Highest efficacy is currently found for peppermint oil,
      followed by psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions and
      probiotics. Traditional antispasmodic therapy has a moderate efficacy, whereas
      the list of (partially failed or cancelled) motility affecting drugs yielded weak
      clinical results, and therapies by bran and fibers are of no value in IBS.
      CONCLUSION: Evidence-based therapy in IBS provides a number of effective
      treatment options beyond the fact that many novel compounds under development
      have failed to reach the market. An algorithm for clinical therapy decision is
      proposed.

PG  - 3638-45
AB  - Current treatment options for the chronic gastrointestinal disorder irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) have long been limited to symptomatic treatments due to lack
      of pathophysiologic understanding of the syndrome. Within the past 10 years,
      however, a number of new pharmacological targets have been identified that may
      aid in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Although only a limited number 
      of new drug entities have entered the market in the past years, many new
      potential pharmacophores are evolving. Among them, several drugs are in the
      pipeline that target cholecystokinin or corticotropin-releasing factor receptors,
      serve as inhibitors for specific tryptophan hydroxylase iso-enzymes, modulate
      chloride secretion, influence immune responses via monoclonal antibodies or
      ATP-mediated pathways, and even normalize the gastrointestinal microflora via
      supplementation with probiotics. While new treatments that act via chloride
      secretion and immune modulation present with favorable outcomes in clinical
      trials, other novel therapies require further evaluation. This review is intended
      to provide a synopsis of current and emerging pharmacotherapies for IBS.

AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

PG  - e1445-52
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-0467 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)
      relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or
      functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center.
      Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and
      received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry 
      and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal
      permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused 
      a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of
      abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up 
      (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved 
      in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P
      < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At
      entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability 
      test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of
      patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P <
      .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG
      significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children
      with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut
      barrier.

      this beneficial interaction between the flora and humans is the manner in which
      the bacteria contained within the gut "talk" to the immune system and, in
      particular, the immune system that is widespread within the gut itself, the gut- 
      (or mucosa-) associated lymphoid tissue (GALT or MALT). Into this landscape comes
      a new player: the probiotic. While many products have masqueraded as probiotics, 
      only those that truly and reproducibly contain live organisms and have been
      shown, in high-quality human studies, to confer a health benefit can actually
      claim this title. Several human disease states have benefited from the use of
      probiotics, most notably diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases,
      and certain infectious disorders. Irritable bowel syndrome can now be added to
      this list. Although this area holds much promise, more high-quality trials of
      probiotics in digestive disorders, as well as laboratory investigations of their 
      mechanisms of action, are required.

AB  - The effects of a probiotic acidified milk product on the blood serum metabolite
      profile of patients suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) compared to a
      non-probiotic acidified milk product was investigated using (1)H NMR
      metabonomics. For eight weeks, IBS patients consumed 0.4 L per day of a probiotic
      fermented milk product or non-probiotic acidified milk. Both diets resulted in
      elevated levels of blood serum L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Our results
      showed identical effects of acidified milk consumption independent of probiotic
      addition. A similar result was previously obtained in a questionnaire-based
      evaluation of symptom relief. A specific probiotic effect is thus absent both in 
      the patient subjective symptom evaluations and at the blood serum metabolite
      level. However, there was no correspondence between symptom relief and metabolite
      response on the patient level.

TI  - Should military dining facilities offer and promote consumption of
      probiotic-containing foods?
PG  - 770-83
AB  - Probiotics are defined as "live organisms which, when administered in adequate
      amounts confer a benefit on the host." The purpose of this review was to
      determine whether there is evidence-based justification to recommend purchase and
      promotion of probiotic-containing food in military dining facilities (DFACs).
      Peer-reviewed literature was searched to identify well-conducted systematic
      reviews and original research related to the efficacy of probiotics in preventing
      and/or treating acute infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory 
      tract infections, allergic rhinitis, dental health issues, and female urogenital 
      conditions. Probiotics may be useful for preventing and/or treating
      military-relevant health conditions. However, the available scientific evidence
      is not sufficient to warrant widespread procurement and promotion of
      probiotic-containing food items in military DFACs. Health care practitioners
      considering recommending probiotics should understand that health effects and
      clinical outcomes discussed herein are specific to the probiotic strain, dose,
      and method of delivery studied in the articles cited.

PG  - 481-93

AB  - Dyspepsia is a highly prevalent condition characterized by symptoms originating
      in the gastroduodenal region without underlying organic disorder. Treatment
      modalities include acid-suppressive drugs, gastroprokinetic drugs, Helicobacter
      pylori eradication therapy, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychological
      therapies. Irritable bowel syndrome is a multifactorial, lower functional
      gastrointestinal disorder involving disturbances of the brain-gut axis. The
      pathophysiology provides the basis for pharmacotherapy: abnormal gastrointestinal
      motor functions, visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, intraluminal
      changes, and mucosal immune activation. Medications targeting chronic
      constipation or diarrhea may also relieve irritable bowel syndrome. Novel
      approaches to treatment require approval, and promising agents are guanylate
      cyclase cagonists, atypical benzodiazepines, antibiotics, immune modulators, and 
      probiotics.

LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2010.137 [doi]
AB  - IBS is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent 
      abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a
      functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical
      abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and
      judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with
      typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is
      based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective
      patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations,
      pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is
      recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and 
      impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment,
      and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms.
      Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This
      Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and
      management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well
      as reduced health-care costs.

PG  - S93-7

AB  - Clinicians have long learned of the pathogenic microorganisms that cause
      intestinal infections and that can be identified by culture methods from fecal,
      mucosa and blood samples. Nevertheless, much progress has been made due, in large
      part, to molecular biology which has enabled the discovery of pathogens that are 
      not (yet) able to be cultured, but also to the protective role of some
      microorganisms within the microbiota. Ecological and clinical disturbances
      related to antibiotic therapy were decisive for demonstrating the beneficial
      effects of the endogenous microbiota and establishing the beneficial effects of
      biotherapeutic agents, known as probiotics. Most areas of gastroenterology
      (cryptogenic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, lymphomas,
      etc.), but also those in medicine overall (obesity for example), are affected by 
      this new approach and are showing very significant progress. This article
      summarizes the historical steps of these discoveries and reviews what the
      "modern" clinician should know in this very dynamic area in regard to research
      and practical consequences.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disease during which the
      pathophysiological role of the gut microbiota has been recently highlighted. In
      almost 20% of the patients, IBS is clearly a post-infectious IBS as a consequence
      of an acute bacterial gastroenteritis. Some papers have reported an abnormal
      colonic fermentation in IBS patients that could explain symptoms such as bloating
      and be one of the factors triggering visceral hypersensitivity. More recently,
      significant differences in the composition of both the luminal and
      mucosa-associated microbiota have been reported between both IBS patients and
      healthy controls and IBS subgroups while some arguments exist for a small
      intestinal overgrowth in a subset of IBS patients. All these arguments for a
      deleterious role of the gut microbiota lead to the actual discuss to consider new
      therapeutic options, including mainly pre- and probiotics and maybe antibiotics.

      system, supply key nutrients for the major components of the gut wall, and
      modulate energy metabolism. Host-microbiome interactions can be either beneficial
      or deleterious, driving gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue activities and shaping
      gut wall structures. This overview briefly focuses on the potential role played
      by abnormalities in gut microbiota and relative responses of the gastrointestinal
      tract in the determination of important pathological conditions such as the
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. Our aim was to
      determine whether IBS-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during
      multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. 
      rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and
      Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The intervention has previously been shown to
      successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS. METHODS: The faecal
      microbiotas of 42 IBS subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind
      multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight bacterial targets within the
      gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative IBS association were measured.
      RESULTS: A phylotype with 94% similarity to Ruminococcus torques remained
      abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during
      the intervention (P = 0.02 at 6 months). In addition, the clostridial phylotype, 
      Clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention
      (P = 0.00 and P = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). The bacterial
      alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific 
      alterations in the IBS-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16S rDNA
      phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of IBS. These changes
      may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  - Durable alteration of the colonic microbiota by the administration of donor fecal
      flora.
PG  - 551-61
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181e5d06b [doi]
AB  - GOALS: To determine whether fecal bacteriotherapy results in a durable beneficial
      change in the colonic microbiota of patients with flora-related disorders.
      BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have implicated the colonic microbiota in a number of
      conditions. Administration of a fecal suspension from a healthy individual to an 
      ill individual (fecal bacteriotherapy) can cure Clostridium difficile infection
      and potentially other diseases. Oral probiotics do not work in this condition,
      yet there has been no study to determine whether fecal bacteriotherapy results in
      prolonged implantation. STUDY: Fecal samples were collected from 10 patients
      undergoing fecal bacteriotherapy. Patients completed an antibiotic schedule and
      bowel lavage before the infusion of healthy donor feces. Using a molecular
      approach, the bacterial populations in patient fecal samples were followed from
      pretreatment to 24 weeks post-initial infusion and compared with the initial
      infused donor fecal suspension. RESULTS: At intervals of 4, 8, and 24 weeks after
      the procedure, the bacterial populations in the patients' fecal samples consisted
      predominantly of bacteria derived from the healthy donor samples. Comparisons of 
      similarity at 4, 8, and 24 week samples to the donor-infused sample were made and
      each recipient's baseline sample was statistically significant with Friedman
      test. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a durable beneficial change in the
      patients' bacterial populations of the colon to represent those of the healthy
      donor's microbiota. Manipulation of the colonic microbiota to improve its
      protective and beneficial role represents a promising field of new therapeutic
      strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions.

TI  - Clinical trial on the efficacy of a new symbiotic formulation, Flortec, in
      patients with acute diarrhea: a multicenter, randomized study in primary care.
PG  - S35-41
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181e103f4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Few randomized studies have been carried out on adult patients
      affected by acute diarrhea especially in primary care, which is the natural
      context for this kind of disorder. Lactobacillus paracasei B 21060 is a novel
      strain of lactobacillus, which has been shown to be effective in relieving
      symptoms associated with diarrhea of irritable bowel syndrome subtype and in
      shortening diarrhea duration. In this study, we compared the therapeutic
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new symbiotic formulation, Flortec,
      containing L. paracasei B-21060, with lactobacillus GG (FlorVis GG) in the
      treatment of acute presumed infectious diarrhea. METHODS: Fourteen general
      practitioners working in the Perugia health authority district carried out a
      randomized controlled, parallel-group, open trial in 174 adult patients suffering
      from acute diarrhea (87 enrolled in the Flortec group and 87 in the FlorVis
      group). Both the products were administered according to their standard
      recommended dosage. The main efficacy criterion was the duration of diarrhea
      after beginning treatment. Treatment duration was 10 days. Enrolled patients kept
      a careful track of their symptoms noting them in a personal diary for 12 days.
      RESULTS: The 2 groups resulted to be homogeneous at baseline with regard to
      prognostic variables. The mean duration of diarrhea from the start of treatment
      in the Flortec group was 4.24 (2.73 SD) days versus 5.09 (3.72 SD) days in the
      FlorVis group (P=0.09).Clinical success rates in terms of absence of abdominal
      pain and absence of diarrhea (defined as <2 bowel movements of watery or loose
      stool consistency) recorded at different time-points were statistically superior 
      in the Flortec group (Kaplan-Meyer P=0.05 for both the symptoms). The physician
      judged that overall efficacy was good or very good in 91.8% of the patients in
      the Flortec group. The corresponding value in the FlorVis group was 83.7%
      (P=0.003). The 2 treatments showed a very good tolerability profile, with
      negligible and similar adverse event rates and similar concomitant medication
      usage rates. CONCLUSIONS: Oral therapy with Flortec proved to be more effective
      than FlorVis GG in the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults treated at a primary
      care setting.

PG  - 701-25
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The spreading of gastrointestinal diseases is growing all over
      the world. Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been
      found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of
      their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical
      studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic
      formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most
      significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the
      treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in
      irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on
      Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and
      altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance
      the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal
      ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and
      urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be
      particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further
      future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to
      achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in
      medical practice.

PG  - 581-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833b6471 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the evidences for the usefulness of dietary
      manipulations (including the use of probiotics and prebiotics) in the management 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusion diets do not have a
      role in the management of these patients except in the case of malabsorbed sugars
      (lactose, fructose). However, recent work suggests that excluding these sugars is
      more effective in non-IBS than in IBS patients. Also, the first small open series
      on the use of very low (20 g/day) carbohydrate diet (VLCD) in IBS has been
      published with promising results. However, safety concerns do not allow us to
      recommend them. In the period of review, further evidence has been provided on
      the role of psyllium in IBS. Also, the available evidence on the use of
      probiotics in IBS has been meta-analyzed. SUMMARY: IBS patients should eat a
      balanced diet without restrictions, and (except for malabsorbed sugars) exclusion
      diets are not useful in most of them. The role of VLCD remains to be established.
      The concept that increasing fiber intake is useful for IBS may not be true for
      all patients, and hydrophilic colloids (e.g. psyllium) are preferred. There is
      growing evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of Saccharomyces boulardii in adult patients.
PG  - 2202-22
AB  - This article reviews the evidence for efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces
      boulardii (S. boulardii) for various disease indications in adults based on the
      peer-reviewed, randomized clinical trials and pre-clinical studies from the
      published medical literature (Medline, Clinical Trial websites and meeting
      abstracts) between 1976 and 2009. For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded
      controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies,
      volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of
      efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31
      randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029
      study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe 
      in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic
      efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be
      strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea.
      Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of 
      enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori
      treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C.
      difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult
      diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related
      diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The 
      use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both
      efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.

TI  - VSL#3 improves symptoms in children with irritable bowel syndrome: a multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181ca4d95 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem
      in pediatrics, for which no safe and effective treatment is available. Probiotics
      have shown some promising results in adult studies, but no positive study has
      been published on pediatric age. We aimed at investigating the efficacy of VSL#3 
      in a population of children and teenagers affected by IBS, in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted in 7 pediatric
      gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Children 4 to 18 years of
      age, meeting eligibility criteria, were enrolled. The patients were assessed by a
      questionnaire for a 2-week baseline period. They were then randomized to receive 
      either VSL#3 or a placebo for 6 weeks, with controls every 2 weeks. At the end,
      after a "wash-out" period of 2 weeks, each patient was switched to the other
      group and followed for a further 6 weeks. RESULTS: : A total of 59 children
      completed the study. Although placebo was effective in some of the parameters and
      in as many as half of the patients, VSL#3 was significantly superior to it (P <
      0.05) in the primary endpoint, the subjective assessment of relief of symptoms;
      as well as in 3 of 4 secondary endpoints: abdominal pain/discomfort (P < 0.05),
      abdominal bloating/gassiness (P < 0.05), and family assessment of life disruption
      (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found (P = 0.06) in the stool pattern. 
      No untoward adverse effect was recorded in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: :
      VSL#3 is safe and more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms and
      improving the quality of life in children affected by IBS.

PG  - 42-66
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The goal of a comprehensive treatment in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) patients should be the improvement of symptoms and improve the quality of
      life. AIM: To review the drugs recommended in IBS, their mechanisms of action,
      side effects, risks and benefits, contraindications, availability in our country 
      and the evidence supporting their use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A technical and
      narrative review which evaluated the articles published in national and world
      literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of IBS was performed. PubMed
      and IMBIOMED electronic databases were searched (until September 2009) using all 
      descriptors regarding IBS and drug therapy. RESULTS: There is enough clinical
      evidence to recommend the use of antispasmodics (alone orin combination) and
      tricyclic antidepressants for pain treatment in IBS. Laxatives are useful in the 
      management of chronic constipation, but there is little evidence in the
      management of IBS. Although, antiflatulents and antidiarrheals are widely used
      there is little information supporting its use. The use of a nonabsorbable
      antibiotic (rifaximin) is effective in a subgroup of IBS patients.
      Serotoninergics drugs have proven effective in relieving symptoms of IBS;
      however, these drugs require caution in their use. There are studies have shown
      that probiotics improve some symptoms of IBS. CONCLUSIONS: There are many
      effective treatment options in the symptomatic management of IBS. The choice of
      treatment should be based on the predominant symptoms of each patient.

TI  - Altered intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 493-8
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that alterations in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota may play an important role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) symptoms. However, an association between the composition of the intestinal
      microbiota and IBS symptoms has not been clearly demonstrated. In the current
      issue of the Journal, Tana et al. suggest that altered intestinal microbiota
      contributes to the symptoms of IBS through increased levels of organic acids. In 
      fecal samples, IBS patients had significantly higher numbers of Veillonella and
      Lactobacillus than healthy controls. They also showed significantly higher levels
      of acetic acid and propionic acid. Furthermore, IBS patients with high acetic
      acid or propionic acid levels presented more severe symptoms, impaired quality of
      life and negative emotions. These results are in accordance with the concept that
      the gut microbiota influences the sensory, motor and immune system of the gut and
      interacts with higher brain centers. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      observed in a subset of IBS patients describes quantitative changes in the small 
      intestinal microbiota. Data on qualitative changes in the gut microbiota in IBS
      patients are lacking. Different members of gut bacteria may have different
      influence on gut function. The concepts identified here may lead to the
      development of novel therapeutic strategies for IBS using manipulation of the
      intestinal microbiota.

LID - 10.1024/1661-8157/a000095 [doi]
AB  - A multimodal approach is state-of-the art for effective treatment of functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) like irritable bowel syndrome and functional
      dyspepsia. Based on the now established view that the pathogenesis of FGD is
      multicausal, evidence-based therapeutic options comprise education about the
      nature of the disorder, dietary modifications, relaxation techniques, behavioral 
      changes, and pharmacological treatments. These therapies are variously combined
      depending on the severity of the FGD and the individual needs of the patient. Our
      overview portrays the options for the therapy of FGD and proposes that these are 
      best provided by an interdisciplinary team of primary care physicians,
      gastroenterologists, and psychosomatic medicine specialists.

PG  - 966-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gut problem that
      interferes with many people's enjoyment of life. OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) is a common gut problem that interferes with many people's
      enjoyment of life. DISCUSSION: The underlying pathophysiology of IBS is not yet
      fully understood. People's experience of IBS can fluctuate over time and various 
      bowel symptoms may predominate. Many complementary medicines are used to treat
      IBS symptoms. Currently there is good evidence to recommend the use of
      probiotics, peppermint oil capsules and psyllium. Other therapies such as Chinese
      and Ayuvedic herbs and psychological techniques look promising, but further high 
      quality trials are required before these approaches can be recommended.

TI  - Probiotic bacteria and intestinal epithelial barrier function.
PG  - G807-19
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00243.2009 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal tract is a diverse microenvironment where more than 500 species of
      bacteria thrive. A single layer of epithelium is all that separates these
      commensal microorganisms and pathogens from the underlying immune cells, and thus
      epithelial barrier function is a key component in the arsenal of defense
      mechanisms required to prevent infection and inflammation. The epithelial barrier
      consists of a dense mucous layer containing secretory IgA and antimicrobial
      peptides as well as dynamic junctional complexes that regulate permeability
      between cells. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer benefit to the host
      and that have been suggested to ameliorate or prevent diseases including
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel 
      disease. Probiotics likely function through enhancement of barrier function,
      immunomodulation, and competitive adherence to the mucus and epithelium. This
      review summarizes the evidence about effects of the many available probiotics
      with an emphasis on intestinal barrier function and the mechanisms affected by
      probiotics.

TI  - Treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics: the evidence.
PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1017/S002966511000011X [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of chronic abdominal pain, altered
      bowel habit and abdominal distension. It is the commonest cause of referral to
      gastroenterologists in the developed world and yet current therapeutic strategies
      are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in
      the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and IBS. Changes in faecal and
      mucosa-associated microbiota, post-infectious IBS, a link with small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth and an up-regulation of the GI mucosal immune system all
      suggest a role for the GI microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Given this
      evidence, therapeutic alteration of the GI microbiota by probiotic bacteria could
      be beneficial. The present paper establishes an aetiological framework for the
      use of probiotics in IBS and comprehensively reviews randomised
      placebo-controlled trials of probiotics in IBS using multiple electronic
      databases. It highlights safety concerns over the use of probiotics and attempts 
      to establish guidelines for their use in IBS in both primary and secondary care.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Treatment of functional bowel disorders of irritable bowel-type (IBS)
      in children remains a difficult task because of a lack of drugs with low adverse 
      event profile. We here report the results of a treatment study in 203 children
      (66 boys and 137 girls) age 4 to 18 years (mean: 10.5+/-4.5 years) with typical
      IBS symptoms with abdominal pain and either predominant diarrhea (n=50),
      constipation (n=56), alternating stool frequency (n=28) or unspecific pain
      (n=69). The average duration of symptoms prior to therapy was 175 days. Most
      (95%) patients up to age 11 were treated with a daily dose of 10 drops of
      Symbioflor 2 (SF2) (SymbioPharm, Herborn) (cells and autolysate of 1.5-4.5x10(7) 
      CFU of bacteria of Escherichia coli type), in the elder children 77% received
      this dosage, while the remaining received a higher dose up to 30 drops/day.
      Treatment lasted 43 days on average. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the
      treatment well and without adverse events. The key IBS symptoms (abdominal pain, 
      stool frequency) as well as the other symptoms (bloating, mucous and blood in
      stool, need for straining at stools, urge to defecate) improved significantly
      during treatment. Global assessment of therapy by parents and doctors was
      altogether positive. In summary these data confirm efficacy and tolerability of
      this probiotic compound in children and adolescents and supplement published data
      of probiotic IBS therapy in adults.

TI  - Potential benefits of probiotics--main findings of an in-depth review.
PG  - 110, 112, 114
AB  - Media reports on probiotics have been conflicting which has led to increased
      confusion among the general population and also among health professionals. To
      disentangle myths and reality, the British Nutrition Foundation has carried out a
      review on probiotics and health. There is good evidence that probiotics are
      effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and, although only few
      studies have been carried out so far, probiotic microorganisms also seem to have 
      the potential to prevent the potentially fatal Clostridium difficile-associated
      diarrhoea. A limited number of studies that are available on the effectiveness of
      probiotics on constipation have shown conflicting results, but promising results 
      have been found for certain strains. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms have been 
      found to be reduced by consuming probiotic strains, although a high placebo
      effect has been observed in some of the studies. The field of probiotics is
      relatively new and more studies will be needed to allow firm conclusions on the
      effectiveness of probiotic microorganisms for certain health issues.

TI  - Probiotics as therapy in gastroenterology: a study of physician opinions and
      recommendations.
PG  - 631-6
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181d47f5b [doi]
AB  - GOALS: The objective of this study was to determine how gastroenterologists
      perceive and use probiotic-based therapies in practice. BACKGROUND: In the United
      States, there has been a recent increase in research investigating the
      therapeutic capacities of probiotics in human disease and an accompanying
      increase in product availability and marketing. How medical care providers have
      interpreted the available literature and incorporated it into their practice has 
      not been earlier assessed. STUDY: A 16-question survey (see Survey, Supplemental 
      Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCG/A14) was distributed to practicing
      gastroenterologists and physicians with a specific interest in GI disorders
      within a large metropolitan area. RESULTS: All physicians responded that they
      believed probiotics to be safe for most patients and 98% responded that
      probiotics have a role in treating gastrointestinal illnesses or symptoms.
      Currently 93% of physicians have patients taking probiotics most often for
      irritable bowel syndrome. Commonly used probiotics included yogurt-based
      products, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (Align), and VSL#3. Most surveyed
      physicians recommended probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic, and
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because they believed that the
      literature supports their usage for these conditions. However, physician practice
      patterns did not consistently correlate with published, expert-panel-generated
      recommendations for evidence-based probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      suggests most gastrointestinal disease specialists recognize a role for and have 
      used probiotics as part of their therapeutic armamentarium; however, the
      effective implementation of this practice will benefit from additional supporting
      studies and the eventual development of clinical practice guidelines supported by
      the major gastroenterology societies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and
      contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live
      nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance,
      particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces
      boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods.
      Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including
      lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic
      organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated 
      with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest
      evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment
      of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research
      is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
      There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be
      ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically
      contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut
      colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well
      tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be
      used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised 
      or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely
      occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at
      least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing 
      and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the
      gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often 
      conflicting.

      an Asian probiotic formulation.
PG  - 93-106
LID - 10.3920/BM2008.1005 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics as dietary supplements have been readily accepted by Asian
      populations. Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number
      of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western
      scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of
      Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on
      post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these
      publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the
      clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been
      used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel
      syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and
      mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and 
      to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs
      require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The
      information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical
      information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected
      outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore,
      identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better 
      clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.

TI  - [Usefulness of probiotics in prevention and therapy].
PG  - 345-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1249168 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics exert distinct effects on the intestinal mucosa and the immune system 
      that can be used in preventive and therapeutic settings. There is evidence to
      support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and
      pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to
      ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of
      probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics
      are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel
      syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role
      in nutrient fermentation and energy metabolism and may be helpful in the
      prevention and therapy of obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some probiotics have shown efficacy for patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum MF1298 was found to have the best in
      vitro probiotic properties of 22 strains of lactobacilli. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the symptomatic effect of L. plantarum MF1298 in subjects with
      IBS. Primary outcome was treatment preference and secondary outcomes were number 
      of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and IBS sum score. METHODS: The
      design was a randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. 16
      subjects with IBS underwent two three-week periods of daily intake of one capsule
      of 10(10) CFU L. plantarum MF 1298 or placebo separated by a four-week washout
      period. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (81%; 95% CI 57% to 93%; P = 0.012)
      preferred placebo to L. plantarum MF1298 treatment. The mean (SD) number of weeks
      with satisfactory relief of symptoms in the periods with L. plantarum MF1298 and 
      placebo were 0.50 (0.89) and 1.44 (1.26), respectively (P = 0.006). IBS sum score
      was 6.44 (1.81) in the period with L. plantarum MF1298 treatment compared with
      5.35 (1.77) in the period with placebo (P = 0.010). With a clinically significant
      difference in the IBS sum score of 2 in disfavour of active treatment, the number
      needed to harm was 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.9. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows for the
      first time an unfavourable effect on symptoms in subjects with IBS after intake
      of a potential probiotic.

AB  - Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a profound impact on quality of
      life for many patients and current treatments are sometimes unsatisfactory. This 
      controlled pilot study was conducted to evaluate effects of the proprietary
      GanedenBC(30) (Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086) probiotic on IBS symptoms, in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial including patients
      with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Patients were randomized to receive either
      B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 or placebo once a day for 8 weeks. Patients filled out 
      a quality-of-life questionnaire, and self-assessment diaries were provided to
      record stool count and consistency, symptom severity, and medication consumption.
      Of the 61 patients enrolled, six did not meet the inclusion criteria and three
      were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 52 patients with IBS-D, the average
      number of bowel movements per day was significantly reduced for patients treated 
      with B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 when compared to placebo (P = 0.042). Large
      variability in baseline scores prevented the assessment of severity scores and
      quality of life. This small pilot study provides evidence that the proprietary B.
      coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic is safe and effective for reducing daily bowel
      movements in patients with IBS-D.

TI  - Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics:
      probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the functional disorder
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 690S-7S
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.113746 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically
      mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains
      have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to
      be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems
      effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome 
      is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural
      abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted
      appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show
      positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect
      is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of
      inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.

PG  - 213-8
LID - 10.1016/j.phrs.2010.01.004 [doi]
AB  - A new era in medical science has dawned with the realization of the critical role
      of the "forgotten organ", the enteric microbiota, in generating a variety of
      functions which sustain health and, when disrupted, lead to disease. Central to
      this beneficial interaction between the microbiota and man is the manner in which
      the bacteria contained within the gut "talk" to the immune system and, in
      particular, the immune system that is so widespread within the gut itself, the
      gut-associated (or mucosa-associated) lymphoid system. Into this landscape come
      two new players: probiotics and prebiotics. While many products have masqueraded 
      as probiotics, only those which truly and reproducibly contain live organisms and
      which have been shown, in high quality human studies, to confer a health benefit 
      can actually claim this title. Several human disease states have benefited from
      the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel
      diseases, certain infectious disorders and, most recently, irritable bowel
      syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria and, while a variety
      of health benefits have been attributed to their use, prebiotics have been
      subjected to few large scale clinical trials.

AB  - Recently, there has been strong interest in the therapeutic potential of
      probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). At the same time, there is a
      rapidly growing body of evidence to support an etiological role for
      gastrointestinal infection and the associated immune activation in the
      development of post-infectious IBS. In a more controversial area, small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been associated with a subset of patients
      with IBS; the issue of whether it is appropriate to treat a subset of IBS
      patients with antibiotics and probiotics is currently a matter for debate. Thus, 
      it appears that the gastrointestinal microbial flora may exert beneficial effects
      for symptoms of IBS under some circumstances, while in other situations gut
      microbes could give rise to symptoms of IBS. How do we make sense of the
      apparently diverse roles that 'bugs' may play in IBS? To address this question,
      we have conducted an in-depth review, attempting where possible to draw lessons
      from Asian studies.

PG  - 837-42
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0837 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy still surrounds the question whether yeasts found in the 
      gut are causally related to disease, constitute a health hazard, or require
      treatment. METHODS: The authors present the state of knowledge in this area on
      the basis of a selective review of articles retrieved by a PubMed search from
      2005 onward. The therapeutic recommendations follow the current national and
      international guidelines. RESULTS: Yeasts, mainly Candida species, are present in
      the gut of about 70% of healthy adults. Mucocutaneous Candida infections are due 
      either to impaired host defenses or to altered gene expression in formerly
      commensal strains. The expression of virulence factors enables yeasts to form
      biofilms, destroy tissues, and escape the immunological attacks of the host.
      Yeast infections of the intestinal mucosa are of uncertain clinical significance,
      and their possible connection to irritable bowel syndrome, while plausible,
      remains unproved. Yeast colonization can trigger allergic reactions. Mucosal
      yeast infections are treated with topically active polyene antimycotic drugs. The
      adjuvant administration of probiotics is justified on the basis of positive
      results from controlled clinical trials. CONCLUSION: The eradication of
      intestinal yeasts is advised only for certain clearly defined indications.

AB  - Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) commonly report the
      precipitation of symptoms on food ingestion. Though the role of dietary
      constituents in IBS has not been extensively studied, food could contribute to
      symptom onset or even the causation of IBS through a number of mechanisms. First,
      the physiological response of the intestine to food ingestion could precipitate
      symptoms in predisposed individuals; second, there is some evidence that allergy 
      or intolerance to a particular food can produce IBS-like symptoms, third, certain
      foods may alter the composition of the luminal milieu, either directly or
      indirectly through effects on bacterial metabolism, and thus induce symptoms and,
      finally, IBS may develop following exposure to food-borne pathogens.
      Anticipatory, psychological factors generated by previous negative experiences
      with food ingestion or other factors may also contribute though their
      contribution has been scarcely quantified. Not surprisingly, there is
      considerable interest in the potential roles of diet and food supplements in the 
      therapy of IBS; for the most part, the evidence base for such recommendations
      remains slim though certain probiotics show considerable promise.

PG  - S68-78

AB  - In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief 
      of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents,
      or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of
      dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary
      fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, 
      osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while
      loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of
      stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve
      symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower
      doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for 
      pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance
      to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin,
      metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical
      trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or
      lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic
      approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in 
      combination with pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Bacterial infections: new and emerging enteric pathogens.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e328333d73b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to highlight recent advances in
      knowledge of bacterial enteric infections. We focus on understanding of
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni infections,
      and to link these acute events with long-term consequences in a susceptible host,
      including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli and C. jejuni are zoonotic infections 
      that are acquired from exposure to tainted food (undercooked hamburger and
      chicken, respectively) and contaminated drinking water. Noninvasive E. coli
      O157:H7 elaborates Shiga-like toxins and protein effectors that are injected, via
      a molecular syringe that is encoded by a bacterial type 3 secretion system, into 
      infected eukaryotic cells. Less is known about the precise virulence properties
      of enteroinvasive Campylobacter strains, but both enteric pathogens are able to
      disrupt polarized epithelial monolayers resulting in increased uptake of
      macromolecules and antigens. SUMMARY: An improved understanding of the
      epidemiology, pathobiology and mechanisms underlying infectious enterocolitides
      will provide the basis for developing new intervention strategies including, for 
      example, the use of probiotics, to interrupt the infectious process.

TI  - Understanding the role of probiotics in supporting digestive comfort.
PG  - 47-55; quiz 56
AB  - Many people experience digestive discomfort at some time in their lives. It
      affects those who are healthy and unhealthy, and in some cases can signal a more 
      serious underlying condition. For most people the discomfort is minor and
      transitory, but for some it can cause regular unpleasant symptoms, such as
      bloating. More severe gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) can have a significant impact on health and wellbeing. There are
      relatively few options for people with digestive discomfort and/or IBS. In recent
      years the body of evidence to support the health benefits of consuming probiotics
      has grown significantly. This article investigates how certain strains of
      probiotics have been shown to reduce digestive discomfort and symptoms of IBS. It
      highlights some of the problems associated with poor digestive health and offers 
      guidance on educating patients about digestive comfort.

      renin, and phytoestrogens.
PG  - 3755-75
LID - 10.3390/ijms10093755 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are live organisms that are primarily used to improve gastrointestinal
      disorders such as diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, lactose
      intolerance, and to inhibit the excessive proliferation of pathogenic intestinal 
      bacteria. However, recent studies have suggested that probiotics could have
      beneficial effects beyond gastrointestinal health, as they were found to improve 
      certain metabolic disorders such as hypertension. Hypertension is caused by
      various factors and the predominant causes include an increase in cholesterol
      levels, incidence of diabetes, inconsistent modulation of renin and imbalanced
      sexual hormones. This review discusses the antihypertensive roles of probiotics
      via the improvement and/or treatment of lipid profiles, modulation of insulin
      resistance and sensitivity, the modulation of renin levels and also the
      conversion of bioactive phytoestrogens as an alternative replacement of sexual
      hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.

LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04183.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of probiotic bacteria in IBS remain controversial. AIM:
      To study the effects of a probiotic product on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We
      randomized 74 IBS patients to receive 8 weeks of daily treatment with 400 mL milk
      fermented with the yoghurt bacteria and containing Lactobacillus paracasei, ssp. 
      paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12
      (Cultura; active) or acidified milk without these bacteria (control). The primary
      endpoint was the proportion of subjects reporting adequate relief of their IBS
      symptoms at least 50% of the weeks. IBS symptom severity, psychological symptoms 
      and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was 38% 
      (14/37 patients) in the active group and 27% (10/37 patients) in the control
      group (P = 0.3). IBS symptom severity improved significantly in both groups
      during the treatment period. This change was greater in the active group during
      the first 2 weeks, but thereafter, no significant group differences were seen.
      CONCLUSIONS: We could not detect a clearly positive effect of fermented milk
      containing three probiotic bacteria on GI symptoms in IBS patients compared with 
      the control treatment. However, a trend towards a more favourable effect during
      the first weeks was seen in the active group.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract, characterised by abdominal pain and change in bowel habit, with a
      fluctuating natural history. The exact etiology remains unknown, but it is
      unlikely there is a single unifying explanation. The prevalence in the general
      population is between 5% and 20%, and the condition represents a considerable
      financial burden to the health service. Guidelines for the management of IBS
      recommend that symptom-based diagnostic criteria should be used to make a
      positive diagnosis, without the need for recourse to investigations to exclude
      organic disease. However, current evidence demonstrates that these have either
      not been well-validated in prospective studies or perform suboptimally.
      Investigations to exclude underlying organic disease in IBS have a low yield, and
      the diagnosis is unlikely to be revised during extended follow-up, although
      screening for celiac disease with serology appeared to be of value in a recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis, Despite the fact that no therapy is
      established to alter the natural history of IBS, a series of systematic reviews
      and meta-analyses, conducted to inform the American College of Gastroenterology's
      updated monograph on IBS, have demonstrated that fibre, antispasmodics,
      antidepressants, psychological therapies, 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT4 agonists, and 
      probiotics are all more effective than placebo. Anti-diarrheal agents may be of
      some benefit, in terms of improved stool frequency and consistency in
      diarrhea-predominant IBS, and lubiprostone may have a role in
      constipation-predominant IBS, though data for this drug are preliminary at
      present.

      aspects.
PG  - 237-72
AB  - Starting from Metchnikoff's theory of cell-mediated immunity and work on
      lactobacillus over 100 years ago, more and more applications for probiotics have 
      been developed. Research into the health properties of probiotics has focused
      primarily on two areas: the interaction between intestinal microflora and
      enterocytes and the immune system and the use of probiotic products in the
      treatment of gastrointestinal diseases in adults and children. This review
      examines recent studies on the clinical use of monostrain and multistrain
      probiotic products in gastroenterology. The most widely studied strains are
      lactobacilli and yeasts, specifically, Lacto-bacillus rhamnosus GG and
      Saccharomices boulardii; the gastrointestinal disorders most commonly treated
      with probiotics are inflammatory bowel disease and dysbiosis, both of which
      clinically manifest as diarrhea.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia may lead to
      therapy-resistant, long-lasting post-giardiasis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      We report two open pilot studies aiming to treat this condition, using either
      antibiotics or bacterio-therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty-eight patients with
      persistent abdominal symptoms, following clearance of G. lamblia infection, were 
      investigated. Eighteen received treatment with rifaximin plus metronidazole (8-10
      days) whereas 10 received a suspension of live faecal flora, installed into the
      duodenum during gastro-duodenoscopy. Customary abdominal symptoms and symptoms
      following a lactulose breath test were quantified by questionnaires. Hydrogen and
      methane production after lactulose were analysed in expired air and excretion of 
      fat and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was examined in faeces. RESULTS. As
      compared with pre-treatment values, total customary symptom scores were barely
      significantly reduced (p = 0.07) after antibiotics, but were highly significantly
      reduced (p = 0.0009) after bacterio-therapy. However, symptom improvement
      following bacterio-therapy did not persist 1 year later. Hydrogen breath
      excretion was slightly reduced after antibiotics, but not after bacterio-therapy.
      Compared with healthy persons, faecal excretion of fat was significantly
      increased in Giardia-cured patients. SCFAs were increased in the bacterio-therapy
      group, and were not influenced by therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Both antibiotics and
      bacterio-therapy were ineffective with respect to cure of post-giardiasis IBS.
      High faecal excretion of fat and SCFAs suggests that intestinal malabsorption of 
      fat and carbohydrates may play a role in the IBS-like complaints of these
      patients.

TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics. An etiopathogenic approach
      at last?
PG  - 553-64
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional digestive disorder, 
      and may affect 11-20% of the adult population in industrialized countries. In
      accordance with Rome III criteria (2006) IBS involves abdominal pain and bowel
      habit disturbance, which are not explained by structural or biochemical
      abnormalities. Several hypotheses attempt to account for the pathophysiology of
      IBS, but the etiology still remains uncertain or obscure, perhaps multifactorial.
      Abnormalities in colonic microflora have recently been suggested in such
      patients, as has abnormal small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), or in
      particular a significant reduction in the amount of intraluminal Bifidobacteria
      or Lactobacilli, with consequences like the production of colonic gas, and
      motility or sensitivity disturbances of the intestinal tract. The disorder is
      difficult to treat, and the wide spectrum of non-drug and drug treatments shows
      our ignorance about the cause of the condition. Newer drugs, both pro- and
      anti-serotonin, have failed to show long-term efficacy or have been withdrawn due
      to concerns about harmful effects. Recent research has provided increasing
      support for the idea that disturbances of intestinal microbiota occur in patients
      with IBS, and that such abnormalities may contribute to IBS symptoms. Studies in 
      Scandinavian countries in the last ten years emphasize the role of probiotics in 
      the modulation of intestinal microbiota, and as a consequence in the regulation
      of the motility and hypersensitivity of the digestive tract. Although results
      between studies are difficult to compare because of differences in study design, 
      probiotic dose, strain, and duration of therapy, some studies show symptom
      improvement. Lactobacilli are found among the normal bacterial flora of the
      gastrointestinal tract, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) is one of the species
      frequently isolated from the human mucosa, which is capable of surviving the low 
      pH of the stomach and duodenum, resisting the effect of bile acids in the upper
      small intestine when ingested, and temporarily colonizing the gastrointestinal
      tract by binding to the intestinal and colonic mucosa. Concurrent with
      colonization by Lp there is a decrease in bacterial groups with gas-producing
      ability, such as Veillonella spp. and Clostridia spp. Evidence has now
      accumulated to suggest the efficacy of certain probiotics like Lp299v, which may 
      be capable of bringing about a significant reduction in pain, abdominal
      distension and flatulence, while increasing health-related quality of life in
      IBS.

PG  - 400-5
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most important cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea. The emergence of a hypervirulent strain and other factors including
      antibiotic overuse contribute to the increasing incidence and severity of this
      potentially lethal infection. CDI has been reported in persons previously
      considered as low risk, such as young healthy persons without exposure to health 
      care settings or antibiotics, peripartum women, and children. In patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, the risk of C. difficile infection is even greater,
      with higher rates of hospitalization, bowel surgery, and mortality. With
      increasing incidence and severity of disease, the need for improved diagnostic,
      treatment, and infection control strategies cannot be overstated.

TI  - Probiotic-induced changes in the intestinal epithelium: implications in
      gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - There is resurgent interest in the use of probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal
      and systemic health, driven by recent advances in knowledge of bacterial
      interactions with the epithelium and innate immune system of the intestine. The
      effects of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal epithelium and their downstream
      consequences are reviewed. Probiotics prevent pathogen adherence and invasion of 
      the epithelium, partly by blocking adherence sites but also by upregulating gene 
      expression of MUC2 and of antimicrobial peptides. Metabolic effects of probiotics
      on the intestinal epithelium include production of short chain fatty acids which 
      influence epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis. Bacterial
      metabolism of unabsorbed dietary constituents with production of free radicals
      and phenolic metabolites can lead to DNA damage and cancer; probiotics restore
      eubiosis and potentially prevent this. Probiotics alter expression and
      redistribution of tight junction proteins and reduce intestinal permeability
      limiting absorption of noxious molecules from the gut lumen. Most studied are the
      effects of probiotics on epithelial cells which are the first line of innate
      immune-capable cells that encounter luminal flora. Probiotics, through secreted
      molecules, influence the innate inflammatory response of epithelial cells to
      stimuli from the gut lumen, and reduce mucosal inflammation. Through effects on
      dendritic, and possibly epithelial, cells they influence naive T cells in the
      lamina propria of the gut and thus influence adaptive immunity. These varied
      effects of probiotics have implications for the treatment of several
      gastrointestinal diseases including antibiotic-associated colitis, acute
      gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

AB  - Gastrointestinal infection is ubiquitous worldwide though the pattern of
      infection varies widely. Poor hygiene and lack of piped water is associated with 
      a high incidence of childhood infection, both viral and bacterial. However in
      developed countries bacterial infection is commoner in young adults. Studies of
      bacterial infections in developed countries suggest 75% of adults fully recover, 
      however around 25% have long lasting changes in bowel habit and a smaller number 
      develop the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Whether the incidence is similar in
      developing countries is unknown. Post-infective IBS (PI-IBS) shares many features
      with unselected IBS but by having a defined onset allows better definition of
      risk factors. These are in order of importance: severity of initial illness,
      smoking, female gender and adverse psychological factors. Symptoms may last many 
      years for reasons which are unclear. They are likely to include genetic factors
      controlling the immune response, alterations in serotonin signaling, low grade
      mucosal inflammation maintained by psychological stressors and alterations in gut
      microbiota. As yet there are no proven specific treatments, though 5HT(3)
      receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatory agents and probiotics are all logical
      treatments which should be examined in large well-designed randomised placebo
      controlled trials.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting up
      to 3-15% of the general population in western countries. It is characterised by
      unexplained abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating in association with altered 
      bowel habits. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial
      involving disturbances of the brain-gut axis. The pathophysiology provides the
      rationale for pharmacotherapy: abnormal gastrointestinal motor functions,
      visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, autonomic dysfunction, and
      mucosal immune activation. Understanding the mechanisms, and their mediators or
      modulators including neurotransmitters and receptors have led to several
      therapeutic approaches including agents acting on the serotonin receptor or
      serotonin transporter system, antidepressants, novel selective anticholinergics, 
      alpha-adrenergic agonists, opioid agents, cholecystokinin-antagonists,
      neurokinin-antagonists, somatostatin receptor agonists, corticotropin releasing
      factor antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase-c agonists,
      melatonin, atypical benzodiazepines, antibiotics, immune modulators and
      probiotics. The mechanisms and current evidence regarding efficacy of these
      agents are reviewed.

TI  - [Efficacy of using inulin fortified fermented milk products in patients with
      functional constipation].
PG  - 56-61
AB  - The research involved 76 patients with irritable bowel syndrome with
      constipation. Introduction of fermented milk products--inulin fortified spoon
      yoghurt, drinking, yoghurt, kefir drink--into a standard ration exerted influence
      upon dynamics of basis manifestations of illness and made for increase of
      indices, which characterize patients' quality of life. The biggest was marked
      upon use of spoon yoghurt and kefir drink. After use of drinking yoghurt,
      dyspeptic effects were observed in a third part of patients.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a mild disorder; purely symptomatic treatment.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - (1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders,
      associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an
      underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious
      disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, 
      unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also
      present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course 
      of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on
      abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials.
      Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and
      only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do
      not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to 
      have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse
      effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor
      has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
      (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of
      potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative
      risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well
      as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic 
      laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation 
      can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly
      assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It
      modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; 
      (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients
      are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel
      syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9)
      Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances
      have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and
      psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral
      products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of
      intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with
      inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six
      available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a
      placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel
      syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment
      should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful
      physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available 
      treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best 
      to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry
      a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.

TI  - The role of diet in symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in adults: a narrative
      review.
PG  - 1204-14
LID - 10.1016/j.jada.2009.04.012 [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes what is known about the effect of diet on irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms emphasizing data from randomized, controlled clinical
      trials. Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be
      caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate 
      that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including
      fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar
      alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long
      history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may 
      worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will
      improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been
      adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS
      symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture 
      yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, 
      it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an
      adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the
      most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified
      exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating
      classes of food may be useful.

TI  - Prophylactic role of maternal administration of probiotics in the prevention of
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 764-7
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.04.023 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal stress is a common early life event which alters the development of the 
      endocrine and immune systems. Specifically, exposure to neonatal stress results
      in alterations to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in
      offspring who hyper-respond to stress in adulthood. Recently, this concept has
      been applied to the ontogeny of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances
      such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The high prevalence of this disorder and 
      the ineffectiveness of current treatments results in high direct and indirect
      costs to the society. Recently, administration of probiotics to neonates has been
      used as a safe and cost-effective preventative strategy to revoke the long term
      unfavourable imprinting induced on the gastrointestinal system by early life
      stressors in animal models of human IBS. It is not as yet known however, whether 
      maternal supplementary probiotics may also contribute to improved GI integrity
      and gut-associated immune functioning in stressed neonates, if these possible
      improvements persist into adulthood, or how this protective effect may be
      mediated. Our hypothesis is an attempt to link this proposed nutritional approach
      and its possible preventive effects against GI dysfunctions provoked by neonatal 
      stress.

TI  - Targeting the human microbiome with antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics:
      gastroenterology enters the metagenomics era.
PG  - 2015-31
AB  - Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our
      knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our
      understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is
      refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of
      human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions.
      Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity,
      relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of
      nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the
      composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of
      gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the
      gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics,
      probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress
      undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing 
      microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host.
      Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to
      maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these
      approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific
      disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies
      to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
      colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.

PG  - 40-7
AB  - Probiotics are defined viable microorganisms which in sufficient amount reach the
      intestine in an active state, to be able to exert positive health benefit on the 
      host. Thus far, they have shown particular promise on prevention or treatment of 
      various pathologic conditions. Our aim has been to report the most recent
      articles (until October 2008), resulting from randomized, double controlled
      trials, according to the conventional and molecular methods. In this review we
      have taken into consideration almost all the fields in which the probiotics have 
      been given, either with a prophylactic or therapeutic intent. So far we have
      summarized the actual results concerning lactose intolerance, acute rotavirus
      diarrhea, traveller's diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, Clostridium
      difficile infection, and the role as adjuvant in Helicobacter pylori eradication.
      Furthermore, we have synthesised articles concerning the probiotic connection in 
      irritable bowel syndrome, and in inflammatory bowel diseases. Last but not least,
      the prevention by probiotics of allergic diseases, of bacterial vaginosis, of
      respiratory infections, and the possible advantage in hypercholesteremic
      subjects.

      from studies conducted in humans.
PG  - 1428-518
AB  - A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various
      probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters,
      infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of
      the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and
      mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by 
      some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation,
      the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear 
      less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of
      diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition.
      Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults,
      but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious
      outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are
      less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic
      supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk
      and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early
      supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from
      studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans
      is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects
      seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of
      probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the
      subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements 
      were made.

      study.
PG  - 569-70
LID - 10.1177/0148607109332004 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in
      response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral
      chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining.
      Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have
      gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief
      communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer
      patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a
      multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated
      with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies
      combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and
      Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study
      demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different
      probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of
      study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that
      probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.

AB  - Probiotics are preparations containing viable microorganisms that confer
      potential health benefits for the host. Alteration of bacterial flora both in
      terms of specific content and concentration may be beneficial in many
      gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are widely used for the management of
      these conditions in many countries. However, mechanisms of probiotics are
      incompletely understood. Benefits observed clinically with one species or
      combinations of species can not be generalized. The optimal dose of treatment has
      to be determined. Although probiotics are generally regarded safe, caution is
      needed when using these supplements routinely. It has been proved, that severe
      adverse events can occur as a complication of probiotic treatment. This review
      summarizes the recent knowledge concerning the use of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  - Bifidobacterium infantis 35624: a novel probiotic for the treatment of irritable 
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 7-15
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder with widespread prevalence.
      Due to its heterogeneous pathogenesis, efficacious treatments are lacking. The
      few medications that are effective for treating global IBS symptoms have either
      been withdrawn or restricted due to detrimental side effects; thus, safe and
      effective alternatives are urgently needed. Increasing data have revealed that
      inflammatory changes may play a role in the development of IBS, and probiotics,
      commensal organisms with inherent health benefits, may alter that milieu.
      Although their exact mechanisms of action remain elusive, it is clear that the
      beneficial properties inherent to each probiotic species are strain specific.
      Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 ( B infantis 35624; Bifantis, The Procter & Gamble
      Company, Cincinnati, OH), is a probiotic with unique abilities to reduce
      intestinal inflammation. Two randomized, controlled trials have validated its
      efficacy for treating both individual and global IBS symptoms without evidence to
      suggest an increase in adverse events. B. infantis 35624 appears safe and
      effective for the treatment of IBS.

PG  - 39-45
AB  - AIM: To characterize pathogenesis, clinicolaboratory criteria and treatment of
      postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PICS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
      examination including histological study of the small and large intestine mucosa,
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), coagglutination reaction using shigella,
      salmonella, yersinia, campilobacter jejuni diagnosticums, indirect
      hemagglutination reaction for identification of antibodies to these agents in the
      blood serum was conducted in 750 patients with PICS. Fecal seeding on selective
      media was made as well as the respiratory test for bacterial growth in the small 
      intestine. Immune status was studied with laser cytometry, chemiluminescence,
      immunodiffusion, immunofluorescence, flow laser cytofluorometry. Personality
      profile was assessed by MMPI. RESULTS: PICS was diagnosed in 599 (79.9%) of 750
      patients. Most of them had diarrhea, abnormal fecal microflora, antigens of acute
      intestinal infection agents in circulating immune complexes of the serum and
      coprofiltrates. Immune system was characterized by low phagocytic activity,
      attenuation of cell and humoral immunity. Etiotropic and pathogenetic treatment
      including intestinal antiseptics, probiotics and immunomodulators produced
      persistent remission during a year in 79.3% PICS patients. CONCLUSION: PICS is
      described which differs from ICS by registration of markers of acute intestinal
      infections in biological media, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and
      dysbiosis in the large intestine, immunodeficiency. A positive response was
      observed to treatment with intestinal antiseptic and enterosorbent drugs,
      probiotics and immunomodulators.

TI  - Bacillus coagulans significantly improved abdominal pain and bloating in patients
      with IBS.
PG  - 119-24
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2009.03.1984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can have a profound impact
      on emotional health and quality of life, and current treatments are sometimes
      unsatisfactory for patients facing this lifelong disease. Probiotics, which can
      normalize gastrointestinal microflora, may alleviate symptoms of IBS. OBJECTIVE: 
      This preliminary controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the
      probiotic Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 on IBS symptoms. METHODS: This was a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      involving 44 subjects who received either placebo or B coagulans GBI-30, 6086
      once a day for 8 weeks. Self-assessments of the severity of IBS symptoms
      (abdominal pain and bloating) were recorded every day for 8 weeks. Because
      baseline values were significantly different between the 2 study groups,
      within-group analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Improvements from baseline
      abdominal pain and bloating scores in the B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 group were
      statistically significant for all 7 weekly comparisons (P < 0.01). In the placebo
      group, only changes in abdominal pain scores at weeks 6 and 8 achieved
      statistical significance (P < 0.05). No treatment-related adverse events or
      serious adverse events were reported during the 8-week study period. CONCLUSIONS:
      Preliminary data suggest that the patented B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic may
      be a safe and effective option for the relief of abdominal pain and bloating for 
      patients with IBS. Larger, extended trials are needed to verify these results.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, not sustained by structural changes. 
      There is now consistent evidence indicating that IBS may be the adverse outcome
      of an acute episode of infectious gastroenteritis, the so-called postinfectious
      (PI) IBS. The infectious agents involved in the development of PI-IBS include
      pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are the 
      most common symptoms of PI-IBS. Several studies identified a number of risk
      factors increasing the susceptibility for PI-IBS development. These include the
      virulence of the pathogen, the severity, and duration of the acute enteritis,
      younger age, female sex, and psychological disturbances. Several mucosal
      abnormalities in the colon or ileum of patients who develop PI-IBS have been
      described. These changes include increased mucosal permeability, an increased
      amount of intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria T cells, and mast cells, as
      well as serotonin-containing enteroendocrine cells. The mediators released by
      these activated cells may evoke enteric nervous system responses, excite sensory 
      afferent pathways, and induce visceral hyperalgesia. Little is known about the
      prognosis of PI-IBS, although it is likely better than that of nonspecific IBS.
      There is little evidence about a specific treatment for PI-IBS. Although
      probiotics and antibiotics may be promising in the prevention of PI-IBS, the
      efficacy of these treatments should be assessed in an ad hoc designed study.

AB  - Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.
      Although there is evidence that gastrointestinal flora is important in gut
      motility, there is little evidence that gut flora is abnormal in constipation.
      Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increase stool frequency and decrease consistency
      in normal individuals. But, according to several reviews, the evidence of
      probiotics for efficacy in constipation is limited. Fiber supplements,
      lactose-free diets, and lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the
      management of children with recurrent abdominal pain and irritable bowel
      syndrome. Several studies with Lactobacillus GG in children showed negative
      results in children with chronic constipation. Because Bifidobacterium animalis
      DN-173 010 has been shown to be effective in adults with constipation-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome this study should also be performed in a well-designed
      large placebo-controlled trial in children with constipation.

AB  - Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), frequently associated with psychological
      distress, is characterized by hypersensitivity to gut wall distension. Some
      probiotics are able to alleviate IBS symptoms and reduce visceromotor response to
      mechanical stimuli in animals. Moreover, we have previously shown that
      Lactobacillus farciminis treatment abolished the hyperalgesia to colorectal
      distension (CRD) induced by acute stress. The aims of the present study were to
      determine whether (i) stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia modifies the
      expression of Fos, a marker of general neuronal activation, induced by CRD, (ii) 
      this activation can be modulated by L. farciminis treatment. Female rats were
      treated by L. farciminis and CRD was performed after partial restraint stress
      (PRS) or sham-PRS. The expression of Fos protein was measured by
      immunohistochemistry. After CRD or PRS, Fos expression was increased in spinal
      cord section (S1), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), paraventricular nucleus
      (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA). The
      combination of both stimuli, PRS and CRD, markedly increased this Fos
      overexpression in the sacral spinal cord section, PVN and MeA, but not in NTS. By
      contrast, a pretreatment with L. farciminis significantly reduced the number of
      Fos positive cells in these area. This study shows that PRS enhances Fos protein 
      expression induced by CRD at the spinal and supraspinal levels in rats.
      Lactobacillus farciminis treatment inhibited this enhancing effect, suggesting
      that the antinociceptive effect of this probiotic strain results from a decrease 
      of the stress-induced activation/sensitization of sensory neurons at the spinal
      and supraspinal level.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder and available
      therapies have limited efficacy. Mucosal inflammation and alterations in gut
      microflora may contribute to the development of IBS symptoms, and researchers
      have hypothesized that probiotics might improve these symptoms. The aim of this
      study was to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of probiotics in the treatment 
      of IBS. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches of multiple databases were
      performed. Study selection criteria were as follows: (i) RCTs, (ii) adults with
      IBS defined by Manning or Rome II criteria, (iii) single or combination probiotic
      vs. placebo, and (iv) improvement in IBS symptoms and/or decrease in frequency of
      adverse events reported. Data about study design and results were extracted in
      duplicate using standardized data extraction forms. Owing to variability in
      outcome measures, quantitative pooling of data was not feasible. RESULTS: A total
      of 16 RCTs met selection criteria. Of those, 11 studies showed suboptimal study
      design with inadequate blinding, inadequate trial length, inadequate sample size,
      and/or lack of intention-to-treat analysis. None of the studies provided
      quantifiable data about both tolerability and adverse events. Bifidobacterium
      infantis 35624 showed significant improvement in the composite score for
      abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and/or bowel movement difficulty 
      compared with placebo (P<0.05) in two appropriately designed studies. No other
      probiotic showed significant improvement in IBS symptoms in an appropriately
      designed study. CONCLUSIONS: B. infantis 35624 has shown efficacy for improvement
      of IBS symptoms. Most RCTs about the utility of probiotics in IBS have not used
      an appropriate study design and do not adequately report adverse events.
      Therefore, there is inadequate data to comment on the efficacy of other
      probiotics. Future probiotic studies should follow Rome II recommendations for
      appropriate design of an RCT.

AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms that produce a benefit to the host when
      provided in adequate amounts from food or supplements. There is an increased
      interest in the use of probiotics in the management and treatment of complex
      medical conditions. Recommendations for probiotic supplementation in the
      pediatric population are often conflicting due to limited research in many
      pediatric disease states. Research on single and multistrain probiotics has shown
      promise for some pediatric populations. This review discusses the research
      available for probiotic supplementation for children with irritable bowel
      syndrome, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency
      virus, and food allergies. Probiotic safety also is discussed.

AB  - Diverticular disease is one of the most common medical conditions affecting
      Western populations. Inflammatory complications are the most common manifestation
      of the disease and typically cause acute bouts of abdominal pain and fever.
      Chronic symptoms can also occur and can be mistakenly attributed to irritable
      bowel syndrome and rarely to inflammatory bowel disease. Alterations in
      peridiverticular bacterial flora are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis
      of diverticular inflammation. This article discusses the rationale and reviews
      the existing clinical data regarding the role of probiotics in the management of 
      diverticular disease.

AB  - Among the numerous positive effects of probiotic microorganisms and prebiotic
      carbohydrates observed in clinical studies--the majority of which, however, does 
      not fulfil the criteria of pharmaceutical verification--some are of specific
      relevance to female health. The present review addresses--besides some notes
      concerning the potential microbiota-hormone interactions--the first line with
      preventive and/or therapeutic applications of probiotic bacteria in order to
      maintain a balanced intestinal and urogenital flora, as well as in the case of
      irritable bowel syndrome, constipation (idiopathic slow-transit) and urogenital
      tract infections. Further aspects are the promotion of bone health and
      osteoporosis prevention brought about by inulin, oligofructose and
      galactooligosaccharides. Some further conditions, namely anorexia nervosa, the
      premenstrual syndrome as well as prevention or alleviation of climacteric and
      menopausal disorders, for which the use of probiotics is rather hypothetical or
      is largely studied by alternative medicine practising physicians, are addressed
      briefly.

      containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 and yoghourt strains
      (test product) on digestive comfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed
      gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: The study was designed to approximate a
      real-life situation, by using a branded product in the intervention groups. In an
      open-label, randomized, controlled trial, 371 adults reporting digestive
      discomfort were randomized into three groups who had a daily consumption of
      either one or two pots of test product over 2 weeks, or to follow their usual
      diet. Digestive comfort and bother from digestive symptoms were assessed by
      questionnaire at baseline and follow-up (per protocol population n = 360).
      Self-reported change in digestive comfort and computed change between baseline
      and follow-up for each of 20 items were compared between groups
      (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). RESULTS: A higher percentage of participants
      consuming the test product reported improved digestive comfort (1-pot group
      82.5%; 2-pot group 84.3%), than controls (2.9%). Their self-reported change
      scores differed significantly (P < 0.001). For both test product groups, almost
      all symptom scores improved significantly more than controls (P < 0.001). There
      were no significant differences between 1-pot and 2-pot groups. CONCLUSIONS: This
      pilot study shows that daily consumption of a probiotic food in real-life
      conditions may be useful in improving digestive comfort and symptom experience of
      adults from general population. Further double-blind randomized controlled
      studies are required to confirm these health benefits.

AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are highly prevalent in Western
      countries yet no single mechanism or etiological agent that initiates IBS has
      been identified. Current research has implicated the intestinal microbiota with
      FGIDs. This article reviews the available literature/data regarding the
      intestinal microbiota and FGIDS. The possible relationships between the
      intestinal microbiota and the intestinal function and functional bowel symptoms
      are discussed.

AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a low grade immune
      activation. However, little is known about the properties of B cells of IBS
      patients. We therefore investigated activation level and antigen presenting
      phenotype of blood B cells of IBS patients. We also examined B-cell responses to 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and probiotic bacteria. Blood samples were obtained from
      74 IBS patients and 30 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 
      isolated and stimulated with LPS or an UV-light inactivated bacterial cocktail
      consisting of the probiotic Gram-positive strains; Lactobacillus paracasei ssp.
      paracasei 19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis B612. The
      phenotype of CD19(+) B cells was investigated by flow cytometry before and after 
      72 h cell culture. Furthermore, IBS symptom severity was assessed. B cells
      isolated from blood of IBS patients displayed an amplified activation level as
      demonstrated by increased cell surface expression of IgG, and also the
      costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. Expression of antigen presenting HLA-DR
      and costimulatory molecule CD40 on B cells was, however comparable in IBS
      patients and controls. B cells of IBS patients displayed an impaired ability to
      increase expression of CD80, but not CD86, in response to both LPS as well as
      probiotic bacteria stimulations. To conclude, blood B cells of IBS patients have 
      an increased activation level. Bacterial component induced expression of the
      costimulatory molecule CD80, regarded as important for tolerance induction, is
      impaired. These data suggest that B-cell antigen presentation in IBS patients is 
      associated with altered capacity of providing costimulation to T cells.

TI  - Complementary and alternative medicine for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence supporting selected complementary and
      alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January
      1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 
      2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with
      complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint
      oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic,
      hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were
      screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. 
      Level I evidence was available for most interventions. MAIN MESSAGE: Soluble
      fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates
      IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for
      IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain.
      Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic
      options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by
      limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are
      supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: Several
      complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an
      evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients
      with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal
      disorder and the evidence for efficacy of most drug therapies in the treatment of
      IBS is weak. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several
      conditions. including IBS. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements.The aim
      of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials study was to
      evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating symptoms in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. We searched Ovid versions of MEDLINE (1950-2007),
      EMBASE (1980-2007), CINAHL (1982-2007), AMED (1985-2007), the Cochrane library
      and hand searched retrieved papers. RESULTS: We identified 14 randomized placebo 
      controlled trials. Combined data suggested a modest improvement in overall
      symptoms after several weeks of treatment: for dichotomous data from seven trials
      the overall Odds Ratio (OR) was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2); for continuous data
      from six trials the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07 to 
      0.38).For individual symptoms the results differed between the pooled dichotomous
      and pooled continuous data. Trials varied in relation to the length of treatment 
      (4-26 weeks), dose, organisms and strengths of probiotics used. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a
      condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak.
      However, as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent longer
      term trials are recommended. Such research should focus on the type, optimal dose
      of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.

PG  - 209-14
LID - 10.1055/s-2008-1027702 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapy trials with bacterial compounds in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) have produced conflicting results and, so far, an E.-coli preparation has
      not been used. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-eight patients with lower
      abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the compound
      Symbioflor-2 (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an Escherichia coli product (N
      = 148), or placebo (n = 150) in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients
      were seen weekly by the physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS
      symptoms. Both an abdominal pain score (APS) as well as a general symptom score
      (GSS) were used as primary endpoints. Responders had to have complete absence of 
      IBS core symptoms at > or = 1 visit during treatment. RESULTS: The responder rate
      in GSS to the drug was 27 / 148 (18.2 %) in comparison to placebo with 7 / 150
      (4.67 %) (p = 0.000397). The improvement in APS was 28 / 148 (18.9 %) and 10 /
      150 (6.67 %) for placebo (p = 0.001649). The response was reached from visit 3
      onwards with both medication and placebo. Post-hoc analysis revealed no
      significant differences in efficacy of the drug between the gender and different 
      age groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment of IBS with the probiotic Symbioflor-2 is
      effective and superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients
      seen by general practitioners and by gastroenterologists.

      system in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 404-10
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2008.86 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional
      disorder. According to the Rome criteria, macroscopic and histological
      inflammation is a crucial exclusion criterion for IBS. Human defensins appear to 
      be part of the innate immune system in the gastrointestinal tract. Human
      beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) was the first inducible human antimicrobial protein
      discovered. The expression is induced by probiotic microorganisms and
      proinflammatory cytokines. Recent results imply that HBD-2 is expressed in active
      intestinal inflammation, especially in ulcerative colitis (UC). Our aim was to
      evaluate fecal measurements of HBD-2 in patients with active UC and IBS, and in
      healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from a total of
      100 participants (30 with active UC, 46 IBS, and 24 HCs). Exclusion criteria were
      the current use of probiotics and antibiotics. Furthermore, IBS patients with
      elevated C-reactive protein or leukocytes, a history of bacterial overgrowth or
      infectious gastrointestinal disease over the last 6 month were excluded. Disease 
      status was addressed in all participating subjects by medical history and current
      symptoms. In addition, each IBS and UC patient underwent ileocolonoscopy with
      histopathology. Fecal inflammation markers lactoferrin (Lf) and calprotectin
      (Cal) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reported as 
      microg/g. Fecal HBD-2 was measured by ELISA and reported as ng/g feces. In
      addition, immunoblots were performed for fecal HBD-2. Paraffin-embedded tissue
      from colonic biopsies was tested for HBD-2 peptides by immunohistochemistry.
      RESULTS: Lf as well as Cal was elevated in active UC (mean: 152.1+/-s.d. 374.7
      microg/g; 103.5+/-87.1 microg/g), compared with IBS (8.3+/-19.4 microg/g;
      18.6+/-23.3 microg/g), and HCs (0.4+/-0.5 microg/g; 7.1+/-7.9 microg/g). Scheffe 
      post hoc tests revealed significant differences (P=0.006; P<0.001) between active
      UC vs. IBS and HC. In contrast, HBD-2 levels were highest in active UC (mean:
      106.9+/-s.d. 91.5 ng/g), almost as high in IBS (pts 76.0+/-67.9 ng/g), and lowest
      for HCs (29.9+/-16.1 ng/g). Scheffe post hoc tests revealed significant
      differences (P<0.001) between the groups of patients (UC and IBS) vs. HCs.
      Immunohistochemical investigation was consistent with fecal secretion data and
      demonstrated the presence of beta-defensin 2 peptides in colonic epithelial
      enterocytes in UC as well as IBS patients with elevated fecal HBD-2. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results indicate significantly elevated levels of HBD-2 in patients with IBS 
      compared with HCs and similar to those with active UC. The results support an
      activation of the mucosal innate defense system toward a proinflammatory response
      in IBS patients in the absence of macroscopic signs of inflammation.

TI  - Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) in childhood.
PG  - CD003019
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003019.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies 
      for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on 
      physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed 
      by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions 
      for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE
      (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO 
      (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and
      JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were
      employed. Researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant
      studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any
      dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a
      diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II
      criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials
      for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies
      were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were
      included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre
      supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one
      study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled
      odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.26 (0.25,
      6.29). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983)
      compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a
      form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to 
      follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three
      trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation
      with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two
      (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided
      analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% 
      CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on
      the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that
      fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are
      effective in the management of children with RAP.

TI  - The impact of probiotic on gut health.
PG  - 68-78
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota plays an important role in host
      health due to its involvement in nutritional, immunologic and physiological
      functions. Microbial imbalances have been associated with enhanced risk of
      specific diseases. This observation has allowed the introduction of
      microorganisms as probiotics which are microbes with demonstrated health benefits
      in humans when ingested in foods. The mechanisms of action include the inhibition
      of pathogen growth by competition for nutritional sources and adhesion sites,
      secretion of antimicrobial substances, toxin inactivation. Consequently, the
      primary clinical interest in the application of probiotics has been in the
      prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea diseases. The well-characterized immunomodulatory potential of specific 
      probiotic strains, beyond the effect on the composition of the microbiota, has
      been be used as innovative tools to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize 
      gut mucosal dysfunction, and down-regulate hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical
      efficacy of specific probiotic strains has been demonstrated in, rotavirus's
      diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and food
      allergies. Further, recent clinical and nutritional studies have uncovered the
      function of specific strains in energy metabolism and thereby have opened up new 
      angles on their exploitation. However, as these processes are highly specific, it
      is important to characterize the properties of specific probiotic strains an in
      order to select the best strains or strain combinations for the target in
      question. Advances have prompted increased the interest of researchers and
      industry and new applications and targets are being discovered.

      syndrome.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.1159/000268131 [doi]
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that gastrointestinal immune activation may affect
      intestinal function and sensory perception, which contribute to symptom
      generation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The identification of
      higher counts of immunocytes (e.g. T cells and mast cells), mucosal and systemic 
      immune activation, and increased mucosal permeability in patients with IBS has
      stimulated interest in the potential development of therapeutic approaches aimed 
      at targeting the immune system and inflammation. Although an initial attempt in a
      pilot trial with steroids in patients with post-infective IBS failed, there has
      been renewed interest for mast cell stabilizers and the therapeutic potential of 
      aminosalicylates. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot
      trial assessed the effect of mesalazine on intestinal immune cells and symptom
      perception in patients with IBS. Mesalazine markedly reduced mucosal immune cells
      and mast cells in particular, compared to placebo. In addition, mesalazine
      significantly improved general well-being. Mesalazine may enhance epithelial
      barrier function, and preliminary data suggest that it may alter faecal bacterial
      profiles in IBS patients. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism through which this
      drug affects immune activation in the intestine of patients with IBS remains
      unknown. There is a need for further studies to prove the efficacy of mesalazine 
      for IBS. Further studies aimed at assessing the role of aminosalicylates and
      other approaches with potential anti-inflammatory activity, including probiotics,
      non-absorbable antibiotics, histamine receptor antagonists and protease
      inhibitors on IBS symptoms or pathophysiology are now warranted.

TI  - The role of pathogenic microbes and commensal bacteria in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 85-9
LID - 10.1159/000268126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) reflects several pathogenetic entities
      including a subgroup with low-grade colonic inflammation. We propose that
      pathogenic bacteria act as triggers and that disturbances of commensal bacteria
      maintain low-grade inflammation, that in turn leads to dysfunction in the gut or 
      brain. METHODS: Studies were performed in mice under specific pathogen-free
      conditions. Visceral pain was assessed by the visceromotor response and motility 
      was assessed by in vivo fluoroscopy and in vitro by muscle contractility. Brain
      chemistry was assessed by in situ hybridization and behavior by standard tests.
      The microbiota was monitored using 16s-based RT-PCR and DGGE. RESULTS: Mice
      transiently infected with the nematode Trichinella spiralis exhibited changes in 
      motility and in visceral perception that persisted for up to 6 weeks
      post-infection. This was accompanied by alterations in the microbiota and an
      upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 which could be reversed by treatment with
      anti-inflammatory agents or selected probiotics. To investigate the contribution 
      of the microbiota, we treated mice with oral antibiotics and monitored visceral
      perception and behavior. Antibiotic therapy produced substantial changes in the
      microbiota, a small increment in inflammatory activity and an increase in
      substance P or pain perception. Oral, but not systemic antibiotic treatment,
      produced changes in brain chemistry and an increase in anxiety-like behavior.
      CONCLUSION: These studies provide proof of concept that pathogenic microbes can
      induce persistent gut dysfunction and that changes in microbial composition of
      the gut can maintain gut dysfunction as well as induce behavioral changes
      reminiscent of the psychiatric comorbidity that occurs in up to 60% of irritable 
      bowel syndrome patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic
      review was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May
      2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases
      were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW
      (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra
      information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing
      probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any
      acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in
      abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and
      data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were
      synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous
      data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random
      effects models. RESULTS: 19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were
      identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate
      methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There
      were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable.
      Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not
      improving=0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT)=4 (95%
      CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=28.3, p=0.001,
      I(2)=68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351
      patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD=-0.34;
      95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity
      (chi(2)=67.04, p<0.001, I(2)=79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial. 
      CONCLUSION: Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of
      benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy 
      of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic
      microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44
      patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel
      crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either
      3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored 
      weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal
      microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global
      assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
      RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 
      0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters
      monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency
      (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score
      of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly
      improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut
      bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These
      findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on abdominal distension and gastrointestinal
      transit in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03853.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in
      girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed
      transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with
      acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with 
      constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control
      product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms
      were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS:
      Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant
      reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference -
      39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension
      during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal 
      [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P =
      0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P =
      0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in
      objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as
      reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit 
      is a useful strategy for treating distension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To
      investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms
      of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS.
      METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria,
      participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising
      two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB
      30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum
      CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8
      weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly
      during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A
      significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in
      scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was 
      observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the
      probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain
      probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.
