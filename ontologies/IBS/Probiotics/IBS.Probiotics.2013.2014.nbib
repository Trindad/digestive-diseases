TI  - Effects of a kefir supplement on symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel
      satisfaction score in patients with chronic constipation: a pilot study.
PG  - 650-6
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.6990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although probiotics have been extensively studied in irritable
      bowel syndrome, data on the impact of probiotics on chronic constipation are
      scarce. We aimed to evaluate the effects of kefir, which is a probiotic fermented
      milk product, on the symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel satisfaction scores of 
      patients with chronic constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive
      patients with functional constipation according to the Rome II criteria were
      divided into two groups based on their colon transit studies: 1. The normal
      transit (NT) group (n=10); and 2. The slow transit (ST) group (n=10). After a
      baseline period, 500 mL/day of a probiotic kefir beverage was administered to all
      patients for 4 weeks. Defecation parameters (stool frequency, stool consistency, 
      degree of straining, laxative consumption) were recorded in diaries daily by the 
      patients. Bowel satisfaction scores were assessed using a visual analog scale.
      The colon transit study was repeated in the ST group at the end of the study.
      RESULTS: At the end of the study, the patients showed an increased stool
      frequency (p<0.001), improved stool consistency (p=0.014), and decreased laxative
      consumption (p=0.031). The degree of straining during evacuation showed a
      tendency to improve after kefir administration; however, this was not
      statistically significant (p=0.18). A repeat transit study showed an acceleration
      of colonic transit in the ST group (p=0.013). Bowel satisfaction scores also
      improved (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that kefir has positive
      effects on the symptoms of constipation. Our results also suggest that kefir
      improves bowel satisfaction scores and accelerates colonic transit. Controlled
      trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate clinical symptoms in subjects with irritable
      bowel syndrome receiving Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Overall, 179 adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome (Rome III criteria) were randomized to receive once daily 500 mg
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, delivered by one capsule (n = 86, F: 84%, age: 42.5 
      +/- 12.5), or placebo (n = 93, F: 88%, age: 45.4 +/- 14) for 8 weeks followed by 
      a 3-week washout period. After a 2-week run-in period, cardinal symptoms
      (abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distension, bowel movement difficulty) and
      changes in stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily and assessed each 
      week. A safety assessment was carried out throughout the study. RESULTS: The
      proportion of responders, defined by an improvement of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      was significantly higher (p = 0.04) in the treated group than the placebo group
      (63% vs 47%, OR = 1.88, 95%, CI: 0.99-3.57) in the last 4 weeks of treatment. A
      non-significant trend of improvement was observed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      for the other symptoms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was well tolerated and did not
      affect stool frequency and consistency. CONCLUSION: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
      well tolerated and reduces abdominal pain/discomfort scores without stool
      modification. Thus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be a new promising candidate for
      improving abdominal pain in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Ehealth: low FODMAP diet vs Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 16215-26
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i43.16215 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of a low fermentable, oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) and the probiotic
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      Randomised, unblinded controlled trial on the effect of 6-wk treatment with LFD, 
      LGG or a normal Danish/Western diet (ND) in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome III
      diagnostic criteria, recruited between November 2009 and April 2013. Patients
      were required to complete on a weekly basis the IBS severity score system
      (IBS-SSS) and IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) questionnaires in a specially
      developed IBS web self-monitoring application. We investigated whether LFD or LGG
      could reduce IBS-SSS and improve QOL in IBS patients. RESULTS: One hundred
      twenty-three patients (median age 37 years, range: 18-74 years), 90 (73%) females
      were randomised: 42 to LFD, 41 to LGG and 40 to ND. A significant reduction in
      mean +/- SD of IBS-SSS from baseline to week 6 between LFD vs LGG vs ND was
      revealed: 133 +/- 122 vs 68 +/- 107, 133 +/- 122 vs 34 +/- 95, P < 0.01. Adjusted
      changes of IBS-SSS for baseline covariates showed statistically significant
      reduction of IBS-SSS in LFD group compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 75; 95%CI:
      24-126, P < 0.01), but not in LGG compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 32; 95%CI: 18-80,
      P = 0.20). IBS-QOL was not altered significantly in any of the three groups: mean
      +/- SD in LFD 8 +/- 18 vs LGG 7 +/- 17, LFD 8 +/- 18 vs ND 0.1 +/- 15, P = 0.13. 
      CONCLUSION: Both LFD and LGG are efficatious in patients with IBS.

AB  - Although it is now known that the human body is colonized by a wide variety of
      microbial populations in different parts (such as the mouth, pharynx and
      respiratory system, the skin, the gastro- and urogenital tracts), many effects of
      the complex interactions between the human host and microbial symbionts are still
      not completely understood. The dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota
      is considered to be one of the most important contributing factors in the
      development of many gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease,
      irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like
      obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fecal
      microbial transplantations appear to be promising therapies for
      dysbiosis-associated diseases; however, probiotic microorganisms have been
      growing in popularity due to increasing numbers of studies proving that certain
      strains present health promoting properties, among them the beneficial balance of
      the intestinal microbiota. Inflammatory bowel diseases and obesity are the
      pathologies in which there are more studies showing this beneficial association
      using animal models and even in human clinical trials. In this review, the
      association of the human gut microbiota and human health will be discussed along 
      with the benefits that probiotics can confer on this symbiotic activity and on
      the prevention or treatment of associated diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may help resolve bowel symptoms and improve quality of
      life. We investigated the effects of 12 weeks of probiotics administration in
      colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. The participants took probiotics (Lacidofil) or placebo
      twice a day for 12 weeks. The cancer-related quality of life (FACT), patient's
      health-9 (PHQ-9), and bowel symptom questionnaires were completed by each
      participant. RESULTS: We obtained data for 32 participants in the placebo group
      and 28 participants in the probiotics group. The mean ages of total participants 
      were 56.18 +/- .86 years and 58.3% were male. Administration of probiotics
      significantly decreased the proportion of patients suffering from irritable bowel
      symptoms (0 week vs. 12 week; 67.9% vs. 45.7%, p=0.03), improved colorectal
      cancer-related FACT (baseline vs. 12 weeks: 19.79 +/- 4.66 vs. 21.18 +/- 3.67,
      p=0.04) and fatigue-related FACT (baseline vs. 12 weeks: 43.00 (36.50-45.50) vs. 
      44.50 (38.50-49.00), p=0.02) and PHQ-9 scores (0 weeks vs. 12 weeks; 3.00
      (0-8.00) vs. 1.00 (0-3.00), p=0.01). We found significant differences in changes 
      of the proportion of patients with bowel symptoms (p<0.05), functional well-being
      scores (p=0.04) and cancer-related FACT scores (p=0.04) between the two groups.
      CONCLUSION: Probiotics improved bowel symptoms and quality of life in colorectal 
      cancer survivors.

TI  - Intestinal permeability--a new target for disease prevention and therapy.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12876-014-0189-7 [doi]
AB  - Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier
      and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are
      poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical
      significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge
      on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. 
      First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are 
      defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting
      permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where
      billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand,
      an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of
      microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb
      essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex
      anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the
      functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the 
      regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In
      particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut,
      infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other
      lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess 
      intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary
      enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier.
      The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this
      functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other
      environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated
      with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory
      bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more
      recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are
      characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of
      luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a
      feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of
      relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more
      attention.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota in health and disease: role of bifidobacteria in gut
      homeostasis.
PG  - 15163-76
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i41.15163 [doi]
AB  - The pool of microbes inhabiting our body is known as "microbiota" and their
      collective genomes as "microbiome". The colon is the most densely populated organ
      in the human body, although other parts, such as the skin, vaginal mucosa, or
      respiratory tract, also harbour specific microbiota. This microbial community
      regulates some important metabolic and physiological functions of the host, and
      drives the maturation of the immune system in early life, contributing to its
      homeostasis during life. Alterations of the intestinal microbiota can occur by
      changes in composition (dysbiosis), function, or microbiota-host interactions and
      they can be directly correlated with several diseases. The only disease in which 
      a clear causal role of a dysbiotic microbiota has been demonstrated is the case
      of Clostridium difficile infections. Nonetheless, alterations in composition and 
      function of the microbiota have been associated with several gastrointestinal
      diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, or irritable bowel
      syndrome), as well as extra-intestinal pathologies, such as those affecting the
      liver, or the respiratory tract (e.g., allergy, bronchial asthma, and cystic
      fibrosis), among others. Species of Bifidobacterium genus are the normal
      inhabitants of a healthy human gut and alterations in number and composition of
      their populations is one of the most frequent features present in these diseases.
      The use of probiotics, including bifidobacteria strains, in preventive medicine
      to maintain a healthy intestinal function is well documented. Probiotics are also
      proposed as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders and other
      pathologies. The World Gastroenterology Organization recently published potential
      clinical applications for several probiotic formulations, in which species of
      lactobacilli are predominant. This review is focused on probiotic preparations
      containing Bifidobacterium strains, alone or in combination with other bacteria, 
      which have been tested in human clinical studies. In spite of extensive
      literature on and research into this topic, the degree of scientific evidence of 
      the effectiveness of probiotics is still insufficient in most cases. More effort 
      need to be made to design and conduct accurate human studies demonstrating the
      efficacy of probiotics in the prevention, alleviation, or treatment of different 
      pathologies.

LID - 10.5604/17322693.1127882 [doi]
AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

TI  - Bloating and functional gastro-intestinal disorders: where are we and where are
      we going?
PG  - 14407-19
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i39.14407 [doi]
AB  - Bloating is one of the most common and bothersome symptoms complained by a large 
      proportion of patients. This symptom has been described with various definitions,
      such as sensation of a distended abdomen or an abdominal tension or even
      excessive gas in the abdomen, although bloating should probably be defined as the
      feeling (e.g. a subjective sensation) of increased pressure within the abdomen.
      It is usually associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders, like
      irritable bowel syndrome, but when bloating is not part of another functional
      bowel or gastrointestinal disorder it is included as an independent entity in
      Rome III criteria named functional bloating. In terms of diagnosis, major
      difficulties are due to the lack of measurable parameters to assess and grade
      this symptom. In addition, it is still unclear to what extent the individual
      patient complaint of subjective bloating correlates with the objective evidence
      of abdominal distension. In fact, despite its clinical, social and economic
      relevance, bloating lacks a clear pathophysiology explanation, and an effective
      management endorsement, turning this common symptom into a true challenge for
      both patients and clinicians. Different theories on bloating etiology call into
      questions an increased luminal contents (gas, stools, liquid or fat) and/or an
      impaired abdominal empting and/or an altered intra-abdominal volume displacement 
      (abdomino-phrenic theory) and/or an increased perception of intestinal stimuli
      with a subsequent use of empirical treatments (diet modifications, antibiotics
      and/or probiotics, prokinetic drugs, antispasmodics, gas reducing agents and
      tricyclic antidepressants). In this review, our aim was to review the latest
      knowledge on bloating physiopathology and therapeutic options trying to shed
      lights on those processes where a clinician could intervene to modify disease
      course.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a microbiome-gut-brain axis disorder?
PG  - 14105-25
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i39.14105 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an extremely prevalent but poorly understood
      gastrointestinal disorder. Consequently, there are no clear diagnostic markers to
      help diagnose the disorder and treatment options are limited to management of the
      symptoms. The concept of a dysregulated gut-brain axis has been adopted as a
      suitable model for the disorder. The gut microbiome may play an important role in
      the onset and exacerbation of symptoms in the disorder and has been extensively
      studied in this context. Although a causal role cannot yet be inferred from the
      clinical studies which have attempted to characterise the gut microbiota in IBS, 
      they do confirm alterations in both community stability and diversity. Moreover, 
      it has been reliably demonstrated that manipulation of the microbiota can
      influence the key symptoms, including abdominal pain and bowel habit, and other
      prominent features of IBS. A variety of strategies have been taken to study these
      interactions, including probiotics, antibiotics, faecal transplantations and the 
      use of germ-free animals. There are clear mechanisms through which the microbiota
      can produce these effects, both humoral and neural. Taken together, these
      findings firmly establish the microbiota as a critical node in the gut-brain axis
      and one which is amenable to therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Beliefs about management of irritable bowel syndrome in primary care:
      cross-sectional survey in one locality.
PG  - 263-9
LID - 10.1017/S1463423614000383 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine beliefs about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management among
      primary care physicians. BACKGROUND: There have been considerable advances in
      evidence synthesis concerning management of IBS in the last five years, with
      guidelines for its management in primary care published by the National Institute
      for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional
      web-based questionnaire survey of 275 primary care physicians. We emailed a link 
      to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire, containing 18 items, to all eligible primary
      care physicians registered with three clinical commissioning groups in Leeds, UK.
      Participants were given one month to respond, with a reminder sent out after two 
      weeks. FINDINGS: One-hundred and two (37.1%) primary care physicians responded.
      Among responders, 70% believed IBS was a diagnosis of exclusion, and >80% checked
      coeliac serology often or always in suspected IBS. Between >50% and >70% believed
      soluble fibre, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and psychological therapies were
      potentially efficacious therapies. The respondents were less convinced that
      antidepressants or probiotics were effective. Despite perceived efficacy of
      psychological therapies, 80% stated these were not easily available. Levels of
      use of soluble fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were in the range of 40%
      to >50%. Most primary care physicians obtained up-to-date evidence about IBS
      management from NICE guidelines. Most primary care physicians still believe IBS
      is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many are reluctant to use antidepressants or
      probiotics to treat IBS. More research studies addressing diagnosis and treatment
      of IBS based in primary are required.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.258 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation are prevalent 
      and burdensome gastrointestinal disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
      of the evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and chronic
      idiopathic constipation has recently been performed. By far, the most convincing 
      evidence was for the use of probiotics in IBS, which reported that overall
      probiotics reduced the risk of symptom persistence by 21%. However, only a
      minority of the trials were at a low risk of bias, and some used small sample
      sizes. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to combine individual small trials to
      improve the power to detect the direction, size, and consistency of an effect,
      but it can do little to overcome the poor design of individual trials. Many
      debate the use of meta-analysis to combine data from different probiotic species,
      strains, or combinations. It is recommended that all future meta-analyses of
      probiotics, in any clinical setting, perform subgroup analysis on specific
      species/strains and specific combinations. It is hoped that the current
      meta-analysis will empower clinicians in making evidence-based decisions
      regarding whether probiotics should be recommended for IBS, which
      species/strain(s) to use, and for which symptoms.

TI  - The use of probiotics in IBD and IBS.
PG  - 491-500
AB  - While the role of microflora is well established in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBS); data is still emerging regarding IBS as the
      knowledge on brain-gut interaction grows. For both patient groups multiple
      efficacious treatments exist, but there are still unmet needs as long term
      disease control remains an issue. Given the importance of the microbiome on the
      development of the immune system and the interaction between the microbiome and
      the host organism, this "route" is being examined increasingly as a therapeutic
      possibility in both pathologies with variable results. We here provide a short
      overview on the existing data, meta-analysis and single studies, on probiotic
      treatment in both diseases.

TI  - Changes of the human gut microbiome induced by a fermented milk product.
PG  - 6328
LID - 10.1038/srep06328 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota (GM) consists of resident commensals and transient microbes
      conveyed by the diet but little is known about the role of the latter on GM
      homeostasis. Here we show, by a conjunction of quantitative metagenomics, in
      silico genome reconstruction and metabolic modeling, that consumption of a
      fermented milk product containing dairy starters and Bifidobacterium animalis
      potentiates colonic short chain fatty acids production and decreases abundance of
      a pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia compared to a milk product in subjects with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, n = 28). The GM changes parallel improvement of
      IBS state, suggesting a role of the fermented milk bacteria in gut homeostasis.
      Our data challenge the view that microbes ingested with food have little impact
      on the human GM functioning and rather provide support for beneficial health
      effects.

AB  - Accumulating clinical evidence supports co-morbidity of irritable bowel,
      irritable eye and irritable mind symptoms. Furthermore, perturbation of the
      microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism
      connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consequently, 
      maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to
      treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. Current treatment approach
      assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with
      prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the
      symbiosis. However, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed
      probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic
      symptoms. Recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept
      study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins A, B, D and 
      omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. These findings suggested a
      conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as
      targets for intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common diagnosis in
      gastroenterology. Its etiology is unknown and therapeutic options limited. Trials
      suggest probiotics may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to assess the
      symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v (L. plantarum 299 v) for
      the relief of abdominal pain in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome II criteria.
      METHODS: This study was conducted in a referral hospital. Trial participants were
      randomized to receive either two capsules of L. plantarum 299 v at a dosage of 5 
      x 10(9) cfu per capsule or placebo daily for 8 wk. Severity of abdominal pain was
      assessed using a visual analog scale at each visit and a quality-of-life IBS
      (QoL-IBS) questionnaire was also completed. RESULTS: There was no significant
      difference in abdominal pain relief between the study and placebo groups (P =
      0.800). There was also no difference in QoL- IBS scores between the groups (P =
      0.687). Both groups had a significant improvement in abdominal pain scores over
      the study period, from an average of 251.55 to 197.90 (P < 0.0001) indicating a
      large placebo effect. CONCLUSION: An 8-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299 v did
      not provide symptomatic relief, particularly of abdominal pain and bloating, in
      patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria.

      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 430-6
LID - 10.4161/gmic.29796 [doi]
AB  - The last ten years' wide progress in the gut microbiota phylogenetic and
      functional characterization has been made evidencing dysbiosis in several
      gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gut disease with high prevalence and
      negative impact on patient's quality of life characterized mainly by visceral
      pain and/or discomfort, representing a good paradigm of chronic gut
      hypersensitivity. The IBS features are strongly regulated by bidirectional
      gut-brain interactions and there is increasing evidence for the involvement of
      gut bacteria and/or their metabolites in these features, including visceral pain.
      Further, gut microbiota modulation by antibiotics or probiotics has been
      promising in IBS. Mechanistic data provided mainly by animal studies highlight
      that commensals or probiotics may exert a direct action through bacterial
      metabolites on sensitive nerve endings in the gut mucosa, or indirect pathways
      targeting the intestinal epithelial barrier, the mucosal and/or systemic immune
      activation, and subsequent neuronal sensitization and/or activation.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: the problem and the problem of treating it - is there a
      role for probiotics?
PG  - 470-6
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114000706 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) in those patients who consult the medical profession and examine the
      therapeutic potential of probiotics in this condition, where there is a strong
      need for new treatment options. Traditionally, IBS is frequently regarded as a
      trivial condition which is certainly not life threatening and mainly
      psychological in origin. However, these preconceptions are misplaced, as in some 
      patients the condition can be devastating with the pain being as severe as that
      of childbirth coupled with incapacitating bowel dysfunction. In addition,
      patients suffer from a variety of non-colonic symptoms such as low backache,
      constant lethargy, nausea and genito-urinary problems, all of which lead to these
      patients having extremely poor quality of life. Unfortunately, the treatment of
      IBS is very unsatisfactory with only one new medication being developed for this 
      condition in the last 25 years. It is now recognised that IBS is a multifactorial
      condition with symptoms being triggered by a variety of factors, some of which
      appear to be influenced by probiotics, resulting in speculation that they may
      have therapeutic potential in this condition. There have been over thirty
      controlled clinical trials of probiotics in IBS with approximately two-thirds of 
      these studies showing evidence of an improvement in symptoms. However, not all
      probiotics appear to be effective with different symptoms being improved by
      different strains and some improving symptoms more than others. Consequently, the
      ideal probiotic for the treatment of IBS has yet to be defined, but the evidence 
      is good enough to encourage further research with the aim of identifying an
      optimal strain or strains.

      probiotics and plant sterols.
PG  - 254-62
LID - 10.1017/S1463423614000280 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this research is to explore whether general practitioners
      have experiences with functional foods within their clinical practice.
      BACKGROUND: Previous research and editorials have suggested that general
      practitioners should have more involvement and knowledge of functional foods.
      This is due to the thought that functional foods may be consumed by their
      patients that could lead to other issues, such as patients not taking their
      medication. Therefore, research into general practitioners involvement with
      functional foods needs to be conducted. METHOD: In all, 10 semi-structured open
      interviews were used with a topic guide. These interviews where digitally audio
      recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts where analysed using thematic 
      analysis. FINDINGS: It was found that general practitioners believed they did not
      have a direct role with functional foods and should not be involved with
      discussing them with their patients. They felt that if they where to be involved 
      with functional foods then they would need more training and information about
      them. They also felt that functional foods could be empowering for their
      patients.

TI  - Melatonin regulation as a possible mechanism for probiotic (VSL#3) in irritable
      bowel syndrome: a randomized double-blinded placebo study.
PG  - 186-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3299-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have treatment efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      but the exact mechanism remains obscure. One hypothesis is the mediation of
      melatonin levels, leading to changes in IBS symptoms. AIM: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic, VSL#3, on symptoms,
      psychological and sleep parameters, and pain sensitivity in IBS, and relate these
      parameters to in vivo melatonin levels. METHODS: Forty-two IBS patients were
      randomly assigned to receive VSL#3 or placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects completed
      bowel and psychological questionnaires, underwent rectal sensitivity testing and 
      saliva melatonin assays. RESULTS: Abdominal pain duration and distension
      intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic group, along with an increase 
      in rectal distension pain thresholds. A correlation between increase in pain
      tolerance and improvement in abdominal pain scores (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) was seen 
      with probiotic. There was an increase in salivary morning melatonin levels in
      males treated with VSL#3, which correlated (r = 0.61) with improved satisfaction 
      in bowel habits. When grouped based on baseline diurnal melatonin levels,
      patients with normal diurnal fluctuations showed an increase in morning melatonin
      levels with VSL#3 treatment, which significantly correlated with improved
      satisfaction in bowel habits (r = 0.68). They also had reduced symptom severity
      scores and abdominal pain duration when treated with VSL#3, as well as
      satisfaction with bowel movements and quality-of-life. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3
      improved symptoms and increased rectal pain thresholds. Symptom improvement
      correlated with a rise in morning melatonin, significant in males and subjects
      with normal circadian rhythm. This suggests that probiotics may act by
      influencing melatonin production, hence modulating IBS symptoms, in individuals
      with a normal circadian rhythm.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder without any
      structural or metabolic abnormalities that sufficiently explain the symptoms,
      which include abdominal pain and discomfort, and bowel habit changes such as
      diarrhea and constipation. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial: visceral
      hypersensitivity, dysmotility, psychosocial factors, genetic or environmental
      factors, dysregulation of the brain-gut axis, and altered intestinal microbiota
      have all been proposed as possible causes. The human intestinal microbiota are
      composed of more than 1000 different bacterial species and 10(14) cells, and are 
      essential for the development, function, and homeostasis of the intestine, and
      for individual health. The putative mechanisms that explain the role of
      microbiota in the development of IBS include altered composition or metabolic
      activity of the microbiota, mucosal immune activation and inflammation, increased
      intestinal permeability and impaired mucosal barrier function, sensory-motor
      disturbances provoked by the microbiota, and a disturbed gut-microbiota-brain
      axis. Therefore, modulation of the intestinal microbiota through dietary changes,
      and use of antibiotics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents has been
      suggested as strategies for managing IBS symptoms. This review summarizes and
      discusses the accumulating evidence that intestinal microbiota play a role in the
      pathophysiology and management of IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, sometimes debilitating,
      gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. While altered gut motility and sensation, as
      well as aberrant brain perception of visceral events, are thought to contribute
      to the genesis of symptoms in IBS, a search for an underlying aetiology has, to
      date, proven unsuccessful. Recently, attention has been focused on the microbiota
      as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of IBS. Prompted by a number of clinical
      observations, such as the recognition of the de novo development of IBS following
      enteric infections, as well as descriptions of changes in colonic bacterial
      populations in IBS and supported by clinical responses to interventions, such as 
      antibiotics and probiotics, that modify the microbiota, various approaches have
      been taken to investigating the microbiota-host response in IBS, as well as in
      animal models thereof. From such studies a considerable body of evidence has
      accumulated to indicate the activation or upregulation of both factors involved
      in bacterial engagement with the host as well host defence mechanisms against
      bacteria. Alterations in gut barrier function, occurring in response, or in
      parallel, to changes in the microbiota, have also been widely described and can
      be seen to play a pivotal role in generating and sustaining host immune responses
      both within and beyond the gut. In this manner a plausible hypothesis, based on
      an altered microbiota and/or an aberrant host response, for the pathogenesis, of 
      at least some instances of IBS, can be generated.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders causing patients to seek medical treatment. It is relatively resource
      intensive and the source of significant morbidity. Recent insights into the
      pathophysiology and treatment of IBS has given clinicians more options than ever 
      to contend with this disorder. The purpose of our paper is to review older,
      "classic" treatments for IBS as well as newer agents and "alternative" therapies.
      We discuss the evidence base of these drugs and provide context to help develop
      appropriate treatment plans for IBS patients.

PG  - 1547-61; quiz 1546, 1562
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.202 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC) are functional bowel disorders. Evidence suggests that disturbance in the
      gastrointestinal microbiota may be implicated in both conditions. We performed a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of prebiotics,
      probiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and CIC. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (up to December 2013).
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with IBS or CIC, which
      compared prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics with placebo or no therapy, were
      eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of 
      remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
      Continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference with
      a 95% CI. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3,216 citations. Forty-three
      RCTs were eligible for inclusion. The RR of IBS symptoms persisting with
      probiotics vs. placebo was 0.79 (95% CI 0.70-0.89). Probiotics had beneficial
      effects on global IBS, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence scores. Data for 
      prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS were sparse. Probiotics appeared to have
      beneficial effects in CIC (mean increase in number of stools per week=1.49; 95%
      CI=1.02-1.96), but there were only two RCTs. Synbiotics also appeared beneficial 
      (RR of failure to respond to therapy=0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.92). Again, trials for
      prebiotics were few in number, and no definite conclusions could be drawn.
      CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are effective treatments for IBS, although which
      individual species and strains are the most beneficial remains unclear. Further
      evidence is required before the role of prebiotics or synbiotics in IBS is known.
      The efficacy of all three therapies in CIC is also uncertain.

TI  - Infectious diarrhea: an overview.
PG  - 399
LID - 10.1007/s11894-014-0399-8 [doi]
AB  - Diarrheal disease, which is most often caused by infectious pathogens, is a
      significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children.
      This is particularly true in developing countries. Recent outbreaks of infectious
      diarrhea in developed countries, including the USA, are often attributed to food 
      handling and distribution practices and highlight the need for continued
      vigilance in this area. Another common cause of infectious diarrhea, Clostridium 
      difficile infection (CDI), has historically been associated with the use of
      antibiotics and exposure to a health-care setting but is now increasingly common 
      in the community in persons who lack the typical risk factors. Recent scientific 
      advances have also led to new and proposed new therapies for infectious diarrhea,
      including fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for recurrent C. difficile infection 
      (RCDI), probiotics for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and
      CDI, and the use of zinc supplementation in the treatment of acute diarrhea in
      children. Other therapies that have been in use for decades, such as the oral
      rehydration solution (ORS), continue to be the targets of scientific advancement 
      in an effort to improve delivery and efficacy. Finally, post-infectious irritable
      bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is an increasingly recognized occurrence. Attempts to
      understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon are underway and may provide
      insight into potential treatment options.

AB  - AIM: To determine the dose-related effects of a novel probiotic combination,
      I.31, on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-related quality of life (IBS-QoL).
      METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention
      clinical trial with three parallel arms was designed. A total of 84 patients (53 
      female, 31 male; age range 20-70 years) with IBS and diarrhea according to
      Rome-III criteria were randomly allocated to receive one capsule a day for 6 wk
      containing: (1) I.31 high dose (n = 28); (2) I.31 low dose (n = 27); and (3)
      placebo (n = 29). At baseline, and 3 and 6 wk of treatment, patients filled the
      IBSQoL, Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI), and global symptom relief
      questionnaires. RESULTS: During treatment, IBS-QoL increased in all groups, but
      this increment was significantly larger in patients treated with I.31 than in
      those receiving placebo (P = 0.008). After 6 wk of treatment, IBS-QoL increased
      by 18 +/- 3 and 22 +/- 4 points in the high and the low dose groups, respectively
      (P = 0.041 and P = 0.023 vs placebo), but only 9 +/- 3 in the placebo group.
      Gut-specific anxiety, as measured with VSI, also showed a significantly greater
      improvement after 6 wk of treatment in patients treated with probiotics (by 10
      +/- 2 and 14 +/- 2 points, high and low dose respectively, P < 0.05 for both vs 7
      +/- 1 score increment in placebo). Symptom relief showed no significant changes
      between groups. No adverse drug reactions were reported following the consumption
      of probiotic or placebo capsules. CONCLUSION: A new combination of three
      different probiotic bacteria was superior to placebo in improving IBS-related
      quality of life in patients with IBS and diarrhea.

TI  - Clinical approach to visceral pain in irritable bowel syndrome - pathophysiology,
      symptoms, and treatment.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - Visceral pain has been defined as a pain resulting from activation of pain
      receptors localized in mucous membrane, serous membrane, and smooth muscles of
      hollow organs. The great majority of these organs are innervated by
      parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows. Afferent nerve fibres are involved in
      conduction of both acute and persistent pain and hyperalgesia. Visceral pain
      differs significantly from other types of pain in the way it originates and in
      clinical presentation. It can be misleading as a symptom, producing several
      problems in the diagnostic process. Sometimes, severe visceral pain is observed
      in the course of non-lifethreatening functional gastrointestinal disorders, while
      slight abdominal discomfort may be a first symptom of malignant tumours. For many
      years, the treatment of visceral pain has been considered as not satisfactory
      enough and covered a wide variety of pharmacological substances. For example, the
      complex therapy of pain and other manifestations associated with irritable bowel 
      syndrome include psychotherapy/behavioural therapy, bulk-forming agents,
      probiotics, laxatives, antidiarrheals, antibacterial agents, antispasmodics, and 
      antidepressants. The current knowledge about the pathogenesis of visceral pain
      gives a rationale for the development of new, more efficacious drugs with a
      positive benefit/risk ratio. Unfortunately, experience gained so far with the use
      of some agents affecting serotoninergic transmission in the gastrointestinal
      tract have shown a serious danger associated with their administration for
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that host-microbe interactions play a key role in
      maintaining homeostasis. Alterations in gut microbial composition is associated
      with marked changes in behaviors relevant to mood, pain and cognition,
      establishing the critical importance of the bi-directional pathway of
      communication between the microbiota and the brain in health and disease.
      Dysfunction of the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been implicated in
      stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome
      and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Bacterial colonization of the
      gut is central to postnatal development and maturation of key systems that have
      the capacity to influence central nervous system (CNS) programming and signaling,
      including the immune and endocrine systems. Moreover, there is now expanding
      evidence for the view that enteric microbiota plays a role in early programming
      and later response to acute and chronic stress. This view is supported by studies
      in germ-free mice and in animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections,
      probiotic agents or antibiotics. Although communication between gut microbiota
      and the CNS are not fully elucidated, neural, hormonal, immune and metabolic
      pathways have been suggested. Thus, the concept of a microbiome-brain-gut axis is
      emerging, suggesting microbiota-modulating strategies may be a tractable
      therapeutic approach for developing novel treatments for CNS disorders.

PG  - 1593-609
LID - 10.1517/14712598.2014.937419 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Saccharomyces boulardii is a well-known probiotic worldwide, and
      there are numerous studies including experimental and clinical trials in children
      and adults by the use of S. boulardii. AREAS COVERED: The objective of the
      present report is to provide an update on the evidence for the efficacy of S.
      boulardii CNCM I-745 in different clinical conditions. Saccharomyces boulardii is
      one of the best-studied probiotics in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and is shown to
      be safe and to reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization by about 1
      day. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the recommended probiotics for AGE in
      children by European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).
      Saccharomyces boulardii is also a recommended probiotic for the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and a recent study showed promising results
      for the treatment of AAD in children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend
      the long-term use of S. boulardii in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
      Although some clinical studies showed positive effects of S. boulardii on
      inflammation, there is no clinical evidence that S. boulardii is useful in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Saccharomyces boulardii could be used in patients
      needing Helicobacter pylori eradication because the S. boulardii improves
      compliance, decreases the side effects and moderately increases the eradication
      rate. There are new promising results (improving feeding tolerance, shorten the
      course of hyperbilirubinemia), but we do still not recommend the routine use of
      S. boulardii in newborns. EXPERT OPINION: Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a
      good example for the statement that each probiotic needs to be taxonomically
      characterized and its efficacy and safety should be documented individually in
      different clinical settings.

      Iranian adults with irritable bowel syndrome and bloating.
PG  - 466-70
LID - 0141707/AIM.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in Iran with
      challenging treatment. Although trials have suggested that probiotics alleviate
      the complaints of patients with minimal side effects, they have not been
      investigated in Iranian adults. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind study, 108 
      eligible IBS patients (Rome III Criteria) aged 20 - 70 years who referred
      consecutively to a clinical center in Tehran with abdominal bloating from 2010 to
      2012 received a combination probiotics or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks. The
      objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multi-strain probiotics
      combination. One week prior to and throughout the treatment, the participants
      recorded their abdominal symptoms on a daily basis, using visual analogue scale
      and reported satisfactory relief of general symptoms at the end of each week.
      Adverse events were evaluated by self-reporting and physical examination.
      Continuous variables were analyzed by independent t-test and chi-square was used 
      for binomials. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were balanced (60% female,
      mean age 36.7 +/- 11.5). A total of 97 (51 intervention, 46 control) completed
      the treatment. Intention to treat analysis was done on 108 allocated subjects.
      85% of the probiotic group reported satisfactory relief of general symptoms
      compared with 47% in the control group (P < 0.01). A reduction in abdominal
      bloating and pain with probiotic was superior to placebo [-13.0 vs. -3.7 (P <
      0.01), -8.2 vs. -2.1 (P = 0.02), respectively]. No severe adverse drug reaction
      was seen in either group. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week period of treatment with the
      combination probiotics twice daily was safe, well tolerated, and effective in our
      patients. Further investigation is recommended for other subgroups of IBS. Trial 
      Registration: IRCT.ir IRCT2012071010230N1.

      "6-/6Tx": no treatment for the initial 6 months and treatment in the last 6
      months (n = 23); Group D = "12-": no treatment (n = 24). The patients of Groups A
      = "6Tx/6-" and B = "12Tx" had the highest frequency of chronic prostatitis (88.5%
      and 86.4%, respectively). In contrast, group "12-": patients had the lowest
      frequency of prostatitis (33.4%). The progression of prostatitis into PV in
      groups "6Tx/6-" (15.5%) and "6-/6Tx" (13.6%) was lower than that found in the
      patients of group "12-" (45.8%). Finally, no patient of groups "6Tx/6-" and
      "6-/6Tx" had PVE, whereas it was diagnosed in 20.8% of group "12-" patients.
      Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in
      lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male
      accessory gland infections in infertile patients with bacteriologically cured CBP
      plus IBS.

PG  - 6832-43
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i22.6832 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of the probiotic combination Lactibiane
      Tolerance((R)) (LT) on epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. METHODS:
      The effect of the multispecies probiotic LT was assessed on several models of
      epithelial barrier function both in vitro (in basal and inflammatory conditions) 
      and in vivo [visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress or by colonic
      perfusion of a fecal supernatant (FSN) from patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS)]. In vitro, we measured the permeability of confluent T84 cell
      monolayers incubated with or without LT by evaluating the paracellular flux of
      macromolecules, in basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) or with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM). 
      In vivo, male C57/Bl6 mice received orally NaCl or LT for 15 d and were submitted
      to water avoidance stress (WAS) before evaluating visceral sensitivity by
      measuring the myoelectrical activity of the abdominal muscle and the paracellular
      permeability with (51)Cr-EDTA. Permeability and sensitivity were also measured
      after colonic instillation of FSN. Tight-junctions were assessed by
      immunoblotting and TLR-4 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry
      RESULTS: Incubation of T84 cell monolayers with LT in basal conditions had no
      significant effect on permeability (P > 0.05 vs culture medium). By contrast,
      addition of LT bacterial bodies (LT) completely prevented the LPS-induced
      increase in paracellular permeability (P < 0.01 vs LPS 10 ng/mL (LPS 10); P <
      0.01 vs LPS 100 ng/mL (LPS 100), P > 0.05 vs culture medium). The effect was dose
      dependent as addition of 10(9) LT bacterial bodies induced a stronger decrease in
      absorbance than 10(6) LT (10(9) LT + LPS 10: -20.1% +/- 13.4, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10;
      10(6) LT + LPS 10: -11.6% +/- 6.2, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 10(9) LT + LPS 100: -14.4%
      +/- 5.5, P < 0.01 vs LPS 100; 10(6) LT + LPS 100: -11.6% +/- 7.3, P < 0.05 vs LPS
      100). Moreover, the increase in paracellular permeability induced by culturing
      T84 cells with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM) 
      was completely inhibited in the presence of 10(9) LT (P < 0.01 vs IBS-CM). LT
      also significantly prevented the epithelial disruption induced by intracolonic
      infusion of fecal supernatant from IBS patients (P < 0.01 vs IBS FSN) or water
      avoidance stress P < 0.01 vs WAS) in C57/Bl6 mice and increased the expression of
      occludin in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by immnunoblotting. The WAS-induced
      effect on visceral sensitivity was prevented by LT treatment since values
      obtained for all steps of colorectal distension were significantly (P < 0.01)
      different from the WAS group. Finally, LT down-regulated the response mediated
      through TLR-4 in vitro (decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in
      response to LPS: -65.8% for 10(9) LT and -52.5% for 10(6) LT, P < 0.01 vs LPS)
      and in vivo (inhibition of WAS induced an increase in TLR-4 expression in the LT 
      treated mice colon, P < 0.01 vs WAS). CONCLUSION: The probiotic LT mix prevented 
      the disruption to the epithelial barrier induced by LPS, stress or colonic
      soluble factors from IBS patients and prevented visceral hypersensitivity.

TI  - The microbiota-gut-brain axis in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 419-29
LID - 10.4161/gmic.29417 [doi]
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are highly prevalent and pose a
      significant burden on health care and society, and impact patients' quality of
      life. FGIDs comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders, with unclear underlying 
      pathophysiology. They are considered to result from the interaction of altered
      gut physiology and psychological factors via the gut-brain axis, where brain and 
      gut symptoms are reciprocally influencing each other's expression. Intestinal
      microbiota, as a part of the gut-brain axis, plays a central role in FGIDs.
      Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a prototype of FGIDs, display altered
      composition of the gut microbiota compared with healthy controls and benefit, at 
      the gastrointestinal and psychological levels, from the use of probiotics and
      antibiotics. This review aims to recapitulate the available literature on FGIDs
      and microbiota-gut-brain axis.

TI  - Therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota: current clinical applications and
      future perspectives.
PG  - 762-70
AB  - Human beings and gut microbiota are in a symbiotic relationship, and the
      hypothesis of a "super organism" composed of the human organism and microbes has 
      been recently proposed. The gut microbiota fulfills important metabolic and
      immunological tasks, and the impairment of its composition might alter
      homeostasis and lead to the development of microbiota-related diseases. The most 
      common illnesses associated with alterations of the gut microbiota include
      inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteric infections, irritable bowel syndrome
      and other gastrointestinal functional diseases, colorectal cancer, metabolic
      syndrome and obesity, liver diseases, allergic diseases, and neurological
      diseases such as autism. In theory, every disease associated with the impairment 
      of intestinal microflora might benefit from the therapeutic modulation of the gut
      microbiota. A number of attempts to manipulate the microbiota have not produced
      identical results for every disease. Although antibiotics and probiotics have
      been available for a long time, the so-called fecal microbiota transplantation,
      which is a very old remedy, was only recently re-evaluated as a promising
      therapeutic approach for microbiota impairment. A comprehensive understanding of 
      the gut microbiota composition, in states of both health and various diseases, is
      needed for the development of future approaches for microbiota modulation and for
      developing targeted therapies. In this review, we describe the role of the
      microbiota in several diseases and the related treatment options that are
      currently available.

PG  - 289-93
LID - 10.1007/s00482-014-1406-6 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      diseases. It is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, typically associated
      with altered bowel habits that cannot be explained by structural abnormalities in
      routine diagnostic workup. Based on the predominant symptom, IBS can be divided
      into different subtypes: IBS with predominant constipation, diarrhea, bloating,
      or pain. Knowledge about the complex and multifactorial IBS pathophysiology has
      increased tremendously in recent years, e.g., IBS may be related to alterations
      in gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, and the mucosal immune
      system. It is important, both for the patient and the physician, that IBS
      diagnosis is made quickly and thoroughly based on the typical symptom complex and
      exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses and to reassure the patient that IBS
      is a chronic, but benign disease. These components are the fundamental basis for 
      a good patient-physician relationship and for a successful long-term management
      of this potentially very compromising disorder. IBS therapy is based on general
      measures as well as symptom-oriented medical therapy, where improvement of
      abdominal pain is one of the main goals in treating IBS patients. Several pain
      treatment options are available, which may be used long-term or on demand and
      which may be combined with other therapies. General medical approaches include
      antispasmodics, improvement of bowel function, phytotherapy, and probiotics.
      Especially in patients with psychological comorbidities, antidepressants may be
      used. Modern drug treatments include the GC-C agonist linaclotide in IBS with
      predominant constipation, the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in IBS with
      bloating, and 5-HT3 antagonists in IBS with predominant diarrhea. Psychotherapy
      should be included in an interdisciplinary approach in refractory cases or in
      psychological comorbidity.

TI  - Does stress induce bowel dysfunction?
PG  - 583-5
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2014.911659 [doi]
AB  - Psychological stress is known to induce somatic symptoms. Classically, many gut
      physiological responses to stress are mediated by the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is, however, a growing body of
      evidence of stress-induced corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) release causing 
      bowel dysfunction through multiple pathways, either through the HPA axis, the
      autonomic nervous systems, or directly on the bowel itself. In addition, recent
      findings of CRF influencing the composition of gut microbiota lend support for
      the use of probiotics, antibiotics, and other microbiota-altering agents as
      potential therapeutic measures in stress-induced bowel dysfunction.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain
      (RAP) in children in both more developed and developing parts of the world. It is
      defined by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is
      characterized by abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and whose onset is
      associated with a change in stool form and or frequency and is not explained by
      structural or biochemical abnormalities. It is estimated that 10%-15% of older
      children and adolescents suffer from IBS. IBS can be considered to be a brain-gut
      disorder possibly due to complex interaction between environmental and hereditary
      factors. The diagnosis of IBS is made based on the Rome III criteria together
      with ruling out organic causes of RAP in children such as inflammatory bowel
      disease and celiac disease. Once the diagnosis of IBS is made, it is important to
      explain to the parents (and children) that there is no serious underlying
      disease. This reassurance may be effective treatment in a large number of cases. 
      Lifestyle modifications, stress management, dietary interventions and probiotics 
      may be beneficial in some cases. Although there is limited evidence for efficacy 
      of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and antidiarrheals; these
      have a role in severe cases. Biopsychosocial therapies have shown encouraging
      results in initial trials but are beset by limited availability. Further research
      is necessary to understand the pathophysiology and provide specific focused
      therapies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorder that affects 15-20% of the Western population. BACKGROUND: There are
      currently few therapeutic options available for the treatment of IBS. The aim of 
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a medical device
      containing a combination of Simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in the treatment
      of IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a monocentric double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial. Adult subjects suffering from
      IBS as defined by Rome III criteria were enrolled. Bloating, discomfort,
      abdominal pain were assessed as primary end point. Subjects received the active
      treatment or placebo 3 time a day after each meal for 4 weeks of study period.
      Subjects were submitted to visit at Day 0 (T1), at Days 14 (T2) and 29 (T3).
      RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included into the study. Intragroup analysis
      showed a significant reduction of the bloating, discomfort and pain in Colinox(R)
      group (CG) compared to placebo group (PG). Between group analysis confirmed, at
      T1-T3, significant differences between CG and PG in bloating and discomfort.
      DISCUSSION: Simethicone is an inert antifoaming able to reduce bloating,
      abdominal discomfort. Literature offers increasing evidence linking alterations
      in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS and it is well known that probiotics
      are important to restore the native gut microbiota. The Colinox medical device is
      specifically targeted against most intrusive symptom of IBS (bloating) and it is 
      also able to counteract the most accredited ethiopathogenetic factor in IBS
      (alterations of intestinal microbiota). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy and
      safety of a combination of simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in treatment of
      IBS.

AB  - Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a
      challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain
      specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results
      in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit
      their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line
      therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have
      been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable 
      carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to
      reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence
      for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy 
      of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different
      quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint
      oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS.
      Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although 
      the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis.
      In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion
      stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist
      that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the
      stool pattern.

PG  - 51-62

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of interactions between the host and gut microbiota in
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is becoming increasingly
      apparent. Probiotics offer a potential new treatment for IBS, but current results
      are conflicting, largely as a result of poorly designed trials and
      nonstandardisation of outcome measures. AIM: To assess the efficacy of a liquid, 
      multi-strain probiotic (Symprove) in IBS. METHODS: A single-centre, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with symptomatic IBS.
      Patients received 12 weeks of treatment with the probiotic or placebo (1
      mL/kg/day). The primary efficacy measure was the difference in change in the IBS 
      symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) between probiotic vs. placebo at week 12.
      Secondary outcome measures included change in the IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL)
      score and change in the IBS-SSS symptom component scores. RESULTS: A total of 186
      patients were randomised and 152 patients completed the study. The mean change in
      IBS-SSS was -63.3 probiotic vs. -28.3 placebo. The mean difference in the IBS-SSS
      was statistically significant [-35.0 (95% CI; -62.03, -7.87); P = 0.01]. There
      was no significant improvement in the IBS-QOL. No serious adverse events were
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-strain probiotic was associated with a
      statistically significant improvement in overall symptom severity in patients
      with IBS, and was well tolerated. These results suggest this probiotic confers
      benefit in IBS and deserves further investigation (ISRCTN identifier: 77512412).

AB  - Probiotics are microorganisms exerting beneficial effects on the host. They can
      be ingested through foods or supplements and their inclusion in these products is
      regulated in Canada by the Health Canada Health Products and Food Branch. The aim
      of this article is to summarize current evidence from randomized controlled
      trials and guidelines from Health Canada, the World Health Organization, and
      internationally recognized expert committees in the hope that it will help
      practitioners and professionals recommending probiotics to healthy and diseased
      patients, with a focus on the Canadian setting. From a general perspective,
      probiotics can be recommended for prevention of diseases that are associated to
      altered intestinal ecology. Specifically, they can be recommended for prevention 
      of upper respiratory tract infections and pouchitis, for prevention and
      management of necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial vaginosis and antibiotic
      associated diarrhea, including Clostridium difficile infection, and for treatment
      of atopic eczema in cow's milk allergy and of infectious diarrhea. Additional
      substantiated probiotic benefits include prevention of hypercholesterolemia,
      management of constipation, reduction of recurrent urinary tract infections,
      improvement of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and reduction of antibiotics
      side effects in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Because probiotics are generally
      recognized as safe and can be removed with antimicrobial agents, their use should
      be considered in patients of all ages.

TI  - A role for the gut microbiota in IBS.
PG  - 497-505
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2014.40 [doi]
AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion of knowledge regarding the vast
      microbial community that resides within our intestine-the gut microbiota. The
      topic has generated great expectations in terms of gaining a better understanding
      of disorders ranging from IBD to metabolic disorders and obesity. IBS is a
      condition for which investigators have long been in search of plausible
      underlying pathogeneses and it is inevitable that altered composition or function
      of the gut microbiota will be considered as a potential aetiological factor in at
      least a subset of patients with IBS. This Review describes the evidence
      implicating the gut microbiota in not only the expression of the intestinal
      manifestations of IBS, but also the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 
      80% of patients with IBS. The evidence described herein ranges from
      proof-of-concept studies in animals to observational studies and clinical trials 
      in humans. The gut microbiota is subject to influences from a diverse range of
      factors including diet, antibiotic usage, infection and stress. These factors
      have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS and further prompt 
      consideration of a role for the gut microbiota in IBS.

TI  - Effects in the use of a genetically engineered strain of Lactococcus lactis
      delivering in situ IL-10 as a therapy to treat low-grade colon inflammation.
PG  - 1611-21
LID - 10.4161/hv.28549 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now
      evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients,
      including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as 
      the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus
      lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many
      pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In
      this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in
      IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of
      DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a
      recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible
      Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin 
      levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as
      readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing
      evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight
      junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of
      recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L.
      lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects 
      in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters.
      Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a
      "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE
      system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at
      mucosal surfaces.

TI  - Cytokine and clinical response to Saccharomyces boulardii therapy in
      diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized trial.
PG  - 630-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000094 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects of the
      probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii on proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines in patients with diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).
      The other objectives were to document any clinical improvement as judged by
      symptoms, quality of life, and histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a
      randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in which S. boulardii, 750
      mg/day, or placebo was administered for 6 weeks in IBS-D patients, in addition to
      ispaghula husk standard treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients received S.
      boulardii and 35 patients received the placebo. As compared with placebo, the S. 
      boulardii group showed a significant decrease in blood and tissue levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (P<0.001) and an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels, as well as an
      increase in the tissue IL-10/IL-12 ratio (P<0.001). No significant change in the 
      blood and tissue levels of cytokines was found in the placebo group.
      Bowel-related IBS-D symptoms reported in the patients' daily diary improved in
      both groups. However, overall improvement in the quality of life was more marked 
      in the S. boulardii group. Although baseline histological findings were mild, an 
      improvement was observed in the probiotic group in the lymphocyte and neutrophil 
      infiltrates (P=0.017 and 0.018), epithelial mitosis (P=0.003), and
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.024). No serious adverse events were found in
      either group. CONCLUSION: S. boulardii with ispaghula husk was superior to
      placebo with ispaghula husk in improving the cytokine profile, histology, and
      quality of life of patients with IBS-D. These preliminary results need to be
      confirmed in a well-powered trial.

LID - 10.3928/00904481-20140325-08 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in children and adults. The
      pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IBS remains incompletely understood. The
      biopsychosocial model, which conceptualizes chronic pain as a dysregulation of
      the gut-brain-homeostasis with peripheral and central factors mutually
      influencing each other, is the most accepted framework to explain IBS. Twin and
      family aggregation studies suggest a genetic component that does not exclusively 
      explain the higher prevalence of IBS in certain families. Social learning
      (environmental factors) and maladaptive coping predispose children to develop IBS
      with greater disability and more frequent medical consultations. Early-life
      events constitute an additional risk factor for the development of IBS and other 
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Children with a history of cow's
      milk protein hypersensitivity or abdominal surgeries have a higher prevalence of 
      IBS and other FGIDs years later. IBS frequently follows an episode of acute
      gastrointestinal inflammation (infectious or non-infectious). This article
      discusses the importance, known pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical approach,
      and evidence-based therapeutic options for the management of IBS in children and 
      adolescents.

PG  - 1405-15

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the potential role of probiotics and antimicrobials for
      management of functional bowel disorders (FBDs), with a focus on irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relevant adult data were identified 
      via PubMed, with additional references obtained by reviewing bibliographies from 
      selected articles. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment involves colonizing the
      intestines with beneficial microorganisms, whereas antimicrobial therapy involves
      modulation of the bacterial load and/or host response. A meta-analysis reported
      that all probiotic species evaluated improved flatulence compared with placebo;
      some, but not all, species improved abdominal pain and abdominal
      bloating/distension; and no species evaluated improved stool frequency or
      consistency, straining during stool evacuation, sense of incomplete evacuation,
      or fecal urgency. Two additional meta-analyses reported that probiotics
      significantly improved overall IBS symptoms. Individual studies have demonstrated
      potential benefits of probiotics for functional constipation symptoms. The
      nonsystemic antimicrobials neomycin and rifaximin have been evaluated in patients
      with IBS and other FBDs. Neomycin may improve global IBS symptoms and provide
      bowel normalization versus placebo, but the risk of ototoxicity and the
      development of clinically relevant bacterial resistance may limit its use for
      recurrent symptoms. In phase 3 randomized studies, rifaximin-treated patients
      were significantly more likely than placebo-treated patients to achieve adequate 
      relief of global IBS symptoms and abdominal bloating. Although preliminary data
      suggest that development of clinically relevant bacterial resistance is unlikely 
      with rifaximin, prospective data are needed, and a phase 3 study is ongoing.
      Limitations of evidence for probiotics include small populations analyzed and
      lack of clarity in optimal dosing regimen; antimicrobial evidence would benefit
      from better understanding of the effects of repeated treatment in patients with
      IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics and nonsystemic antibiotics have a place in IBS
      management. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal regimens and
      identify subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from these therapies.

      syndrome and its potential influence on therapeutic targets.
PG  - 1033-42
LID - 10.1111/apt.12728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal
      disease with a substantial social and economic burden. Treatment options remain
      limited and research on the aetiology and pathophysiology of this multifactorial 
      disease is ongoing. AIM: To discuss the potential role of gut microbiota in the
      pathophysiology of IBS and to identify possible interactions with
      pathophysiologic targets in IBS. METHODS: Articles were identified via a PubMed
      database search ['irritable bowel syndrome' AND (anti-bacterial OR antibiotic OR 
      flora OR microbiota OR microflora OR probiotic)]. English-language articles were 
      screened for relevance. Full review of publications for the relevant studies was 
      conducted, including additional publications that were identified from individual
      article reference lists. RESULTS: The role of gut microbiota in IBS is supported 
      by varying lines of evidence from animal and human studies. For example,
      post-infectious IBS in humans is well documented. In addition, certain probiotics
      and nonsystemic antibiotics appear to be efficacious in the treatment of IBS.
      Mechanisms involved in improving IBS symptoms likely go beyond mere changes in
      the composition of the gut microbiota, and accumulating animal data support the
      interplay of microbiota with other IBS targets, such as the gut-brain axis,
      visceral hypersensitivity, mucosal inflammation and motility. CONCLUSION: The
      role of the gut microbiota is still being elucidated; however, it appears to be
      one of several important factors that contributes to the aetiology and
      pathophysiology of the irritable bowel syndrome.

PG  - 135-54

AB  - The microbiome located in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) comprises the
      largest community (diverse and dense) of bacteria, and in conjunction with a
      conducive internal milieu, promotes the development of regulated pro- and
      anti-inflammatory signals within the GIT that promotes immunological and
      metabolic tolerance. In addition, host-microbial interactions govern GIT
      inflammation and provide cues for upholding metabolic regulation in both the host
      and microbes. Failure to regulate inflammatory responses can increase the risk of
      developing inflammatory conditions in the GIT. Here, we review clinical studies
      regarding the efficacy of probiotics/prebiotics and the role they may have in
      restoring host metabolic homeostasis by rescuing the inflammatory response. The
      clinical studies reviewed included functional constipation, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. We have demonstrated that there was an overall reduction in risk
      when probiotics were administered over placebo in the majority of GIT
      inflammatory conditions. The effect size of a cumulative reduction in relative
      risk for the GIT conditions/diseases investigated was 0.65 (0.61-0.70) (z =
      13.3); p < 0.0001 that is an average reduction in risk of 35 % in favour of
      probiotics. We also progress a hypothesis that the GIT comprises numerous
      micro-axes (e.g. mucus secretion, Th1/Th2 balance) that are in operational
      homeostasis; hence probiotics and prebiotics may have a significant
      pharmacobiotic regulatory role in maintaining host GIT homeostasis in disease
      states partially through reactive oxygen species signalling.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the society. Among the putative
      pathogeneses, gut dysmotility results in pain and disturbed defecation. The
      latter is probably caused by the effect of abnormal gut water secretion. The
      interaction between abnormal gas accumulation, abdominal pain and bloating
      remains controversial. Visceral hypersensitivity and its modification along with 
      the central transmission are the characteristics of IBS patients. The
      identification of biologic markers based on genetic polymorphisms is
      undetermined. Imbalanced gut microbiota may alter epithelial permeability to
      activate nociceptive sensory pathways which in turn lead to IBS. Certain food
      constituents may exacerbate bowel symptoms. The impact of adult and childhood
      abuses on IBS is underestimated. Using the concept of biopsychosocial dysfunction
      can integrate multidimensional pathogeneses. Antispasmodics plus stool
      consistency modifiers to treat the major symptoms and defecation are the
      first-line drug treatment. New drugs targeting receptors governing bowel
      motility, sensation and secretion can be considered, but clinicians must be aware
      of their potential serious side effects. Psychiatric drugs and modalities may be 
      the final options for treating intractable subjects. Probiotics of multi-species 
      preparations are safe and worth to be considered for the treatment. Antibiotics
      are promising but their long-term safety and effectiveness are unknown. Diet
      therapy including exclusion of certain food constituents is an economic measure. 
      Using relatively safe complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) may be
      optional to those patients who failed classical treatment. In conclusion, IBS is 
      a heterogeneous disorder with multidimensional pathogeneses. Personalized
      medicines with multidisciplinary approaches using different classes of drugs,
      psychiatric measures, probiotics and antibiotics, dietary therapy, and finally
      CAMs, can be considered.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterized by abdominal
      pain or discomfort, bloating, and altered stool form and passage. Small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition in which there is
      overgrowth of bacteria in small bowel in excess of 10(5) colony forming units per
      milliliter on culture of the upper gut aspirate. Frequency of SIBO varied from
      4%-78% among patients with IBS and from 1%-40% among controls. Higher frequency
      in some studies might be due to fallacious criteria [post-lactulose
      breath-hydrogen rise 20 PPM above basal within 90 min (early-peak)]. Glucose
      hydrogen breath test (GHBT) has a low sensitivity to diagnose SIBO. Hence,
      studies based on GHBT might have under-estimated frequency of SIBO. Therefore, it
      is important to analyze these studies carefully to evaluate whether the reported 
      association between IBS and SIBO is over or under-projected. This review
      evaluates studies on association between SIBO and IBS, discordance between
      different studies, their strength and weakness including methodological issues
      and evidence on therapeutic manipulation of gut flora on symptoms of IBS.

TI  - Unraveling the ties between irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal microbiota.
PG  - 2470-81
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i10.2470 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal 
      disorder. It is a multifactorial disorder. Intestinal microbiota may cause the
      pathogenesis of IBS by contributing to abnormal gastrointestinal motility,
      low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain
      axis, and so on. Previous attempts to identify the intestinal microbiota
      composition in IBS patients have yielded inconsistent and occasionally
      contradictory results. This inconsistency may be due to the differences in the
      molecular techniques employed, the sample collection and handling methods, use of
      single samples that are not linked to fluctuating symptoms, or other factors such
      as patients' diets and phenotypic characterizations. Despite these difficulties, 
      previous studies found that the intestinal microbiota in some IBS patients was
      completely different from that in healthy controls, and there does appear to be a
      consistent theme of Firmicutes enrichment and reduced abundance of Bacteroides.
      Based on the differences in intestinal microbiota composition, many studies have 
      addressed the roles of microbiota-targeted treatments, such as antibiotics and
      probiotics, in alleviating certain symptoms of IBS. This review summarizes the
      current knowledge of the associations between intestinal microbiota and IBS as
      well as the possible modes of action of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis
      of IBS. Improving the current level of understanding of host-microbiota
      interactions in IBS is important not only for determining the role of intestinal 
      microbiota in IBS pathogenesis but also for therapeutic modulation of the
      microbiota.

TI  - The use of complementary and alternative therapies and of psychotherapy by
      Romanian patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 148-51
AB  - UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an invalidating condition, lacking 
      a perfect therapy. Therefore, many patients use also complementary and
      alternative therapies (CAT) or psychotherapy (PT). There are no data on the use
      of CAT and PT in IBS in our area. We looked for this until uncovered aspect of
      IBS management in Romania. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 250 consecutive patients with
      IBS (142 F/108M, aged 49 +/- 12 years) referred to a tertiary gastroenterological
      center were questioned about the use of CAT and PT using a structured specially
      developed questionnaire. All of the patients accepted to answer the questionnaire
      after careful instruction. RESULTS: 162 out of 250 pts (64%) admitted to have
      used one or more CAT, usually together with pharmacological prescriptions. Among 
      CAT users, 32 patients (20%) used only CAT and not allopathic drugs. CAT used
      were: homeopathy 13%, herbal therapy 72%, acupuncture 3%, bioenergetic resonance 
      11%, others 13%. Probiotics were used by 30%. Users were mainly females of lower 
      educational levels. Psychotherapy was used by 30 pts (12%). 25 (10%) used CBT, 15
      (6%) used relaxation therapy. CONCLUSION: The majority of IBS pts. in our area
      use CAT usually in association with allopathic therapy. The most frequently used 
      are herbal prescriptions followed by probiotics. PT less frequently used in our
      IBS patients.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial on the effect of a multispecies probiotic on
      visceroperception in hypersensitive IBS patients.
PG  - 705-14
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by heterogeneous
      pathophysiology and low response to treatment. Up to 60% of IBS patients suffers 
      from visceral hypersensitivity, which is associated with symptom severity and
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Recently, positive effects of
      probiotics in IBS have been reported, but overall the response was modest. We
      performed a study in IBS patients, characterized by visceral hypersensitivity
      measured with the rectal barostat, aiming to assess the effect of 6 weeks of
      multispecies probiotic mix on visceral pain perception. METHODS: We conducted a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in forty Rome III IBS patients
      with visceral hypersensitivity. Prior to intake, patients kept a 2-week symptom
      diary and underwent a rectal barostat measurement. When hypersensitivity was
      confirmed, participation was allowed and patients received a multispecies
      probiotic with in vitro proven potential beneficial effects on mechanisms
      contributing to visceral hypersensitivity (six different probiotic strains; 10(9)
      cfu/g), or a placebo product of one sachet (5 g) per day for 6 weeks. At the end 
      of the intervention period, visceroperception and symptoms were reassessed. KEY
      RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the trial. The percentage of patients
      with visceral hypersensitivity decreased significantly in the probiotic and
      placebo group (76.5% and 71.4%, respectively; N.S. between groups). Improvement
      in pain scores and mean symptom score did not differ between the probiotic and
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In this placebo-controlled trial in IBS 
      patients with visceral hypersensitivity, no significant effect of a multispecies 
      probiotic on viscerperception was observed. The study has been registered in the 
      US National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00702026).

      option in irritable bowel syndrome.

LID - 10.3920/BM2013.0033 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal microbiota forms a complex ecosystem that is in close contact with
      its host and has an important impact on health. An increasing number of disorders
      are associated with disturbances in this ecosystem. Also patients suffering from 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) show an altered composition of their gut
      microbiota. IBS is a multifactorial chronic disorder characterised by various
      abdominal complaints and a worldwide prevalence of 10-20%. Even though its
      aetiology and pathophysiology are complex and not well understood, it is widely
      accepted that aberrations along the microbe-gut-brain axis are involved. In this 
      review, it will be discussed how exogenous factors, e.g. antibiotics, can cause
      disbalance in the intestinal microbiota and thereby contribute to the development
      of IBS. In addition, several new IBS treatment options that aim at
      re-establishing a healthy, beneficial ecosystem will be described. These include 
      antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and faecal transplantation.

AB  - Alterations in the bidirectional interactions between the intestine and the
      nervous system have important roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). A body of largely preclinical evidence suggests that the gut
      microbiota can modulate these interactions. A small and poorly defined role for
      dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through
      characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported
      improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics,
      probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are 
      caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or 
      primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered
      interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the
      potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of
      patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal
      microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate
      intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.

PG  - 321-34
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a highly prevalent condition responsible for almost
      one third of visits to the gastroenterologist and huge expenses for diagnosis,
      treatment and loss of working days. A unique pathophysiologic mechanism has not
      been elucidated yet and several possibilities have been proposed such as
      senso-perception and motor disturbances, the effect of stress and anxiety,
      serotonin receptor failures, activation of abnormal brain areas and pain
      modulation differences, among others. The absence of a biological marker has led 
      the investigators to consider this syndrome as an exclusion diagnostic condition,
      once the organic diseases have been discarded The changes in gut microbiota have 
      recently raised great interest among gastroenterologists. The study of the small 
      intestinal bowel overgrowth syndrome, the effect of antibiotics upon the flora,
      the recognition of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and the action of
      probiotics, together with the effect of malabsortion of diet carbohydrates have
      brought some new light in our knowledge. The present update will focus on the
      published evidence about the subject, bearing in mind that the mechanisms
      elicited here are only suitable for a subgroup of patients.

AB  - There is compelling rationale for manipulating the microbiota to treat
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Although studies of animal models of
      intestinal inflammation produced promising results, trials in humans have been
      disappointing. In contrast to IBD, the role of the microbiota in the development 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only recently has been considered, but early
      stage results have been encouraging. As pharmaceutical companies develop fewer
      truly novel agents for treatment of these disorders, consumers seek safer,
      long-term strategies to deal with chronic symptoms. We assess the rationale for
      modulating the microbiota for treatment of IBD and IBS, and discuss whether
      current concepts are simplistic and overstated or simply under-researched. Are
      claims exaggerated and expectations unrealistic? Difficulties with microbiota
      terminology and technologies, as well as differences among patients and the
      heterogeneity of these diseases, pose additional challenges in developing
      microbiota-based therapies for IBD and IBS.

AB  - CONTEXT: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease
      characterized by abdominal pain and altered intestinal habits. The
      pathophysiology of IBS remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that
      some IBS patients, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), display
      persistent signs of minor mucosal inflammation and a modified intestinal
      microflora. The mesalazine has known intestinal anti-inflammatory properties.
      Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic used for a long time in treatment of
      diarrhea, including infectious diarrhea. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of
      mesalazine alone, combined therapy of mesalazine with liophylised Saccharomyces
      boulardii or alone on symptoms of IBS-D patients. METHODS: Based on Rome III
      criteria, 53 IBS-D patients (18 year or more) were included. To exclude organic
      diseases all patients underwent colonoscopy, stool culture, serum anti-endomisium
      antibody, lactose tolerance test and ova and parasite exam. Patients were divided
      in three groups: mesalazine group (MG) - 20 patients received mesalazine 800 mg
      t.i.d. for 30 days; mesalazine and Saccharomyces boulardii group (MSbG) - 21
      patients received mesalazine 800 mg t.i.d. and Saccharomyces boulardii 200 mg
      t.i.d. for 30 days and; Saccharomyces boulardii group (SbG) - 12 patients
      received Sb 200 mg t.i.d. for 30 days. Drugs that might have any effect on
      intestinal motility or secretion were not allowed. Symptom evaluations at
      baseline and after treatment were performed by means of a 4-point likert scale
      including: stool frequency, stool form and consistency (Bristol scale), abdominal
      pain and distension. Paired t test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there were statistically
      significant reduction of symptom score after 30 th day therapy in all three
      groups: MG (P<0.0001); MSbG (P<0.0001) and in SbG (P = 0.003). There were
      statistically significant differences in the symptom score at 30 th day therapy
      of the MG, MSbG and SbG groups (P = 0.03). There were no statistical differences 
      between MSbG and MG symptom score at 30th day therapy (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The
      use of mesalazine alone, Saccharomyces boulardii alone or combined treatment with
      mesalasine and Saccaromyces boulardii improved IBS-D symptoms. The improvement of
      the symptom score was greater with mesalazine alone or combined with Sb as
      compared with Sb treatment alone. These preliminary results suggest that
      mezalazine may be useful in treatment of IBS-d patients, and warrant further
      larger studies.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract inhabits a complex microbial ecosystem that
      plays a vital role in host health through its contributions to nutrient synthesis
      and digestion, protection from pathogens, and promoting maturation of host innate
      and adapt immune systems. The development of gut microbiota primarily occurs
      during infancy and is influenced by multiple factors, including prenatal
      exposure; gestational age; mode of delivery; feeding type; pre-, pro-, and
      antibiotic use; and host genetics. In genetically susceptible individuals,
      changes in the gut microbiota induced by environmental factors may contribute to 
      the development of immune-related disorders in childhood, including atopic
      diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Pre- and probiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment 
      of some immune-related diseases by modulating gut microbiota and regulating host 
      mucosal immune function. The review will discuss recent findings on the
      environmental factors that influence development of gut microbiota during infancy
      and its potential impact on some immune-related diseases in childhood. The use of
      pre- and probiotics for prevention and intervention of several important diseases
      in early life will also be reviewed.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic disorder of complex genesis. Infections,
      indiscriminate use of antibiotics and bowel cleansing may affect the composition 
      of the microbiota. Knowledge of host-microbiota interaction is important to
      deepen their pathogenesis and allow therapeutic modulation of the microbiota. The
      interaction between the microbiota, the immune system and the enteric nervous
      system is not yet well understood, but could be important in the pathophysiology 
      of the disorder. New therapeutic possibilities found with prebiotics, probiotics,
      new painkillers and antibiotics such as rifaximin. The modification of the fecal 
      microbiota by transplantation may become a future therapeutic option.

      syndrome from the standpoint of evidence based medicine indicates that most of
      them (spasmolytics, probiotics, loperamide, aperients) show but low
      effectiveness. The use of more efficacious preparations (alosterone, cisapride,

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to update the reader on current developments
      in our understanding of how the gut microbiota impact on inflammatory bowel
      disease and the irritable bowel syndrome. It will also consider current efforts
      to modulate the microbiota for therapeutic effect. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene
      polymorphisms associated with inflammatory bowel disease increasingly suggest
      that interaction with the microbiota drives pathogenesis. This may be through
      modulation of the immune response, mucosal permeability or the products of
      microbial metabolism. Similar findings in irritable bowel syndrome have
      reinforced the role of gut-specific factors in this 'functional' disorder.
      Metagenomic analysis has identified alterations in pathways and interactions with
      the ecosystem of the microbiome that may not be recognized by taxonomic
      description alone, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism. Treatments targeted
      at the microbial stimulus with antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics have all
      progressed in the past year. Studies on the long-term effects of treatment on the
      microbiome suggest that dietary intervention may be needed for prolonged
      efficacy. SUMMARY: The microbiome represents 'the other genome', and to
      appreciate its role in health and disease will be as challenging as with our own 
      genome. Intestinal diseases occur at the front line of our interaction with the
      microbiome and their future treatment will be shaped as we unravel our
      relationship with it.

AB  - The human gut is a huge complex ecosystem where microbiota, nutrients, and host
      cells interact extensively, a process crucial for the gut homeostasis and host
      development with a real partnership. The various bacterial communities that make 
      up the gut microbiota have many functions including metabolic, barrier effect,
      and trophic functions. Hence, any dysbiosis could have negative consequences in
      terms of health and many diseases have been associated to impairment of the gut
      microbiota. These close relationships between gut microbiota, health, and
      disease, have led to great interest in using probiotics (i.e. live
      micro-organisms), or prebiotics (i.e. non-digestible substrates) to positively
      modulate the gut microbiota to prevent or treat some diseases. This review
      focuses on probiotics, their mechanisms of action, safety, and major health
      benefits. Health benefits remain to be proven in some indications, and further
      studies on the best strain(s), dose, and algorithm of administration to be used
      are needed. Nevertheless, probiotic administration seems to have a great
      potential in terms of health that justifies more research.

TI  - The therapeutic effect of probiotic bacteria on gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 759-66
AB  - The cause of many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome,
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease: inflammatory and necrotizing enterocolitis or
      diarrhea: infectious, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea caused by antibiotic
      treatment is an imbalance of intestinal microflora. Probiotics are live
      microorganisms, which administered in sufficient quantities, have beneficial
      health effects. The phenomenon of eating probiotic products started 100 years
      ago, when the first reports showed beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria on
      human health. Since then, probiotic preparations have become an essential element
      in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Currently, probiotics are of
      the utmost importance in supporting the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases
      and autoimmune disorders. Probiotic microorganisms are primarily lactic
      acid-producing bacteria of the general Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium. Many
      studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of probiotics, particularly in the 
      treatment of acute diarrhea. This applies in particular to diarrhea of viral
      etiology, especially in infants and young children.

      the quantity and quality of the current evidence regarding the effect of
      different probiotic strains in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGID) in children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are more
      effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related
      FGID, especially with respect to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. To date,
      however, probiotics have not proved effective for children with functional
      constipation.

TI  - The human microbiome and probiotics: implications for pediatrics.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1159/000354899 [doi]
AB  - Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human
      microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely
      contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial
      microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important
      considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future.
      Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing
      rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of
      the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear
      capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics
      may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome
      function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human
      health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the
      context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states
      include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis,
      acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it
      is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the 
      impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced
      understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate
      selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder,
      characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain with constipation, diarrhea 
      and/or an alternation of the two, and often bloating. Complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) consists of a group of medical treatments that are not
      commonly considered to be a part of traditional medicine. CAM is commonly used
      for difficult-to-treat chronic medical conditions. Many patients choose CAM
      because there are only a limited number of treatments available for IBS or
      because they would like to have a 'natural therapy'. Mind-body therapies for IBS 
      have proven efficacy, but have not been well accepted by patients or
      practitioners for treatment. This article reviews the use of CAM and mind-body
      therapies in IBS, with a focus on probiotics, acupuncture, herbal medicines and
      psychological therapies.

TI  - Common gastrointestinal symptoms: irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 16-23
AB  - The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be considered when
      patients have had abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and change in bowel habits
      for 6 months. Patients may experience variation between periods of constipation
      and diarrhea. When evaluating patients with IBS, physicians should be alert for
      red flag symptoms, such as rectal bleeding, anemia, nighttime pain, and weight
      loss. Physicians also should consider other medical conditions that manifest
      similarly to IBS. Clinicians who are confident in diagnosing IBS based on
      symptoms typically do not obtain many tests unless the patient has red flag
      symptoms. Various etiologic mechanisms have been proposed for IBS, including
      abnormal bowel motility, inflammation, altered mucosal permeability, genetic
      predisposition, and visceral hypersensitivity. Lack of certainty about the
      etiology makes it difficult to develop effective management approaches; thus,
      management is directed toward symptom relief. Dietary changes, such as avoiding
      fermentable carbohydrates, may benefit some patients, especially those with
      bloating. Constipation-dominant IBS can be managed with antispasmodics,
      lubiprostone, or linaclotide, whereas diarrhea-dominant IBS can be managed with
      loperamide or alosetron, though the latter drug can cause ischemic colitis. For
      long-term therapy, tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors have good efficacy. Peppermint oil and probiotics also may provide
      benefit.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common gastrointestinal problems. It is
      characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in 
      stool frequency and/or consistency. The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be
      multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in 
      gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut 
      epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain
      psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory.
      There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal
      microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in
      certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition.
      Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract.
      Recently, many studies have suggested that probiotics are effective in the
      treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex. The
      purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and mechanisms for the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of IBS.

AB  - At best, currently available therapies provide symptomatic relief from functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). No existing therapy, however, can influence the
      natural course of any of these disorders, prompting interest in new and safe
      treatment options. This paper summarizes the clinical evidence from randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses of the effectiveness of
      probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary fiber in the treatment of FGD in the
      pediatric population. While it is too soon to recommend the routine use of any
      probiotics for treating FGD, some of these therapeutic options can provide a
      health benefit to patients, and therefore can be discussed with patients and/or
      caregivers. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has consistently improved symptoms of
      infantile colic. The use of Lactobacillus GG moderately increased treatment
      success in children with abdominal pain-related FGD, particularly among children 
      with irritable bowel syndrome. Also, data from one trial suggest that VSL#3 seems
      to be effective in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life of
      children affected by irritable bowel syndrome. L. reuteri DSM 17938 may help
      infants with constipation. Limited evidence suggests that administration of a
      fiber supplement is more effective than placebo for the treatment of childhood
      constipation.

TI  - Systematic review: probiotics in the management of lower gastrointestinal
      symptoms in clinical practice -- an evidence-based international guide.
PG  - 864-86
LID - 10.1111/apt.12460 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota play an important role in
      gastrointestinal problems. AIM: To give clinicians a practical reference guide on
      the role of specified probiotics in managing particular lower gastrointestinal
      symptoms/problems by means of a systematic review-based consensus. METHODS:
      Systematic literature searching identified randomised, placebo-controlled trials 
      in adults; evidence for each symptom/problem was graded and statements developed 
      (consensus process; 10-member panel). As results cannot be generalised between
      different probiotics, individual probiotics were identified for each statement.
      RESULTS: Thirty seven studies were included; mostly on irritable bowel syndrome
      [IBS; 19 studies; treatment responder rates: 18-80% (specific probiotics), 5-50% 
      (placebo)] or antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD; 10 studies). Statements with 
      100% agreement and 'high' evidence levels indicated that: (i) specific probiotics
      help reduce overall symptom burden and abdominal pain in some IBS patients; (ii) 
      in patients receiving antibiotics/Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy,
      specified probiotics are helpful as adjuvants to prevent/reduce the
      duration/intensity of AAD; (iii) probiotics have favourable safety in patients in
      primary care. Items with 70-100% agreement and 'moderate' evidence were: (i)
      specific probiotics help relieve overall symptom burden in some patients with
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS, and reduce bloating/distension and improve bowel
      movement frequency/consistency in some IBS patients and (ii) with some
      probiotics, improved symptoms have led to improvement in quality of life.
      CONCLUSIONS: Specified probiotics can provide benefit in IBS and
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea; relatively few studies in other indications
      suggested benefits warranting further research. This study provides practical
      guidance on which probiotic to select for a specific problem.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a natural reservoir of microbiota. The gut is
      germ-free at birth, but rapidly becomes host to various bacteria establishing a
      progressively mutual relationship. The composition of gut microbiota is
      individual-specific and depends on the genotype of the host and environmental
      factors. Novel techniques have been used to characterize gastrointestinal
      microbiota, including genomic approaches. The bacterial profile shows that
      dominant and minor phyla are present in the gastrointestinal tract. From the
      proximal to the distal segments of the gut the bacterial density gradually
      increases, reaching an estimated 10(11) to 10(12) bacteria per gram of colonic
      content. Dynamic interactions between gut and microbiota play a physiological
      role in metabolic, protective and structural functions, while dysbiosis
      contributes to several diseases. Microbiota appear to play a role in IBS, where
      qualitative and quantitative changes of bacteriaoccur in IBS subtypes. Initial
      therapeutic approaches in IBS have focused on microbiota. The relationship
      between perturbations of the microbiota, mucosal inflammation and IBS remains to 
      be further investigated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Meta-analyses have indicated effect of probiotics on irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). However, few long-term trials have been conducted and uncertainty
      remains as to effectiveness and long-term effect in a primary care setting. We
      aimed to investigate the effect of probiotics compared with placebo in the
      management of IBS in primary care during a 6-month treatment period and with a
      6-month follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We randomized IBS patients fulfilling
      Rome III criteria to receive two capsules twice daily either containing placebo
      or a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19,
      Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium Bb12 in an amount of 1.3 x
      10(10) CFU per capsule. Primary endpoint was proportion of responders defined as 
      patients reporting adequate relief (AR) at least 50% of the time in the 6-month
      treatment period. Secondary outcomes were proportions of patients reporting AR at
      different time points, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related
      quality of life (HrQOL) from baseline to 6 and 12 months. RESULTS. A total of 131
      patients were included in this study. The proportion of responders in the
      treatment period was 52% (35/67) in the probiotic group versus 41% (26/64) in the
      placebo group, p = 0.18. Overall we found no difference between the groups in
      change in gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment. Patients improved in HrQOL, 
      but with no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION. 
      During a 6-month treatment period, we were not able to detect a positive effect
      of probiotic when compared with placebo.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, diet and health.
PG  - 387-402
LID - 10.1017/S0007114513002560 [doi]
AB  - The human intestine is colonised by 10(1)(3) to 10(1)(4) micro-organisms, the
      vast majority of which belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Although
      highly stable over time, the composition and activities of the microbiota may be 
      influenced by a number of factors including age, diet and antibiotic treatment.
      Although perturbations in the composition or functions of the microbiota are
      linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome and obesity), it is unclear at this point whether these 
      changes are a symptom of the disease or a contributing factor. A better knowledge
      of the mechanisms through which changes in microbiota composition (dysbiosis)
      promote disease states is needed to improve our understanding of the causal
      relationship between the gut microbiota and disease. While evidence of the
      preventive and therapeutic effects of probiotic strains on diarrhoeal illness and
      other intestinal conditions is promising, the exact mechanisms of the beneficial 
      effects are not fully understood. Recent studies have raised the question of
      whether non-viable probiotic strains can confer health benefits on the host by
      influencing the immune system. As the potential health effect of these non-viable
      bacteria depends on whether the mechanism of this effect is dependent on
      viability, future research needs to consider each probiotic strain on a
      case-by-case basis. The present review provides a comprehensive, updated overview
      of the human gut microbiota, the factors influencing its composition and the role
      of probiotics as a therapeutic modality in the treatment and prevention of
      diseases and/or restoration of human health.

TI  - A pilot study on the effect of a symbiotic mixture in irritable bowel syndrome:
      an open-label, partially controlled, 6-month extension of a previously published 
      trial.
PG  - 345-53
LID - 10.1007/s10151-013-1055-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the efficacy of probiotics has received considerable
      attention in the treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this regard, a 
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul((R))) has shown beneficial effects. The aim of this
      study was to extend the previously published 4-week randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study of this symbiotic mixture. METHODS: This is an
      open-label prospective, partially controlled, 6-month extension period pilot
      study in which patients continued to receive the symbiotic mixture (Group 1) or
      were switched from placebo to symbiotic mixture (Group 2) using cyclic
      administration (last 2 weeks/month). The primary endpoints were the overall
      satisfactory relief of bloating and flatulence (assessed as proportions of
      responders). The secondary endpoints were evaluation of the symptom severity
      scores (bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency) and bowel function scores
      (frequency, consistency and incomplete evacuation). RESULTS: Twenty-six IBS
      patients completed the 6-month extension period (13 patients in Group 1 and 13
      patients in Group 2). In the per-protocol analysis, the proportions of responders
      across time were not significantly different in the groups but in Group 2, there 
      was an increased percentage of responders for flatulence (p = 0.07). In addition,
      the score of flatulence was reduced significantly during the 6-month treatment
      period in Group 2 (p < 0.05), while no other significant differences were
      detected. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with this symbiotic mixture was associated with 
      persistence of relief from flatulence or new reduction in flatulence in the
      present 6-month long extension study. These results need to be more
      comprehensively assessed in large, long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled
      studies.

TI  - Melancholic microbes: a link between gut microbiota and depression?
PG  - 713-9
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12198 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing awareness of the potential for microbiota to influence
      gut-brain communication in health and disease. A variety of strategies have been 
      used to study the impact of the microbiota on brain function and these include
      antibiotic use, probiotic treatments, fecal microbiota transplantation,
      gastrointestinal infection studies, and germ-free studies. All of these
      approaches provide evidence to support the view that the microbiota can influence
      brain chemistry and consequently behavior. Efforts are now turning to investigate
      the role of microbiota in animal models of psychopathology. Animal models of
      depression are thus essential in studying the complex interplay between the
      microbiota and brain. Recent studies published in this Journal and elsewhere
      demonstrate that there is a distinct perturbation of the composition of gut
      microbiota in animal models of depression and chronic stress. This has direct
      implications for the development of psychobiotic-based therapeutic strategies for
      psychiatric disorders. Moreover, given that affective co-morbidities, such as
      major depression and anxiety states, are common in patients presenting with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it may have implications for functional bowel
      disorders also. Further studies require appropriately phenotyped patients with
      depression and/or IBS using a judicious use of techniques including functional
      imaging and in depth microbial pyrosequencing.

PG  - 52-9
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The efficacy of treatment with multispecies probiotics on
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the alterations of gut microbiota in 
      patients who have taken probiotics were investigated. METHODS: This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 IBS patients (probiotics: 25, 
      placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Patients were randomly
      assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of
      Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L.
      rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive 
      a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was the
      proportion of participants whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week
      4. Secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4
      weeks. Fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo:
      17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The
      proportion of patients whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4
      was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0%
      (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (P < 0.05). Secondary end-points such as improvement 
      in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but
      not in the placebo group. Fecal analysis revealed that B. lactis, L. rhamnosus,
      and S. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4
      weeks and that B. lactis had increased in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Multispecies probiotics are effective in IBS patients and induce the alterations 
      in the composition of intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract. This highly prevalent condition is best diagnosed by
      assessing the constellation of symptoms with which patients present to their
      physicians. Because some critics have previously questioned whether irritable
      bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders truly exist
      because they do not have defining structural features, the Rome Foundation
      fostered the use of symptom-based criteria for universal use. In most cases
      treatment is reduced to symptomatic therapy because a lot of unknown in
      pathogenesis by irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome leads to
      decrease of quality of life of the patients and could be one of the reasons of
      patients' disability. Food is believed by patients promotes symptoms and the diet
      or avoiding specific food can reduce symptoms. Possible role of different food
      and microbiota in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome, as well as the
      data from randomized, controlled clinical trials dedicated to the effects of diet
      in irritable bowel syndrome are summarized and discussed in this review. The
      efficacy of the diet, enriched by fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, peppermint oil, 
      curcumin and vitamin B6 in irritable bowel syndrome patients was shown in
      numerous studies. In some studies restriction in consumption of fermented
      carbohydrates, coffee and alcohol, as well as diet with elimination IgG-sensed
      food was also shown to be effective in irritable bowel syndrome. Food
      intolerances, defined as non-toxic non-immune adverse reactions to food, include 
      reactions to bioactive chemicals in foods and metabolic reactions to poorly
      absorbed dietary carbohydrates. New dietary approaches like polyunsaturated fatty
      acids intake correction and the low tryptophan intake are discussed.

TI  - Effect of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 1624-31
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the gut microbiota may be 
      altered. Probiotic bacteria appear to be therapeutically effective. We
      characterized the mucosa-associated microbiota, and determined the clinical and
      microbiological effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria, in patients
      with IBS. METHODS: Mucosal microbiota from rectal biopsies of IBS patients and
      controls were assessed on the V1 and V2 variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA
      gene amplified using 454 pyrosequencing. Clinical symptoms and changes in mucosal
      microbiota were assessed in IBS patients before and after 4 weeks of treatment
      with probiotic mix VSL#3. RESULTS: Ten IBS subjects (eight female; mean age 46
      years) were included. At week 4 of probiotic therapy, six patients showed symptom
      improvement on global symptom assessment compared with baseline (P = 0.031).
      Before therapy, intestinal microbiota of IBS subjects differed significantly from
      that of healthy controls, with less diversity and evenness than controls (n = 9; 
      P < 0.05), increased abundance of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.014) and Synegitestes (P =
      0.017), and reduced abundance of Actinobacteria (P = 0.004). The classes
      Flavobacteria (P = 0.028) and Epsilonproteobacteria (P = 0.017) were less
      enriched in IBS. Abundance differences were largely consistent from the phylum to
      genus level. Probiotic treatment in IBS patients was associated with a
      significant reduction of the genus Bacteroides (all taxonomy levels; P < 0.05) to
      levels similar to that of controls. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, global and
      deep molecular analysis demonstrates an altered mucosal microbiota composition in
      IBS. Probiotic leads to detectable changes in the microbiota. These effects of
      probiotic bacteria may contribute to their therapeutic benefit.

TI  - Potential of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc) milk as a probiotic
      beverage-a review.
PG  - 954-67
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2011.574803 [doi]
AB  - Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterraenea (L.) verdc) (BGN) is a legume; its origin
      have been traced back to Africa, and it is the third important legume; however,
      it is one of the neglected crops. It is highly nutritious, and has been termed a 
      complete food. Its seed consist of 49%-63.5% carbohydrate, 15%-25% protein,
      4.5%-7.4% fat, 5.2%-6.4% fiber, 3.2%-4.4% ash and 2% mineral compared to whole
      fresh cow milk 88% moisture, 4.8% carbohydrate, 3.2% proteins, 3.4% fat, 0.7%
      ash, and 0.01% cholesterol. Its chemical composition is comparable to that of soy
      bean. Furthermore, BGN has been reported to be a potential crop, owing to its
      nutritional composition, functional properties, antioxidant potential, and a
      drought resistant crop. Bambara groundnut milk (BGNM) had been rated higher in
      acceptability than milk from other legumes like soybean and cowpea. Probiotics
      have been defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate
      amount confer a health benefit on the host. These benefits have been reported to 
      be therapeutic, suppressing the growth and activity in conditions like infectious
      diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. The
      nutritional profile of BGNM is high enough to sustain the growth of probiotics.
      BGNs are normally boiled and salted, eaten as a relish or roasted, and eaten as a
      snack. Hence, BGNM can also be fermented with lactic acid bacteria to make a
      probiotic beverage that not only increase the economic value of the nutritious
      legume but also help in addressing malnutrition.

AB  - Here, we define a psychobiotic as a live organism that, when ingested in adequate
      amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric
      illness. As a class of probiotic, these bacteria are capable of producing and
      delivering neuroactive substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin, 
      which act on the brain-gut axis. Preclinical evaluation in rodents suggests that 
      certain psychobiotics possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity. Effects may 
      be mediated via the vagus nerve, spinal cord, or neuroendocrine systems. So far, 
      psychobiotics have been most extensively studied in a liaison psychiatric setting
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, where positive benefits have been
      reported for a number of organisms including Bifidobacterium infantis. Evidence
      is emerging of benefits in alleviating symptoms of depression and in chronic
      fatigue syndrome. Such benefits may be related to the anti-inflammatory actions
      of certain psychobiotics and a capacity to reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      axis activity. Results from large scale placebo-controlled studies are awaited.

TI  - A novel method for the culture and polarized stimulation of human intestinal
      mucosa explants.
PG  - e4368
LID - 10.3791/4368 [doi]
AB  - Few models currently exist to realistically simulate the complex human
      intestine's micro-environment, where a variety of interactions take place. Proper
      homeostasis directly depends on these interactions, as they shape an entire
      immunological response inducing tolerance against food antigens while at the same
      time mounting effective immune responses against pathogenic microbes accidentally
      ingested with food. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved also through various
      complex interactions between the microbiota (including food-associated beneficial
      bacterial strains) and the host, that regulate the attachment/degradation of
      mucus, the production of antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial barrier, and
      the "education" of epithelial cells' that controls the tolerogenic or immunogenic
      phenotype of unique, gut-resident lymphoid cells' populations. These interactions
      have been so far very difficult to reproduce with in vitro assays using either
      cultured cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, mouse
      models differ substantially in components of the intestinal mucosa (mucus layer
      organization, commensal bacteria community) with respect to the human gut. Thus, 
      studies of a variety of treatments to be brought in the clinics for important
      stress-related or pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer have been difficult to carry out.
      To address these issues, we developed a novel system that enables us to stimulate
      explants of human intestinal mucosa that retain their in situ conditioning by the
      host microbiota and immune response, in a polarized fashion. Polarized apical
      stimulation is of great importance for the outcome of the elicited immune
      response. It has been repeatedly shown that the same stimuli can produce
      completely different responses when they bypass the apical face of the intestinal
      epithelium, stimulating epithelial cells basolaterally or coming into direct
      contact with lamina propria components, switching the phenotype from tolerogenic 
      to immunogenic and causing unnecessary and excessive inflammation in the area. We
      achieved polarized stimulation by gluing a cave cylinder which delimited the area
      of stimulation on the apical face of the mucosa as will be described in the
      protocol. We used this model to examine, among others, differential effects of
      three different Lactobacilli strains. We show that this model system is very
      powerful to assess the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics in healthy and
      disease conditions.

TI  - [The role of small bowel microflora in the development of secondary lactase
      deficiency and the possibilities of its treatment with probiotics].
PG  - 21-6
AB  - AIM: To estimate the incidence of secondary lactase deficiency (SLD) in patients 
      with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PIBS) and the value of the small
      bowel microflora in its development and to elaborate treatment options for SLD.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with PIBS, including 
      112 (81.2%) women and 26 (18.8%) men, were examined. The patients' mean age was
      33.9 +/- 9.1 years. The duration of the disease was 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. Lactase
      deficiency (LD) was diagnosed using the color scale to test biopsy specimens from
      the duodenal retrobulbar region. The bacterial overgrowth syndrome (BOS) was
      identified by a 2-hour lactulose (20 ml) hydrogen breath test. Sixty patients
      with moderate SLD were randomized to 2 groups: 1) 41 patients received basic
      therapy (mesim forte as one tablet t.i.d., no-spa, 40 mg, t.i.d.) and combined
      probiotic bifiform (Ferrosan) containing Bifidobacterium longum 107, Enterococcus
      faecium 107 as one capsule t.i.d. for 14 days. Group 2 patients (n = 19) had
      basic therapy in combination with placebo. RESULTS: SLD was detected in 59.4% of 
      the patients with PIBS, including 43.5 and 15.9% with moderate and severe forms, 
      respectively. In all cases, SLD was accompanied by BOS in the small bowel lumen, 
      as confirmed by the results of a hydrogen breath test [101 +/- 37 ppm (a normal
      value of < 20 ppm)]. After a 14-day course of therapy with the combined probiotic
      bifiform, restoration of eubiosis in the small bowel lumen was achieved in 70.8% 
      of the patients, as shown by the lesser degree of BOS (86.9 +/- 40.9 and 17.4 +/-
      6.6 ppm before and after treatment, respectively; p < 0.01) and by normalization 
      of the lactase test (p < 0.01). In the comparative placebo group, 68.4% showed no
      clear positive changes, SLD and BOS remained. CONCLUSION: The changes in the
      small bowel intraluminal microflora, which developed after prior intestinal
      infection, played a great role in the development of SLD. Bifiform belongs to the
      currently available probiotics and may be recommended to correct SLD in patients 
      with PIBS resulting from the impaired microbiota of the small bowel and to
      prevent BOS.

PG  - 1151-60
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2013.794223 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) affects about
      one-third of patients with IBS, which is observed in about 12% of people across
      five continents. The ultimate goal in this field is to identify the underlying
      cause of symptoms in order to individualize education of the patient, and to
      provide optimal treatment of this highly prevalent condition. AREAS COVERED: This
      review addresses the pharmacological treatments for IBS-D under three categories:
      drugs for IBS-D (i.e., the 5-HT3 antagonist, alosetron); drugs approved for other
      indications that are used in IBS-D (e.g., opioid agonists; other 5-HT3
      antagonists; serotonergic psychoactive agents; bile acid binders; 5-ASA
      compounds; probiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics); as well as development of 
      drugs that are likely to impact the management of IBS-D in the future (e.g., drug
      absorbents; TPH1 inhibitors; mast cell stabilizers; centrally acting
      benzodiazepines). The final section addresses key findings: regulatory
      roadblocks; weaknesses in the current research in this field so far and
      opportunities to address unmet needs including restoration of normal intestinal
      barrier function or permeability, and suppression within the intestines of local 
      immune activation that is thought to trigger abnormal motor, sensory and
      secretory functions in IBS-D. EXPERT OPINION: While symptomatic treatment of
      diarrhea is effective, there is a need for new treatments for the IBS-D complex. 
      Greater understanding of the mechanisms in IBS-D has led to promising approaches 
      to develop more efficacious therapies.

AB  - Gut microbiota alterations are increasingly being recognized as an important
      factor in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      The onset of IBS symptoms after a bout of gastroenteritis comprises one of the
      strongest indications for the importance of gut microbiota for IBS. Moreover,
      recent studies have identified several susceptibility genes for IBS involved in
      the innate immunity and recognition of bacteria but also maintaining the
      integrity of the intestinal barrier. During recent years, it has also been
      demonstrated that IBS patients, or subgroups thereof, may have an altered
      microbiota composition relative to healthy individuals, mainly based on the
      analysis of fecal microbiota. Moreover, a positive effect of treatment with
      non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics in IBS provides further indirect
      support for the relevance of gut microbiota alterations in IBS.

TI  - Fecal excretion of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and changes in fecal microbiota
      after eight weeks of oral supplementation with encapsulated probiotic.
PG  - 201-11
LID - 10.4161/gmic.24196 [doi]
AB  - Certain randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral supplementation with B.
      infantis 35624 have demonstrated the amelioration of symptoms of irritable bowel 
      syndrome. Potential GI colonization by B. infantis 35624 or effects of
      supplementation on resident GI microbiota may pertain to these clinical
      observations. In this study, fecal excretion of B. infantis 35624 before, during 
      and after 8 weeks of daily treatment was compared in subjects with IBS who
      received either the encapsulated oral supplement (n = 39) or placebo (n = 37) and
      in healthy subjects who received the supplement (n = 41). Secondarily, changes in
      assessed fecal microbiota and IBS symptoms were determined. Supplementation
      significantly increased fecal B. infantis 35624 excretion vs. placebo in IBS
      subjects; excretion in healthy subjects receiving supplement was quantitatively
      similar. Fecal levels of the probiotic declined and approached baseline once
      dosing ceased, documenting that colonization is transient. Although
      supplementation increased numbers of B infantis 35624 within the GI tract,
      limited changes in 10 other fecal taxa were observed either in healthy subjects
      or those with IBS. No impact on IBS symptoms was observed. Detection of bacterial
      DNA in fecal samples suggests that the probiotic is able to survive transit
      through the GI tract, although strain selective culture techniques were not
      performed to confirm viability of B. infantis 35624 in the feces. Continuous
      probiotic administration was necessary to maintain steady-state transit. Given
      the complex spectrum of GI microbiota, however, monitoring perturbations in
      selected taxa may not be not a useful indicator of probiotic function.

TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to
      date meta-analysis.
PG  - 19-36
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some
      probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing
      probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous
      data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in 
      cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS:
      meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for
      inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium
      breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48;
      95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; 
      -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve
      (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus
      casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All
      probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI,
      -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07;
      -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus
      salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a 
      clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: 
      some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the
      effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must
      focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the
      immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of a probiotic 'functional food' in the management 
      of irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterised by
      pain, distension and altered bowel habit. Evidence suggests functional foods
      containing probiotics improve gastrointestinal transit, however, data are limited
      by short follow-up periods and evaluation in selected populations. METHODS: A
      multi-centre, randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the effect
      of a probiotic vs non-probiotic dairy product on symptoms in IBS with a
      constipation element (IBS-Constipation or IBS-Mixed profile). Set in 13 general
      practices within central England. Individuals meeting the ROME III criteria for
      IBS, aged 18-65 completed a pre-study diary. Eligible individuals were randomized
      to consume dairy 'yoghurt' products which either did or did not contain active
      probiotics twice daily and to complete a daily diary. Primary outcome was
      subjective global assessment of symptom relief at week 4. Other outcomes
      comprised, IBS symptom scores, pain, bloating and flatulence levels, stool
      frequency, stool consistency, ease of bowel movement and quality of life.
      RESULTS: 179 were randomized (91 active, 88 placebo). 76 (43 active, 33 placebo) 
      completed the study. No significant between group differences existed at 4 weeks 
      (57% active vs 53% placebo, reported adequate relief (p = 0.71)). By week 8, 46% 
      active vs 68% placebo reported adequate relief (p = 0.03). This was sustained at 
      week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements were reported for most outcomes in
      all trial participants but improvement did not differ by group. This trial does
      not provide evidence for effectiveness of a probiotic in IBS, in variance with a 
      body of published literature and review conclusions. Differential drop out may
      however cloud interpretation of data. UK TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN78863629.

AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

AB  - After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the
      development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and
      the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic
      administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews
      significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases
      based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating
      diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain
      Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 
      5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of
      the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality 
      of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative
      colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of
      probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht
      IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics
      containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of
      preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The
      author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In
      Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased
      in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than
      evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims
      for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence
      on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further
      research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the
      international guidelines.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in pediatric diarrheal disorders.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In pediatrics, prebiotics and/or probiotics are added to infant
      formula, mainly to prevent diseases such as diarrheal disorders. Probiotic food
      supplements and medication are frequently used in the treatment of diarrheal
      disorders. This paper reviews the recent published evidence on these topics.
      AREAS COVERED: Relevant literature published using PubMed and CINAHL was
      collected and reviewed. Recent review papers were give special attention. EXPERT 
      OPINION: The addition of pre- and/or probiotics to infant formula seems not
      harmful, but the evidence for benefit is limited. Most probiotics are
      commercialized as food supplements, and therefore do not qualify for medication
      legislation. Worldwide, Saccharomyces boulardii is the only strain which is
      registered as "medication" in the majority of countries. Efficacy data can only
      be considered if performed with the commercialized product. Some products reduce 
      the risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and reduced the duration of acute
      infectious diarrhea with about 24 h. Overall, data in the other indications
      (inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome) are disappointing,
      although there are some recent promising results. The use of food supplements as 
      medication opens the discussion to create a category of "medical food."

      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 403-21

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic
      gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, its lack of satisfactory effective drugs and its 
      complicated pathophysiology lead to the demand of new therapeutic agents. During 
      a new drug development process, the pharmacokinetic profiling is of a great
      considerable importance comparable to drug's efficacy. This involves the drug's
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, all of which are crucial to
      its usefulness. In addition, the toxicological profile and possible adverse
      reactions of the drug should be identified. Also its interactions should be
      identified at different phases of trials. Several pharmacokinetic studies are
      carried out to achieve drugs with the best absorption and bioavailability and the
      least adverse effects and lowest toxicity. AREAS COVERED: To make an update on
      new clinically introduced drugs for IBS and their dynamics and kinetics data, the
      present systematic review was accomplished. All relevant bibliographic databases 
      were searched from the year 2003 up to May 2012 to identify all clinical trials
      that evaluated the potential efficacy of a novel agent in IBS. EXPERT OPINION:
      Some evaluated drugs, such as ramosetron (5-HT3 antagonist) and pexacerfont (CRF1
      receptor antagonist), have shown some benefits in diarrhea-predominant IBS
      (D-IBS), while, prucalopride and mosapride (5-HT4 agonist) with prokinetic effect
      were found useful in constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). Besides,
      dexloxiglumide, lubiprostone and linaclotide have shown beneficial effects in
      C-IBS patients. Melatonin regulates GI tract motility and, asimadoline,
      gabapentin and pregabalin show reduction of pain threshold and visceral
      hypersensitivity. Glucagon-like peptide analog, calcium-channel blockers and
      neurokinin receptor antagonists have shown benefits in pain attacks. More time is
      required to indicate both efficacy and safety in long-term treatment due to
      multifactorial pathophysiology, variations in individual responses and
      insufficient assessment methods, which limit the right decision-making process
      about the efficacy and tolerability of these new drugs.

LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

AB  - The brain-gut axis allows bidirectional communication between the central nervous
      system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), linking emotional and
      cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. Recent
      experimental work suggests that the gut microbiota have an impact on the
      brain-gut axis. A group of experts convened by the International Scientific
      Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) discussed the role of gut
      bacteria on brain functions and the implications for probiotic and prebiotic
      science. The experts reviewed and discussed current available data on the role of
      gut microbiota on epithelial cell function, gastrointestinal motility, visceral
      sensitivity, perception and behavior. Data, mostly gathered from animal studies, 
      suggest interactions of gut microbiota not only with the enteric nervous system
      but also with the central nervous system via neural, neuroendocrine, neuroimmune 
      and humoral links. Microbial colonization impacts mammalian brain development in 
      early life and subsequent adult behavior. These findings provide novel insights
      for improved understanding of the potential role of gut microbial communities on 
      psychological disorders, most particularly in the field of psychological
      comorbidities associated with functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and should present new opportunity for interventions with pro- and
      prebiotics.

PG  - 31-8
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835a3500 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the structural composition of intestinal
      microbiota, the functional relationship between the latter and the host, and the 
      role of abnormal microflora in chronic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: A more complete
      view of the gut microbiota is being developed following the Human Microbiome
      Project. The microflora in children is plastic, susceptible to changes in
      response to diet modifications, antibiotic treatment and other events, providing 
      the opportunity to study its functional role. Increasing evidence highlights the 
      role of nutrition in the age-related development of microflora. Eubiosis, that
      is, a normal microflora structure, provides protection against infections,
      educates the immune system, ensures tolerance to foods, and contributes to
      nutrient digestion and energy harvest. Changes in microflora, consisting in the
      overpresence of harmful species or underpresence of commensal species, or
      dysbiosis produce dysfunctions, such as intestinal inflammation or dysmotility.
      Moreover abnormal pattern of microflora have been consistently detected in
      specific diseases. SUMMARY: A relationship exists between eubiosis and functions 
      and conversely between dysbiosis and dysfunctions or even diseases. Abnormalities
      in microflora composition may trigger or contribute to specific diseases. This
      raises the hypothesis to target microflora in order to restore eubiosis through
      the use of antibiotics, probiotics or nutrients.

TI  - A randomised clinical trial (RCT) of a symbiotic mixture in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): effects on symptoms, colonic transit and quality 
      of life.
PG  - 349-58
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1552-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised
      placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain
      symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is
      only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS.
      METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The
      primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and
      bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of
      treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in
      abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale,
      stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale
      and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time
      (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS
      patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were
      studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of
      treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of
      responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the
      treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in
      most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This
      symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of
      flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect
      profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory
      relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.

AB  - It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important
      elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The
      most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a
      bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in
      the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the
      evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The
      introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major
      advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from
      16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and 
      qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS.
      Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS.
      The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal
      innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate
      nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we
      await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic
      target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics,
      probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although
      most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the
      authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the
      pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of
      microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on 
      modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.
