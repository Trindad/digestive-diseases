TI  - [Lactase deficiency in patients with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and 
      the role of intestinal microflora in its development].
PG  - 91-8
AB  - PURPOSE: to define the frequency of secondary lactase deficiency (SLD) in
      patients with postinfectious IBS and to develop therapy for the correction of
      mild SLD in adult patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this study, 138 patients
      (the mean age - 33.9 +/- 9.09; F/M - 112/26) with postinfectious IBS were
      analyzed concerning lactase deficiency. All patients underwent intestinal
      endoscopy with biopsies from the mucosa of the descending duodenum in order to
      determine lactase deficiency twice before and after therapy. To diagnose small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) all patients underwent lactulose breath
      test during 2 hours. RESULTS: SLD was detected in 59.4% of patients with
      postinfectious IBS. Mild SLD was determined in 43.5% of patients, and severe SLD 
      - in 15.9% of patients. SLD in all cases was accompanied by SIBO (the mean level 
      of lactulose breath test was 101 +/- 37 ppm, N<20 ppm). In group patients who
      took the probiotic during 14 days in 70.8% of patients recovering of lactose
      metabolism in the small intestine and decreasing of the intensity of clinical
      symptoms were registered. The decrease of the lactulose breath test level (86.9
      +/- 40.9 ppm; 17.4 +/- 6.6 ppm; p<0.01) and negative LQT (p<0.01) were registered
      in the first group. In group patients who took placebo during 14 days there was
      no positive effect in 68.4% of cases. CONCLUSION: the probiotic Bifiform,
      composed of Bifidobacterium longum 10(7) and Enterococcus faecium 10(7),
      demonstrated efficiency in correction of mild SLD in patients with postinfectious
      IBS and can be used to prevent SIBO.

AB  - IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which has been subtyped according
      to bowel habits. This review presents recommendations for IBS-D which makes up
      about 1/3 of all patients and which is defined as IBS with loose or watery stools
      with >/=25% of bowel movements. Because IBS is a complex biopsychosocial illness,
      treatment cannot and should not be directed only to altered bowel habits.
      Evidence will be presented for dietary manipulations, probiotics and
      pharmacotherapies including tricyclic agents, antibiotics, serotonin antagonists 
      and anti-diarrhoeal agents in the management of patients with IBS-D.

      potential role for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1159/000342595 [doi]
AB  - Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the
      host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human
      gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut
      microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the
      microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. 
      Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated
      with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable
      to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions.
      Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined
      ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive
      catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by
      a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human
      population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized
      by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their
      co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described
      impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific
      bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary
      habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the 
      other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the 
      fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - [Probiotic supplement (Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus) utility in the
      treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 387-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common functional condition 
      and a frequent cause of consultation in gastroenterology. With a multifactorial
      pathophysiology IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, distension and altered
      bowel habits. Loperamide, antispasmodics and antidepressants are symptomatic
      relievers of this disorder. Recently probiotics were incorporated to therapy, and
      could improve the symptomatology. METHODS: multicenter randomized
      placebo-controlled trial that included IBS patients, diagnosed with Rome III
      criteria. The patients were given pinaverium bromure and placebo or pinaverium
      bromure and probiotics for 3 weeks. The intensity of symptoms and the effect of
      therapy were evaluated with the Francis Score, before and after the treatment.
      Statistics were done with SPSS 12.0 (C.I 95%). RESULTS: 51 patients were
      evaluated, with an average age of 43 years old, mostly mestizo, 75% (38) married 
      and 55% (28) female. There were statistical differences in four variables:
      abdominal pain, intensity of pain, days of pain and total score at the end of
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics used as supplement are effective in improving
      symptomatology of IBS.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics in
      various areas of gastrointestinal (GI) health. Probiotics are defined as live
      microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when
      administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress 
      bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier
      function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials
      are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with
      better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon
      yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the
      current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health.

TI  - The intestinal microbiome, probiotics and prebiotics in neurogastroenterology.
PG  - 17-27
LID - 10.4161/gmic.22973 [doi]
AB  - The brain-gut axis allows bidirectional communication between the central nervous
      system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), linking emotional and
      cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. Recent
      experimental work suggests that the gut microbiota have an impact on the
      brain-gut axis. A group of experts convened by the International Scientific
      Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) discussed the role of gut
      bacteria on brain functions and the implications for probiotic and prebiotic
      science. The experts reviewed and discussed current available data on the role of
      gut microbiota on epithelial cell function, gastrointestinal motility, visceral
      sensitivity, perception and behavior. Data, mostly gathered from animal studies, 
      suggest interactions of gut microbiota not only with the enteric nervous system
      but also with the central nervous system via neural, neuroendocrine, neuroimmune 
      and humoral links. Microbial colonization impacts mammalian brain development in 
      early life and subsequent adult behavior. These findings provide novel insights
      for improved understanding of the potential role of gut microbial communities on 
      psychological disorders, most particularly in the field of psychological
      comorbidities associated with functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and should present new opportunity for interventions with pro- and
      prebiotics.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic constipation (CC) are common problems 
      worldwide and are associated with significant impact on activities of daily
      living and quality of life. Recent interest, in IBS in particular, has focused on
      the potential roles of the microbiota and its interaction with the host's immune 
      system. Recently, high-quality clinical trials have been performed on prebiotics 
      and probiotics in IBS or CC. Although strategies that seek to modify the
      microbiota, such as the use of probiotics, offer much promise in IBS and CC, more
      high-quality trials and, studies of longer duration are required.

PG  - 430-5
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent and invalidating functional bowel
      disorder with entangled mechanisms. Its therapeutic approach is therefore
      complex. Classical therapies, prescribed alone or in combination in light of the 
      predominant symptom, consist of antispasmodics, fibers, laxatives,
      antidiarrheals, and psychotropic agents. Other emerging pharmacological
      therapies, such as prokinetics, prosecretory or serotoninergic agents, bile acid 
      modulators and antibiotics have been recently studied in clinical trials. Dietary
      measures can include reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (FODMAPs) and gluten restriction. Assessment of food allergy can be proposed in a
      subgroup of IBS patients. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies, that 
      are generally low cost and safe, appear to be appreciated by patients. Probiotics
      have demonstrated action on the gut microbiote modulation, and may be helpful in 
      a subset of patients. Peppermint oil has an established visceral analgesic
      effect. Hypnotherapy represents an original, global and effective approach.
      Finally, education, reassurance and listening to the patient, leading to a solid 
      therapeutic relationship, represents an essential backdrop of remedy or diet
      effectiveness.

AB  - In the past few years, intestinal microbiota has emerged as a novel target for
      the treatment of gut-brain axis alterations. These include functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can be 
      comorbid with stress-related psychiatric conditions. Thus, modulation of the
      microbiota (e.g. with the use of probiotics) could be proposed as a novel
      strategy not only for the treatment of IBS but also as an adjuvant for
      psychiatric treatment of anxiety and depression.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The human gastrointestinal lumen is inhabited by a wide
      variety of microbiota. Our understanding of the intestinal microbiota and its
      full consequences on gastrointestinal health is still evolving. However, it is
      well accepted that altered colonic flora drives the pathogenesis of many
      disorders and diseases as seen in antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium 
      difficile infection. Recent works published in the area of probiotics are
      reviewed here. RECENT FINDINGS: Alterations in colonic microbiota, or dysbiosis, 
      are now implicated in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Probiotics and prebiotics are evolving treatment options that are targeted at
      restoring nonpathogenic digestive flora. There has been great interest in the
      role of these therapies in treatment of many diseases including childhood
      diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. SUMMARY: Trials of
      probiotics have been shown to be helpful in some of these, not in others, and
      more work is needed in others. We review recent work done in these areas.

AB  - We summarize and discuss the studies presented at the congress of the American
      Association of Gastroenterology (Digestive Disease Week) that, in our opinion,
      are of greatest interest. Both clinically and physiopathologically, functional
      gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are highly complex. A single cause is unlikely to
      explain symptoms as heterogeneous as those of functional dyspepsia and irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, it is easier (and more useful) to try to
      understand functional GI disorders using a bio-psycho-social model. Moreover,
      data supporting the combined importance of genetic, organic and psychological
      factors in the onset and persistence of functional GI disorders are increasingly 
      convincing. This year, new data have been provided on pharmacogenetics in
      gastroparesis, on microinflammation or alterations in the modulation of somatic
      and visceral sensitivity in functional dyspepsia, and on the impact of
      psychological factors in IBS. From the therapeutic point of view, further
      information has been provided on the role of probiotics, the antinociceptive
      effect of linaclotide (demonstrated in several studies presented this year), and 
      on the high efficacy of hypnotherapy in patients with IBS. Finally, data on the
      clinical management of patients with constipation due to pelvic floor dyssynergia
      and on the safety and efficacy of prucalopride in patients with severe
      constipation were also of interest.

AB  - Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders constitute the majority of
      patients seeking healthcare for gastrointestinal symptoms in primary and
      secondary care. Of these disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the
      most common and affects 10-20% in the Western world. IBS is a functional bowel
      disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and
      alteration of bowel habits in the absence of any detectable organic cause. Sex
      and gender aspects are important in understanding differences between men and
      women in their risk and experience of IBS. Relative to men, women are diagnosed
      more frequently with IBS. Female patients are more likely to be constipated,
      complain of abdominal distension and of certain extracolonic symptoms. Given the 
      variability of IBS, the most successful treatment will be comprehensive,
      involving multiple strategies. Efficacy, safety and tolerability are important in
      the evaluation of IBS therapies, as patients are likely to require long-term
      treatment. Laxatives, antidiarrheals or antispasmodics are common in the
      treatment of IBS but the majority of patients receive antispasmodics followed by 
      prokinetic agents. In treatment of IBS there appears to be a greater clinical
      response to serotonergic agents developed for IBS in women compared to men. There
      is an absence of drugs licensed specifically for the treatment of IBS. Further
      studies with novel agents are needed, to evaluate new approaches to IBS
      management including gender specific behavioral therapies and better
      characterization of patient subgroups with regard to drug therapy so that
      personalized therapy can be tested.

      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - S52-5
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318264e918 [doi]
AB  - There is increasingly convincing evidence supporting the participation of the gut
      microenvironment in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Studies particularly suggest an interplay between luminal factors (eg, foods and 
      bacteria residing in the intestine), the epithelial barrier, and the mucosal
      immune system. Decreased expression and structural rearrangement of tight
      junction proteins in the small bowel and colon leading to increased intestinal
      permeability have been observed, particularly in postinfectious IBS and in IBS
      with diarrhea. These abnormalities are thought to contribute to the outflow of
      antigens through the leaky epithelium, causing overstimulation of the mucosal
      immune system. Accordingly, subsets of patients with IBS show higher numbers and 
      an increased activation of mucosal immunocytes, particularly mast cells. Immune
      factors, released by these cells, including proteases, histamine, and
      prostanoids, participate in the perpetuation of the permeability dysfunction and 
      contribute to the activation of abnormal neural responses involved in abdominal
      pain perception and changes in bowel habits. All these mechanisms represent new
      targets for therapeutic approaches in IBS. Probiotics are an attractive
      therapeutic option in IBS given their recognized safety and by virtue of positive
      biological effects they can exert on the host. Of importance for the IBS
      pathophysiology is that preclinical studies have shown that selective probiotic
      strains exhibit potentially useful properties including anti-inflammatory
      effects, improvement of mucosal barrier homeostasis, beneficial effects on
      intestinal microbiota, and a reduction of visceral hypersensitivity. The effect
      of probiotics on IBS is positive in most randomized, controlled studies, although
      the gain over the placebo is small. Identifying tailored probiotic approaches for
      subgroups of IBS patients represents a challenge for the future.

AB  - AIM: To investigate whether composite yogurt with acacia dietary fiber and
      Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) has additive effects in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A total of 130 patients were randomly allocated to
      consume, twice daily for 8 wk, either the composite yogurt or the control
      product. The composite yogurt contained acacia dietary fiber and high-dose B.
      lactis together with two classic yogurt starter cultures. Patients were evaluated
      using the visual analog scale via a structured questionnaire administered at
      baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in bowel habit satisfaction
      and overall IBS symptoms from baseline were significantly higher in the test
      group than in the control group (27.16 vs 15.51, P = 0.010, 64.2 +/- 17.0 vs 50.4
      +/- 20.5, P < 0.001; respectively). In constipation-predominant IBS, improvement 
      in overall IBS symptoms was significantly higher in the test group than in the
      control group (72.4 +/- 18.4 vs 50.0 +/- 21.8, P < 0.001). In patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS, improvement in bowel habit satisfaction from baseline
      was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (32.90 vs
      7.81, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that composite yogurt enriched
      with acacia fiber and B. lactis has greater therapeutic effects in patients with 
      IBS than standard yogurt.

AB  - The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome following 
      an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (pos-infectious irritable bowel syndrome)
      illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause
      this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other
      observations, as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the
      enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have,
      somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in irritable bowel syndrome research,
      given their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are
      associated with irritable bowel syndrome. While evidence for immune dysfunction
      both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological
      limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in
      irritable bowel syndrome. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a
      firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in irritable
      bowel syndrome, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency.
      Despite its prevalence, there is a striking lack of effective therapeutic options
      for irritable bowel syndrome. While there is reason for optimism in the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome with several promising new agents
      currently undergoing clinical trials, confirmation of the efficacy and safety of 
      these agents in wider patient populations is awaited. A clearer understanding of 
      the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      of interrelationships between irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal
      and non-gastrointestinal disorders, will likely be required before effective drug
      therapies can be found.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is defined as abdominal discomfort or pain associated
      with altered bowel habits for at least three days per month in the previous three
      months, with the absence of organic disease. In North America, the prevalence of 
      irritable bowel syndrome is 5 to 10 percent with peak prevalence from 20 to 39
      years of age. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom and often is described as
      a cramping sensation. The absence of abdominal pain essentially excludes
      irritable bowel syndrome. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, constipation,
      or alternating diarrhea and constipation. The goals of treatment are symptom
      relief and improved quality of life. Exercise, antibiotics, antispasmodics,
      peppermint oil, and probiotics appear to improve symptoms. Over-the-counter
      laxatives and antidiarrheals may improve stool frequency but not pain. Treatment 
      with antidepressants and psychological therapies are also effective for improving
      symptoms compared with usual care. Lubiprostone is effective for the treatment of
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, and alosetron (restrictions
      for use apply in the United States) and tegaserod (available only for emergency
      use in the United States) are approved for patients with severe symptoms in whom 
      conventional therapy has been ineffective.

AB  - Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a
      considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is
      referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional
      diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of
      coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid
      intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a
      preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of
      underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at 
      decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying
      precipitating food items.

AB  - Intestinal microflora can be considered an organ of the body. It has several
      functions in the human gut, mostly metabolic and immunologic, and constantly
      interacts with the intestinal mucosa in a delicate equilibrium. Chronic diarrhea 
      is associated with an alteration of gut microbiota when a pathogen invades the
      gut and also in several conditions associated with intestinal mucosal damage or
      bowel dysfunction, as in inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or
      small bowel bacterial overgrowth. This article discusses the basis of gut
      microbiota modulation. Evidence for the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation in 
      chronic conditions is also discussed.

AB  - AIM: To assess the symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (L.
      plantarum 299v) (DSM 9843) for the relief of abdominal symptoms in a large subset
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria.
      METHODS: In this double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-designed study,
      subjects were randomized to daily receive either one capsule of L. plantarum 299v
      (DSM 9843) or placebo for 4 wk. Frequency and intensity of abdominal pain,
      bloating and feeling of incomplete rectal emptying were assessed weekly on a
      visual analogue scale while stool frequency was calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      and fourteen IBS patients were recruited. After 4 wk, both pain severity (0.68 + 
      0.53 vs 0.92 + 0.57, P < 0.05) and daily frequency (1.01 + 0.77 vs 1.71 + 0.93, P
      < 0.05) were lower with L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) than with placebo. Similar
      results were obtained for bloating. At week 4, 78.1 % of the patients scored the 
      L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) symptomatic effect as excellent or good vs only 8.1 
      % for placebo (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A 4-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299v
      (DSM 9843) provided effective symptom relief, particularly of abdominal pain and 
      bloating, in IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal
      (GI) tract disorder with significant disability and a considerable financial
      burden to health service due to the consumption of resources including
      investigations, physician time, and cost of treatment. Despite availability of
      multiple treatment options, there is still poor functional recovery. AREAS
      COVERED: Probiotics has been investigated as a promising treatment for IBS, and
      have demonstrated beneficial effects in some patients. There are many clinical
      trials investigating the therapeutic benefits of probiotics in IBS but most of
      them are heterogenic in terms of dose or species used and clinical endpoints.
      However, recent major meta-analyses revealed benefits of probiotics in patients
      with IBS. Inhibition of binding of pathogenic bacteria to intestinal epithelial
      cells, enhancing barrier function of intestinal epithelial, acidification of the 
      colon, suppression of the growth of pathogens, modulation of immunity, inhibition
      of visceral hypersensitivity, alteration in mucosal response to stress, and
      improvement of bowel dysmotility are among mechanisms that probiotics may act.
      Most commonly used probiotics come from the genera Bifidobacterium and
      Lactobacillus but other species are in trial. EXPERT OPINION: Although further
      studies are still needed, current evidences are almost enough to convince experts
      that probiotics are efficient in the treatment of IBS.

TI  - A randomised clinical trial (RCT) of a symbiotic mixture in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): effects on symptoms, colonic transit and quality 
      of life.
PG  - 349-58
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1552-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised
      placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain
      symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is
      only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS.
      METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a
      symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The
      primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and
      bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of
      treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in
      abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale,
      stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale
      and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time
      (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS
      patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were
      studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of
      treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of
      responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the
      treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in
      most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This
      symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of
      flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect
      profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory
      relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.

PG  - 99-104
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is evidence suggesting that intestinal microbiota plays a
      role in the development of irritable bowel syndrome. Its activity can be
      indirectly assessed using the lactulose breath test. Antibiotics like rifaximin
      or probiotics can be used as therapeutic options for patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome. Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of a sequential
      treatment with rifaximin and probiotics in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      We prospectively evaluated patients with diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome
      according to Rome III criteria. Included patients had to fill in a questionnaire 
      in order to assess their symptoms severity. A lactulose breath test was also
      performed in each case and a curve with the results of hydrogen concentration and
      time was elaborated. Then, the area under the curve was calculated After initial 
      evaluation, patients received a seven-day treatment with rifaximin, followed by a
      ten-day course of probiotics. Thirty days after completion of treatment a new
      lactulose breath test along with a questionnaire were performed. RESULTS: We
      included 15 patients and 93% experienced a significant improvement of their
      symptoms as well as a significant reduction of the lactulose breath test values. 
      CONCLUSION: Sequential treatment with rifaximin/probiotics seems to be effective 
      for symptom and fermentative profile improvement in irritable bowel syndrome
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of biocomplexes "Normoflorin L,
      B" in the treatment of functional bowel disease with constipation syndrome. The
      study involved 30 patients with functional bowel disease (Rome criteria III,
      2006), with irritable bowel syndrome with predominance of constipatio--16 people 
      with functional constipation--14 people. The criteria of efficacy were: the
      dynamics of clinical symptoms, bacteriological examination of feces before and
      after treatment, intestinal transit time of Activated Charcoa- "carbolen" test
      the definition of short-chain fatty acids (SFA) in the feces by gas-liquid
      chromatography before and after treatment. The results of the study. In
      Normoflorin therapy there comes normalization of intestinal motor activity;
      positive changes in colon ecosystem, consisting of changes of methabolic activity
      of colonic microflora and its generic composition, normalization of
      anaerobic-aerobic relations, restoration of intracavitary redox potential of the 
      luminal environment; eliminating the symptoms of intestinal dyspepsia (rumbling, 
      flatulence). Bio-complexes Normofloriny are characterized by good tolerability
      and safety. The positive effect of "aftereffect" of drugs persists for at least 2
      weeks. These data allow us to recommend the use of bio-complexes Normofloriny in 
      treatment of functional bowel disease. These data allow to recommend the use of
      bio-complexes Normofloriny in treatment of functional bowel disease.

      malabsorption state?
PG  - 489-93
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328356662d [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the relevant publications during the last 12
      months supporting that diet can influence gas-related symptoms in the absence of 
      a malabsorption state. RECENT FINDINGS: Gas symptoms during carbohydrate
      fermentation: a diet incorporating beans is well tolerated by a majority of
      individuals involved in a program of heart disease biomarkers. By contrast, in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a diet avoiding fermentable carbohydrates
      improved gas-related abdominal symptoms. The rate of fermentation determines the 
      production of abdominal symptoms, and many slowly fermentable fibers have a rapid
      fermentation profile that can generate abdominal symptoms. Modulation of visceral
      sensitivity: diet can influence gas symptoms by increasing the tolerability of
      the intestine to gas. Capsaicin decreases visceral hyperalgesia and improved
      bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Changes in gas-producing
      bacteria: different strains of Lactobacillus have antimicrobial properties
      against gas-forming coliforms. New clinical studies show beneficial effects of
      prebiotics and probiotics on abdominal bloating. SUMMARY: Actual data suggest
      that diet could improve gas-related abdominal symptoms acting on several
      mechanisms: gas production, visceral hypersensitivity and modulation of
      gas-producing enteric bacteria.

TI  - Diverticular disease as a chronic illness: evolving epidemiologic and clinical
      insights.
PG  - 1486-93
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.194 [doi]
AB  - Diverticular disease imposes a significant burden on Western and industrialized
      societies. The traditional pathogenesis model posits that low dietary fiber
      predisposes to diverticulosis, and fecalith obstruction prompts acute
      diverticulitis that is managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics or surgery.
      However, a growing body of knowledge is shifting the paradigm of diverticular
      disease from an acute surgical illness to a chronic bowel disorder composed of
      recurrent abdominal symptoms and considerable psychosocial impact. New research
      implicates a role for low-grade inflammation, sensory-motor nerve damage, and
      dysbiosis in a clinical picture that mimics irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      even inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Far from being an isolated event, acute
      diverticulitis may be the catalyst for chronic symptoms including abdominal pain,
      cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and "post-diverticulitis IBS." In
      addition, studies reveal lower health-related quality of life in patients with
      chronic diverticular disease vs. controls. Health-care providers should maintain 
      a high index of suspicion for the multifaceted presentations of diverticular
      disease, and remain aware that it might contribute to long-term emotional
      distress beyond traditional diverticulitis attacks. These developments are
      prompting a shift in therapeutic approaches from widespread antimicrobials and
      supportive care to the use of probiotics, mesalamine, and gut-directed
      antibiotics. This review addresses the emerging literature regarding
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of chronic, symptomatic
      diverticular disease, and provides current answers to common clinical questions.

PG  - 159-76

AB  - It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important
      elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The
      most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a
      bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in
      the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the
      evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The
      introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major
      advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from
      16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and 
      qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS.
      Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS.
      The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal
      innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate
      nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we
      await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic
      target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics,
      probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although
      most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the
      authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the
      pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of
      microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on 
      modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.

TI  - IBS-associated phylogenetic unbalances of the intestinal microbiota are not
      reverted by probiotic supplementation.
PG  - 406-13
AB  - IBS is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder, in which the microbiota 
      has been demonstrated to play a role. An increasing number of studies have
      suggested how probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms and several mechanisms of
      action have been proposed. In the present study we characterized the intestinal
      microbiota of 19 subjects suffering from diagnosed IBS using a fully validated
      High Taxonomic Fingerprint Microbiota Array (HTF-Microbi.Array). We demonstrated 
      that the IBS microbiota is different from that of healthy individuals due to an
      unbalance in a number of commensal species, with an increase in relative
      abundance of lactobacilli, B. cereus and B. clausii, bifidobacteria, Clostridium 
      cluster IX and E. rectale, and a decrease in abundance of Bacteroides/Prevotella 
      group and Veillonella genus. Additionally, we demonstrated that some bacterial
      groups of the human intestinal microbiota, recently defined as pathobionts, are
      increased in concentration in the IBS microbiota. Furthermore, we aimed at
      investigating if the daily administration of a novel probiotic yogurt containing 
      B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 and K. marxianus B0399, recently demonstrated to
      have beneficial effects in the management of IBS symptoms, could impact on the
      biostructure of IBS microbiota, modulating its composition to counteract putative
      dysbiosis found in IBS subjects. Notably, we demonstrated that the beneficial
      effects associated to the probiotic preparation are not related to significant
      modifications in the composition of the human intestinal microbiota.

PG  - 860-e398

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tricyclic antidepressants have good efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), but their clinical use is limited by
      considerations of tolerability. Tianeptine, another antidepressant, acts as a
      selective serotonin reuptake enhancer. We compared tianeptine with amitriptyline 
      for the treatment of patients with IBS-D. METHODS: We undertook a multicenter,
      randomized, open-label, non-inferiority clinical study that compared tianeptine
      with amitriptyline, each in combination with probiotics, for the treatment of
      IBS-D. Subjects were randomized to receive tianeptine (37.5 mg)/probiotics
      (Bacillus subtilis + Streptococcus faecium) or amitriptyline (10 mg)/probiotics
      (Bacillus subtilis + Streptococcus faecium) for 4 weeks. A total of 228 patients 
      were analyzed by the intention-to-treat approach. The primary efficacy endpoint
      was the proportion of patients who had global relief of IBS symptoms at week 4.
      The secondary efficacy endpoints were intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort,
      stool frequency/consistency, quality of life, and overall satisfaction with
      treatment. KEY RESULTS: At week 4, non-inferiority of the tianeptine group to the
      amitriptyline group (treatment difference -15.1%; 95% CI -26.6% to -3.8%) was
      shown, with 81.1% (99 of 122 patients) of the patients in the tianeptine group
      and 66.0% (70 of 106 patients) in the amitriptyline group reporting global relief
      of IBS symptoms. The secondary endpoints also demonstrated non-inferiority of the
      tianeptine group to the amitriptyline group. Adverse events such as dry mouth and
      constipation were significantly lower in the tianeptine group than the
      amitriptyline group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Tianeptine is not
      inferior to amitriptyline for treating IBS-D in terms of both efficacy and
      tolerability.

PG  - 594-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture and
      probiotics combine Deanxit in treating diarrhea predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (D-IBS). METHODS: Totally 64 D-IBS patients accompanied with anxiety
      and/or depression were randomly assigned to the Western medicine group (Group A) 
      and the electroacupuncture (EA) group (Group B), 30 patients in Group A and 34
      patients in Group B. Patients in Group A took Bacillus licheniformis and Deanxit,
      while those in Group B received EA. Four weeks consisted of one therapeutic
      course. Three-month follow-up was carried out. The scoring for the digestive
      tract symptoms, HAMA score, and HAMD score were evaluated before and after
      treatment. The recurrence in the 3-month follow-up was also observed. RESULTS:
      The total effect rate was 86.67% in Group A and 88.24% in Group B with no
      statistical difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was statistical
      difference in the scoring for the digestive tract symptoms, HAMA score, and HAMD 
      score (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the
      improvement of defecation frequency score, HAMA score, HAMD score between the two
      groups after treatment (P > 0.05). Better effects on improving abdominal pain
      score and abdominal distention score was obtained in Group B (P < 0.01), while
      better effects on improving the stool form score and mucus score were obtained in
      Group A (P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the recurrence rate
      between the two groups within the two-month follow-up (P > 0.05). The recurrence 
      rate within the 3-month follow-up was obviously lower in Group B than in Group A 
      (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EA and Western medicine (probiotics combined Deanxit)
      could effectively treat D-IBS patients accompanied with anxiety and/or
      depression. Both of them had different superiorities in improving symptoms. But
      EA had better long-term therapeutic effects.

TI  - Efficacy and safety profile of LCR35 complete freeze-dried culture in irritable
      bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 2067-75
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i17.2067 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the effects and safety of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus LCR35
      complete freeze-dried culture (LCR35) in patients suffering from irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in 
      50 patients complaining of IBS symptoms complying with Rome III criteria.
      Patients were allocated to receive either LCR35 (n = 25) at a minimum daily dose 
      of 6 x 10(8) colony forming units or placebo (n = 25) for 4 wk. At inclusion,
      after treatment and 2 wk later, patients completed the IBS severity scale. Change
      from baseline in the IBS severity score at the end of treatment was the primary
      efficacy criterion. Changes were compared between groups in the whole population 
      and in IBS subtypes (IBS with predominance of constipation, IBS with predominance
      of diarrhoea, mixed IBS, unsubtyped IBS). The presence of lactobacillus casei
      rhamnosus in stools was investigated at inclusion and at the end of treatment.
      The gastrointestinal quality of life questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and
      depression (HAD) scale were also completed. RESULTS: Both groups were balanced
      for baseline characteristics. In 85% of patients, stool analyses showed that
      lactobacillus casei rhamnosus able to survive in the digestive tract. In the
      whole population, improvements in the IBS severity score did not differ
      significantly between treatments with a 25% decrease after 4-wk treatment, and a 
      15% decrease from baseline 2 wk later in both groups. In IBS subgroups,
      statistical analysis could not be performed due to small sample size, but a
      clinical response in favour of LCR35 was observed in IBS patients with
      predominance of diarrhoea: no change in the symptom severity score was seen with 
      the placebo after 4 wk treatment, whereas a clinically relevant decrease occurred
      with LCR35 (-37% vs -3%). Furthermore, in spite of an increase in symptom
      intensity, the IBS severity score was maintained below the baseline value 2 wk
      later with LCR35 (-19% from baseline), whilst a slight 5% increase from baseline 
      was observed with placebo. In the IBS subgroup with predominance of diarrhoea
      only, a clinically relevant decrease in abdominal pain severity score (-36%) was 
      observed with LCR35, whereas no change occurred with placebo. In mixed IBS
      patients, the 20% and 30% decreases in the IBS severity score observed after
      treatment with LCR35 and placebo, respectively, were maintained 2 wk later in
      both groups. A clinical response slightly in favour of placebo was observed at
      the end of the treatment period in IBS patients with predominance of constipation
      (-41% vs -20%) and unsubtyped IBS patients (-47% vs -17%), with the same value
      maintained 2 wk later. In both groups, no clinically relevant changes were
      observed either for the gastrointestinal quality of life index or HAD score.
      Thus, these results suggest that sub-grouping of IBS patients may be important
      for optimizing treatment responses by the physician. CONCLUSION: This pilot study
      suggests that LCR35 could have some efficacy in IBS patients complaining of
      diarrhoea. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in larger studies.

TI  - A meta-analysis of probiotic efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - e34938
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific
      gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease
      prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for
      treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with
      differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed.
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included randomized controlled trials in humans
      that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of Pouchitis,
      Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium
      difficile Disease, Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, Traveler's Diarrhea, or
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis. Random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy
      as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic
      species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of
      treatment. Probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight
      gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (CI) 0.51-0.65). Six 
      of the eight diseases: Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, 
      Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, and Antibiotic Associated
      Diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. Traveler's Diarrhea and
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. Of the
      11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except
      for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium
      infantis. Across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects
      of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and 
      treatment lengths. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics are generally beneficial 
      in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Efficacy was not
      observed for Traveler's Diarrhea or Necrotizing Enterocolitis or for the
      probiotic species L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and B. infantis. When choosing to
      use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the
      type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to 
      take into consideration.

TI  - A gastroenterologist's guide to probiotics.
PG  - 960-8
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2012.03.024 [doi]
AB  - The enteric microbiota contribute to gastrointestinal health, and their
      disruption has been associated with many disease states. Some patients consume
      probiotic products in attempts to manipulate the intestinal microbiota for health
      benefit. It is important for gastroenterologists to improve their understanding
      of the mechanisms of probiotics and the evidence that support their use in
      practice. Clinical trials have assessed the therapeutic effects of probiotic
      agents for several disorders, including antibiotic- or Clostridium
      difficile-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and the inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Although probiotic research is a rapidly evolving field, there
      are sufficient data to justify a trial of probiotics for treatment or prevention 
      of some of these conditions. However, the capacity of probiotics to modify
      disease symptoms is likely to be modest and varies among probiotic strains-not
      all probiotics are right for all diseases. The current review provides
      condition-specific rationale for using probiotic therapy and literature-based
      recommendations.

TI  - Probiotics in the gastrointestinal diseases of the elderly.
PG  - 402-10
AB  - Changes of the gut microflora in elderly appear to involve a reduction in numbers
      of healthy bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and an increase in numbers 
      of potentially pathogenic species. These changes are generally described as
      gastrointestinal disorders and infections. This review analyses benefits of
      probiotics in old people, with particular interesting for the latest researches
      relevant to elderly people, e.g. trials examining enteric infections,
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea,
      functional bowel problems (constipation and irritable bowel syndrome),
      inflammatory bowel diseases, stimulation of the immune system and prevention of
      cancer. A growing number of researches indicates that some probiotic strains may 
      help to maintain the health in old people, suggesting both health and cost-saving
      benefits in offering fermented dairy products. These benefits include:
      establishment of balanced intestinal microflora; improving colonization
      resistance and or prevention of diarrhea; reduction of fecal enzymes; reduction
      of serum cholesterol; reduction of potential mutagenes; reduction of lactose
      intolerance; synthesis of vitamins; predigestion of proteins.

TI  - British Dietetic Association evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management
      of irritable bowel syndrome in adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional
      gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management
      strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects
      of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based
      guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet 
      and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These
      included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP),
      fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or
      elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant
      studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic
      database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and
      Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and
      research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically 
      appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of
      treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary
      management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy 
      eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP.
      Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP,
      fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical
      diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for
      adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS:
      These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful 
      dietary management of IBS.

TI  - Regulation of the stress response by the gut microbiota: implications for
      psychoneuroendocrinology.
PG  - 1369-78
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.03.007 [doi]
AB  - There is now an expanding volume of evidence to support the view that commensal
      organisms within the gut play a role in early programming and later responsivity 
      of the stress system. The gut is inhabited by 10(1)(3)-10(1)(4) micro-organisms, 
      which is ten times the number of cells in the human body and contains 150 times
      as many genes as our genome. It has long been recognised that gut pathogens such 
      as Escherichia coli, if they enter the gut can activate the HPA. However, animals
      raised in a germ-free environment show exaggerated HPA responses to psychological
      stress, which normalises with monocolonisation by certain bacterial species
      including Bifidobacterium infantis. Moreover, increased evidence suggests that
      animals treated with probiotics have a blunted HPA response. Stress induces
      increased permeability of the gut allowing bacteria and bacterial antigens to
      cross the epithelial barrier and activate a mucosal immune response, which in
      turn alters the composition of the microbiome and leads to enhanced HPA drive.
      Increasing data from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and major depression 
      indicate that in these syndromes alteration of the HPA may be induced by
      increased gut permeability. In the case of irritable bowel syndrome the increased
      permeability can respond to probiotic therapy. Detailed prospective studies in
      patients with mood disorders examining the gut microbiota, immune parameters and 
      HPA activity are required to throw further light on this emerging area. It is
      however clear that the gut microbiota must be taken into account when considering
      the factors regulating the HPA.

AB  - The human body is home to more than 1 trillion microbes, with the
      gastrointestinal tract alone harboring a diverse array of commensal microbes that
      are believed to contribute to host nutrition, developmental regulation of
      intestinal angiogenesis, protection from pathogens, and development of the immune
      response. Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies and metagenomic
      analysis are providing a broader understanding of these resident microbes and
      highlighting differences between healthy and disease states. The aim of this
      review is to provide a detailed summary of current pediatric microbiome studies
      in the literature, in addition to highlighting recent findings and advancements
      in studies of the adult microbiome. This review also seeks to elucidate the
      development of, and factors that could lead to changes in, the composition and
      function of the human microbiome.

TI  - The Rome II and Rome III criteria identify the same subtype-populations in

AB  - BACKGROUND: For comparing trials using different classifications for irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) subtypes, it is important to know whether these identify the
      same sub-populations. Our aim was to determine the agreement between Rome II and 
      Rome III subtypes, and to explore whether agreement depends on the symptom
      reporting method. METHODS: Rome II IBS patients from two identical, randomized
      placebo-controlled trials of probiotics were included. Retrospective subtypes
      were based on the Rome II questionnaire. Prospective subtypes were based on diary
      cards for 2 weeks of run-in. Agreement was determined between: (i) retrospective 
      Rome II and Rome III, (ii) prospective Rome II and Rome III, (iii) retrospective 
      Rome II and prospectively Rome III, (iv) retrospective and prospective Rome II,
      and (v) retrospective and prospective Rome III. KEY RESULTS: A total of 126
      patients, 72% women, mean age 46 +/- 15 years, were included. The agreement
      between subtypes using the same symptom reporting method was: (i) 90.3% (kappa = 
      0.85) for retrospective subtypes, and (ii) 84% (kappa = 0.76) for prospective
      subtypes. The agreement between subtypes using different symptom reporting
      methods was, (iii) 49% (kappa = 0.23) for retrospective Rome II and prospective
      Rome III, (iv) 51% (kappa = 0.26) for Rome II subtypes, and (v) 41% (kappa =
      0.25) for Rome III subtypes. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Agreement between Rome II 
      and Rome III subtypes is good to very good when using the same symptom reporting 
      method. When mixing methods, agreement is only fair even within the same
      classification. This has implications for comparison of trials using different
      symptom reporting methods for subtyping.

TI  - Experiences of patients with chronic gastrointestinal conditions: in their own
      words.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-10-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      are chronic conditions affecting millions of individuals in the United States.
      The symptoms are well-documented and can be debilitating. How these chronic
      gastrointestinal (GI) conditions impact the daily lives of those afflicted is not
      well documented, especially from a patient's perspective. METHODS: Here we
      describe data from a series of 22 focus groups held at three different academic
      medical centers with individuals suffering from chronic GI conditions. All focus 
      groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Two research team members
      independently analyzed transcripts from each focus group following an agreed upon
      coding scheme. RESULTS: One-hundred-thirty-six individuals participated in our
      study, all with a chronic GI related condition. They candidly discussed three
      broad themes that characterize their daily lives: identification of disease and
      personal identity, medications and therapeutics, and daily adaptations. These all
      tie to our participants trying to deal with symptoms on a daily basis. We find
      that a recurrent topic underlying these themes is the dichotomy of experiencing
      uncertainty and striving for control. CONCLUSIONS: Study participants' open
      dialogue and exchange of experiences living with a chronic GI condition provide
      insight into how these conditions shape day-to-day activities. Our findings
      provide fertile ground for discussions about how clinicians might best
      facilitate, acknowledge, and elicit patients' stories in routine care to better
      address their experience of illness.

PG  - 64-9
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of
      gastrointestinal tract, affecting significant number of western population. The
      characteristic features are chronic and(or) recurrent abdominal pain and
      discomfort associated with changes in the bowel habit with or without bloating.
      According to Rome Criteria III there is an improved focus on the intestinal
      transit time which allows for better diagnosis and characterization of patients
      either with diarrhea, constipation predominant or mixed type IBS. Patients with
      IBS also frequently manifest various symptoms related to central nervous system
      (CNS) as depression or personality disorders. In this review we present current
      knowledge concerning etiopathogenesis of IBS with emphasis on the role of
      microbiota and describe promissing profilatic and treatment modalities with
      anti-biotics and probiotics capable to modulate microbiota and gut-brain axis.
      Most recent studies concerning clinical efficacy of antibiotic rifaximin and
      probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum 299v in symptom prevention (reduction)
      of this common gastrointestinal disorder are briefly described.

TI  - The shortcomings of clinical trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 112-9
LID - 10.1089/acm.2011.0015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical trials within the past decade have aimed to study
      the safety and efficacy of various probiotic strains in treating patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there exists much heterogenicity in
      study design among these trials, namely, in bacterial strain, dose, dosage form, 
      sample size, study duration, and population demographics. AIM: The aim of this
      study was to identify the shortcomings of clinical trials using probiotic
      treatments in subjects with IBS, so that researchers may realize where
      limitations exist, allowing them to curtail these limitations in future trials.
      METHODS: An extensive PubMed search was conducted using the following keywords:
      probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, probiotic pharmacokinetics,
      Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Alosetron, Tegaserod, Alosetron, and Tegaserod
      safety profile. A total of 62 articles were used in constructing this review,
      with 20 original articles. RESULTS: Stark differences in study design existed
      among the 20 original articles analyzed, as well as an outstandingly high
      "placebo effect," making the ability to compare these articles as a means for
      evidence-based treatment therapy in IBS very difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Future
      large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials must be
      conducted, embodying minimal variability in study designs, to appropriately
      assess the efficacy of specific probiotic strains over placebo.

TI  - Stress and the gut: pathophysiology, clinical consequences, diagnostic approach
      and treatment options.
PG  - 591-9
AB  - Stress, which is defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, shows both short- and
      long-term effects on the functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to
      stress results in alterations of the brain-gut interactions ("brain-gut axis")
      ultimately leading to the development of a broad array of gastrointestinal
      disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal diseases, food antigen-related
      adverse responses, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The
      major effects of stress on gut physiology include: 1) alterations in
      gastrointestinal motility; 2) increase in visceral perception; 3) changes in
      gastrointestinal secretion; 4) increase in intestinal permeability; 5) negative
      effects on regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal mucosa and mucosal blood
      flow; and 6) negative effects on intestinal microbiota. Mast cells (MC) are
      important effectors of brain-gut axis that translate the stress signals into the 
      release of a wide range of neurotransmitters and proinflammatory cytokines, which
      may profoundly affect the gastrointestinal physiology. IBS represents the most
      important gastrointestinal disorder in humans, and is characterized by chronic or
      recurrent pain associated with altered bowel motility. The diagnostic testing for
      IBS patients include routine blood tests, stool tests, celiac disease serology,
      abdominal sonography, breath testing to rule out carbohydrate (lactose, fructose,
      etc.) intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is
      recommended if alarming symptoms are present or to obtain colonic biopsies
      especially in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. The management of IBS is
      based on a multifactorial approach and includes pharmacotherapy targeted against 
      the predominant symptom, behavioural and psychological treatment, dietary
      alterations, education, reassurance and effective patient-physician relationship.
      When evaluating for the stress-induced condition in the upper GI tract, the
      diagnostic testing includes mainly blood tests and gastroscopy to rule out GERD
      and peptic ulcer disease. The therapy for these conditions is mainly based on the
      inhibition of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors and eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori-infection. Additionally, melatonin an important mediator of
      brain gut axis has been shown to exhibit important protective effects against
      stress-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, probiotics may
      profoundly affect the brain-gut interactions ("microbiome-gut-brain axis") and
      attenuate the development of stress-induced disorders in both the upper and lower
      gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on the brain-gut axis are needed to open 
      new therapeutic avenues in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a poorly understood, yet highly
      prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). The withdrawal, due to
      adverse events, of a number of pharmacological agents that were approved for the 
      treatment of IBS has left a therapeutic vacuum for patients suffering from the
      disorder. AIM: To review, summarise and critically evaluate current knowledge of 
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used to treat IBS. METHODS: We assessed a
      comprehensive range of relevant literature from Pubmed, Medline and online
      sources based on our definition of LAB which included both typical and atypical
      species, covering Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, Enterococci, Streptococci and
      Bacilli. RESULTS: Of the 42 trials evaluated examining the efficacy of LAB in
      IBS, 34 reported beneficial effects in at least one of the endpoints or symptoms 
      examined, albeit with tremendous variation in both the magnitude of effect and
      the choice of outcome under consideration. However, numerous concerns have been
      expressed over deficits of trial design and execution relating to strain
      selection, optimum dosage, mode of action, safety and long-term tolerability in a
      disorder that can persist throughout the lifetime of affected individuals.
      CONCLUSIONS: Progress in the field will require an improved understanding of how 
      the microbiota impacts on health and disease, adequately powered long-term
      multicentre trials and the embracing of bench to bedside approaches. Recent
      incremental advances suggest these areas are being addressed and that the future 
      holds much promise for the use of lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Indications for the use of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 574-87
LID - 10.1159/000332980 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are present in foods or dietary
      supplements and that confer health benefits to the host when ingested in
      sufficient quantities. Probiotics can be bacterial (e.g. Bifidobacteria spp. and 
      Lactobacillus spp.) or yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii). The administration 
      of probiotics is often believed to be by and large beneficial for individuals
      with inflammatory or infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These
      positive effects are generally attributed to the ability of probiotics to
      regulate intestinal permeability, normalize host intestinal flora, improve gut
      immune barrier function, and equilibrate the balance between proinflammatory and 
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, however, these claims are not always
      substantiated by findings from properly conducted clinical trials. Of particular 
      importance, even when results from randomized controlled trials support the
      beneficial effects of a particular probiotic for a specific indication, the
      benefits achieved by the probiotic are generally not translatable to other
      probiotic formulations. This review discusses the gastrointestinal indications
      for probiotic use and describes the level of evidence that supports the use of
      specific probiotics for these indications. Several indications are addressed,
      including enteric infections, gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, 
      necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subtyping is used in research and
      clinical practice. Knowledge of subtype stability is needed for proper design of 
      trials and treatment strategies. AIMS: To evaluate the stability of Rome III IBS 
      subtypes over time and to determine the optimal time period for prospective,
      diary-based subtyping. METHODS: Rome III IBS patients aged 18-70 years enrolled
      in two identical, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of probiotics, were
      included. No difference was found on stool pattern, thus patients were analysed
      as one group. Patients scored defaecations according to Bristol Stool Form Scale 
      for 10 weeks. IBS subtypes were determined for all 1- and 2-week periods. Subtype
      distribution and stool pattern over time were determined. The proportions of
      patients having the same subtype all weeks (stable patients) or having a
      predominant subtype (same subtype >/=60% of time) were determined. RESULTS: A
      total of 126 patients, mean age 46 +/- 15 years, 72% women were included. Subtype
      distribution was similar over time with IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhoea
      and IBS unsubtyped constituting one-third of the population each. Even though
      only 18-35% had the same subtype all weeks, the majority of patients had the same
      subtype for >/=60% of time (82-98%). Sixty-nine per cent had the same predominant
      and baseline subtypes. Two-week data increased the proportion of stable patients,
      of patients with a predominant subtype, and of patients who had similar baseline 
      and predominant subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Most IBS patients change subtype over time.
      However, an underlying stool pattern stability was demonstrated in the majority
      of patients. To increase stability, we recommend 2-week data for IBS subtyping.

TI  - The effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal
      microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 220-7
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31823712b1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      is still controversial. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic
      mixture on IBS symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with 
      diarrhea-dominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Fifty patients with D-IBS were randomized
      into placebo or probiotic mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus
      plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium
      lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 CFU)
      groups. Treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was adequate
      relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. A
      responder was defined as a patient who experienced AR for at least half of the
      10-week study period. Secondary outcomes included the effects on individual
      symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS quality of life. The fecal flora compositions
      were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The proportion of AR was consistently higher in 
      the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period
      (P<0.05). The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics
      group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, P=0.01). Stool consistency improved
      significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. Percent
      changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but IBS
      quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group.
      Comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora
      showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after 
      treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo
      group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic mixture was
      effective in providing AR of overall IBS symptoms and improvement of stool
      consistency in D-IBS patients, although it had no significant effect on
      individual symptoms. The therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the 
      stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the therapeutic effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle
      1917 (EcN) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and identify subgroups benefiting
      most. BACKGROUND: Some trials investigating therapeutic effects in irritable
      bowel syndrome have shown benefits in IBS subgroups only. Probiotic treatment
      seems to be promising. METHODS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (120; Rome
      II) were recruited to a prospective double-blind study and randomized to either
      EcN (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60) given for 12 weeks. Objectives were to describe 
      efficacy and safety of EcN in different groups of irritable bowel syndrome.
      Outcome was assessed by 'Integrative Medicine Patient Satisfaction Scale'.
      RESULTS: Altogether, the responder rate was higher in the EcN than in the placebo
      group. However, only after 10 and 11 weeks, the differences were significant
      (Delta 20.0% points [95% CI 2.6; 37.4], p = 0.01 and Delta 18.3% points [95% CI
      1.0; 35.7], p = 0.02, respectively). The best response was observed in the
      subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel
      syndrome onset (Delta 45.7% points, p = 0.029). No significant differences were
      observed in any other subgroup. Both treatment groups showed similar adverse
      events and tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic EcN shows effects in irritable bowel
      syndrome, especially in patients with altered enteric microflora, e.g. after
      gastroenterocolitis or administration of antibiotics.

AB  - The synbiotic concept was first introduced, along with prebiotics, as "mixtures
      of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the
      survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the
      gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by
      activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting
      bacteria, thus improving host welfare" (Gibson & Roberfroid 1995). Since, there
      have been many in vitro and in vivo studies focusing on the application of
      prebiotics, firstly in health and gradually in disease states. Only recently have
      studies on synbiotics started to emerge with the main focus being on applications
      against disease. Here, we review the current literature, with the main focus on
      in vivo human studies.

      disorders in adults.
PG  - 195-200
LID - 10.1177/0884533611423926 [doi]
AB  - For decades, if not centuries, a variety of products with what would now be
      regarded as prebiotic and probiotic properties have been consumed by the general 
      public and advocated for their benefits on health and, in particular,
      gastrointestinal well-being. More recently, medical science has taken a great
      interest in the population of micro-organisms, the gut microbiota that normally
      populates the human gut, and the range of important functions carried out by the 
      microbiota in health is being progressively defined. As a corollary, the list of 
      disorders and diseases that may result from disruption of the normal microbiota
      and/or its interaction with the host continues to grow. A scientific basis for
      the use of probiotics and prebiotics is, therefore, beginning to emerge.
      Unfortunately, although progress has been made, the clinical evidence to support 
      the use of these preparations lags behind. Nevertheless, a number of human
      disease states may benefit from the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal
      illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases, certain infectious disorders, and
      irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria, and
      although a variety of health benefits have been attributed to their use,
      prebiotics have been subjected to few large-scale clinical trials.

PG  - 489-96

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various
      gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current 
      attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for
      probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing,
      types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and
      clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were
      mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK.
      RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said 
      they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients,
      including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The
      most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing
      yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more
      popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were
      irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of
      prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants 
      had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their
      routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is
      necessary.

TI  - Chronic constipation: current treatment options.
PG  - 22B-28B
AB  - Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects
      patients of all ages. In 2007, a consensus group of 10 Canadian
      gastroenterologists developed a set of recommendations pertaining to the
      management of chronic constipation and constipation dominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. Since then, tegaserod has been withdrawn from the Canadian market. A
      new, highly selective serotonin receptor subtype 4 agonist, prucalopride, has
      been examined in several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials
      demonstrating its efficacy and safety in the management of patients with chronic 
      constipation. Additional studies evaluating the use of stimulant laxatives,
      polyethylene glycol and probiotics in the management of chronic constipation have
      also been published. The present review summarizes the previous recommendations
      and new evidence supporting different treatment modalities - namely, diet and
      lifestyle, bulking agents, stool softeners, osmotic and stimulant laxatives,
      prucalopride and probiotics in the management of chronic constipation. A brief
      summary of lubiprostone and linaclotide is also presented. The quality of
      evidence is presented by adopting the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
      Development and Evaluation system. Finally, a management pyramid for patients
      with chronic constipation is proposed based on the quality of evidence, impact of
      each modality on constipation and on general health, and their availabilities in 
      Canada.

AB  - Modulating the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract through probiotics is an 
      alternative to the conventional treatment of various diseases, based on synthetic
      drugs. The lifestyle, nutrition and stress of the present modern society could be
      among the factors responsible for modifications in the intestinal microbiota,
      correlated with specific diseases. The present study describes the positive
      effects of probiotics use, with special reference to the yeasts use in several
      frequently encountered diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia, the irritable
      bowel syndrome, gastritis and several uro-genital disorders.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: the role of the intestinal microbiota, pathogenesis and
      therapeutic targets.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that
      predominantly affects women and accounts for up to 40% of the gastroenterology
      unit outpatient visits. The pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. In the
      present review we will focus on the role of intestinal dysbiosis in its
      pathogenesis and treatment. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) can put light on the
      mechanisms underlying IBS. Modified commensal gut flora may lead to mucosal
      inflammation. Several changes such as an increase in mucosal cellularity
      (enterochromaffin cells, lamina propria T lymphocytes and mast cells), modified
      pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and disordered
      neurotransmission have been observed. The normal microbiota is an essential
      factor in health. A modification of the flora, such as small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) is thought to play a pathogenic role in IBS. Changes in the
      composition of the luminal and mucosal colonic flora have been linked to IBS. It 
      is not clear however, whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of the
      syndrome. The comprehension of the interaction between the dysbiotic microbiota
      and the host will probably lead to the development of focused therapies. Based on
      these assumptions, treatments modulating the microbiota have been investigated.
      On the one hand several probiotics have shown a reduction in IBS symptoms by an
      immunomodulatory and analgesic effects. On the other hand antibiotic treatment
      has proven efficacy in treating IBS with or without associated SIBO. Due to its
      complex pathophysiology, treating IBS nowadays implies multiple approaches, one
      of which may be modulation of the intestinal flora.

TI  - Novel diagnostics and therapy of colonic motor disorders.
PG  - 624-9
LID - 10.1016/j.coph.2011.10.002 [doi]
AB  - Colonic motor abnormalities are implicated in several gastrointestinal disorders 
      including constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and functional diarrhoea.
      Defining the colonic abnormalities is difficult and several novel techniques
      including, high-resolution fibre optic manometry, wireless motility capsules,
      ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have emerged to help in the diagnosis
      of these conditions. Coupled with the developing techniques are the novel
      treatments that look to restore normal colonic motility. These treatments include
      pharmacological agents (pharmabiotics, serotonin agonist, secretagogues) and
      medical devices (sacral nerve stimulation, transcutaneous electrical stimulation 
      and biofeedback). This review summarizes the novel techniques used to record and 
      define colonic motor abnormalities and the current status of the emerging
      treatments used to treat them.

AB  - Thanks to rapid progress in the development and application of molecular
      techniques to the assessment of the human gut microbiome, the true nature,
      diversity and metabolic potential of this 'hidden organ' are being revealed.
      Simultaneously, the complex physiological, immunological and metabolic
      interactions between host and microbiome are being untangled. By contrast, the
      probiotic concept has been with us for decades and, while supported more by fad
      and folklore in the past, is now gaining support, not only from experimental work
      in animal models, but also by well-designed studies in human diseases, most
      notably infectious diarrheas, inflammatory bowel disease and the irritable bowel 
      syndrome.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use-2011 update.
PG  - S168-71
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318230928b [doi]
AB  - This study describes the consensus opinion of the participants of the third Yale 
      Workshop on probiotic use. There were 10 experts participating. The
      recommendations update those of the first 2 meetings that were published in 2005 
      and 2008. The workshop presentations and papers in this supplement relate to the 
      involvement of normal microbiota involved in intestinal microecology, how the
      microbes interact with the intestine to affect our immunologic responses, the
      stability and natural history of probiotic organisms, and the role of the
      intestinal microbatome with regard to affecting cardiac risk factors and obesity.
      Recommendations for the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis, childhood
      diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium
      difficile diarrhea are reviewed. As in previous publications, the recommendations
      are given as A, B, or C ratings. The recent positive experiences with
      bacteriotherapy (fecal microbiome transplant) are also discussed in detail and a 
      positive recommendation is made for use in severe resistant C. difficile
      diarrhea.

      syndrome.
PG  - S145-8
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31822d32d3 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unknown. However, 
      several lines of epidemiological, physiological, and clinical data suggest a role
      for intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recent microbiology 
      studies demonstrated differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota 
      between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. In addition, physiological
      studies have shown that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotics,
      prebiotics, or probiotics can affect intestinal functions (eg, motility and
      sensation) relevant in the pathogenesis of IBS. Several randomized control trials
      comparing the effects of probiotics versus placebo in IBS have been published.
      Despite considerable differences in study design, dosing regimens, probiotic
      species used, and reported clinical end points, the current data indicate
      improving IBS symptoms and reducing the risk of persistent IBS symptoms. The data
      on the use of probiotics in children with IBS is more limited but is also
      suggestive for beneficial effects. The inconsistencies between the studies
      underline the need to look at each probiotic product separately for specific
      conditions, symptoms, and patient populations. This review article discusses the 
      rationale for targeting the intestinal microbiota in patient with IBS and
      provides an overview and a critical evaluation of the currently available
      clinical data on the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with IBS.

AB  - The objective of this research was to study the efficacy and safety of capsule
      'UB03' to treat patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Thirty patients
      with Rome II IBS were assigned to receive capsule 'UB03' (10 billion lyophilised 
      bacteria and yeast/capsule produced by Unique Biotech Limited, India) twice daily
      for 90 days. Assessment of IBS was carried out according with Rome II criteria
      and their severity for 90 days of treatment with an interval of 30 days. Complete
      haemogram, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum creatinine were performed
      as a part of safety evaluation at the time of inclusion and after 90 days of
      treatment. There was significant improvement in frequency of defecation (23%),
      consistency of stool, abdominal discomfort, bloating and flatulence. However,
      there was no significant change in abdominal pain and mucus in stool. This trial 
      demonstrates that the consumption of capsule 'UB03' containing potential
      probiotic strains is found to be effective and safe for the treatment of patients
      with IBS.

AB  - Strains of Saccharomyces boulardii, a probiotic yeast, have been found to be
      effective in the treatment of diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable
      bowel syndrome and other conditions. In the present study, Unique 28, a strain of
      S. boulardii isolated and characterised in our laboratory, was evaluated for its 
      safety assessment. Acute and subacute toxicity tests were performed in rats. The 
      dose of Unique 28 (5x10(9) cfu/g) fed orally was, up to 6,500 mg per kg of b.w.
      (body weight) for acute toxicity and up to 1,300 mg per kg of b.w. for sub-acute 
      toxicity studies. This dose was well tolerated and there was no morbidity or any 
      kind of toxic clinical symptoms displayed either in male or female rats.
      Moreover, the results of sub-acute toxicity studies using Unique 28 administered 
      for 14 weeks indicated that there were no clear unwanted treatment related
      effects. Overall results of this toxicology assessment indicate that Unique 28 is
      safe for human consumption.

TI  - BDNF expression in the hippocampus of maternally separated rats: does
      Bifidobacterium breve 6330 alter BDNF levels?
PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.3920/BM2011.0015 [doi]
AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is of interest because of its putative
      role in stress and psychiatric disorders. Maternal separation is used as an
      animal model of early-life stress and of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Animals 
      exposed to the paradigm show altered gut function together with heightened levels
      of arousal and corticosterone. Some probiotic organisms have been shown to be of 
      benefit in IBS and influence the brain-gut axis. Our objective was to investigate
      the effects of maternal separation on BDNF under basal conditions and in response
      to the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve 6330. The study implemented the maternal
      separation model which we have previously described. Polymerase chain reaction
      and in situ hybridisation were performed to measure the effect of maternal
      separation on both BDNF total variants and BDNF splice variant (exon) IV in the
      hippocampus. Maternally separated and non-separated rats were treated with B.
      breve 6330, to investigate the effect of this probiotic on BDNF total variant and
      BDNF exon IV expression. Maternal separation increased BDNF total variants
      (P<0.01), whilst having no effect on BDNF exon IV. B. breve 6330 increased BDNF
      total variants (P<0.01), and decreased BDNF splice variant IV, in non-separated
      rats (P<0.01). B. breve 6330 did not alter BDNF levels in the maternally
      separated rats. Maternal separation caused a marked increase in BDNF in the
      hippocampus. While B. breve 6330 influenced BDNF in normal animals, it had no
      significant effect on BDNF in those which were maternally separated. We have
      demonstrated that an orally administered probiotic can influence hippocampal
      BDNF.

TI  - Effect of herbal extract granules combined with probiotic mixture on irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhea: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 219
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-12-219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder
      characterized by abdominal pain and change of bowel habits without organic
      disease. Many patients seek alternative IBS treatments because of the limitations
      of conventional treatments. Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS), a herbal formula, has long
      been used for alleviating diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional
      medicine. Duolac7S, which comprises 7 bacterial species as probiotics, has been
      frequently used for D-IBS. Although GJS and Duolac7S have been administered
      simultaneously in many D-IBS patients, no study has investigated the effects of
      GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. METHODS/DESIGN: The current trial 
      is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm study. After a 2-week 
      run-in period, 60 patients with D-IBS will be randomly assigned to one of the 4
      combination groups consisting of GJS (water extract granules, 3 g/pack, 3 times a
      day) with Duolac7S (powder form, 1 capsule, 2 times a day) or their placebos and 
      followed up for 2 weeks. The assigned treatments will last for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcomes are adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort and the
      proportion of responders (on a weekly basis). The secondary outcomes are visual
      analog scale for IBS symptoms (on a daily basis), quality of life (at 0, 8, and
      10 weeks), intestinal permeability, and composition of intestinal microbiota (at 
      0 and 8 weeks). DISCUSSION: The present study is designed to examine the safety
      and efficacy of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. Our study provides
      the clinical evidence of a new therapeutic strategy for D-IBS.

TI  - Enterococci as probiotics and their implications in food safety.
PG  - 125-40
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.08.014 [doi]
AB  - Enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and they are of importance
      in foods due to their involvement in food spoilage and fermentations, as well as 
      their utilisation as probiotics in humans and slaughter animals. However, they
      are also important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and 
      other infections. Some strains are resistant to many antibiotics and possess
      virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, pili and haemolysin. The role of
      enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or
      as probiotics. Studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal
      strains isolated from food showed that some can harbour virulence traits, but it 
      is also thought that virulence is not the result of the presence of specific
      virulence determinants alone, but is rather a more intricate process. Specific
      genetic lineages of hospital-adapted strains have emerged, such as E. faecium
      clonal complex (CC) 17 and E. faecalis CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40, which are high
      risk enterococcal clonal complexes. These are characterised by the presence of
      antibiotic resistance determinants and/or virulence factors, often located on
      pathogenicity islands or plasmids. Mobile genetic elements thus are considered to
      play a major role in the establishment of problematic lineages. Although
      enterococci occur in high numbers in certain types of fermented cheeses and
      sausages, they are not deliberately added as starter cultures. Some E. faecium
      and E. faecalis strains are used as probiotics and are ingested in high numbers, 
      generally in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. Such probiotics are
      administered to treat diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea or irritable
      bowel syndrome, to lower cholesterol levels or to improve host immunity. In
      animals, enterococcal probiotics are mainly used to treat or prevent diarrhoea,
      for immune stimulation or to improve growth. From a food microbiological point of
      view, the safety of the bacteria used as probiotics must be assured, and data on 
      the major strains in use so far indicate that they are safe. The advantage of use
      of probiotics in slaughter animals, from a food microbiological point of view,
      lies in the reduction of zoonotic pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract of
      animals which prevents the transmission of these pathogens via food. The use of
      enterococcal probiotics should, in view of the development of problematic
      lineages and the potential for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract of
      both humans and animals, be carefully monitored, and the advantages of using
      these and new strains should be considered in a well contemplated risk/benefit
      analysis.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in the management of irritable bowel syndrome: a review
      of recent clinical trials and systematic reviews.
PG  - 581-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32834b8082 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the
      gastrointestinal tract, about which there has been considerable recent research. 
      The aim of this article is to briefly review the aspects of IBS pathogenesis that
      involve the gastrointestinal microbiota, and then to critically appraise the
      recent and emerging evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in its
      management. RECENT FINDINGS: The increased risk of developing IBS following
      gastroenteritis and the co-existence of dysbiosis, elevated luminal gas
      production and immune activation, indicate that the gastrointestinal microbiota
      may be a therapeutic target in IBS. Most systematic reviews indicate that
      probiotics have a beneficial impact on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and
      flatulence. However, recent trials indicate that different probiotics can
      improve, have no effect, or even worsen symptoms, confirming that benefits are
      likely to be strain and symptom-specific. There are no recent clinical trials of 
      prebiotics in IBS, although previous studies indicate potential benefit at lower 
      doses. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the
      management of IBS; however, the benefits are likely to be strain-specific.
      Preliminary studies suggest low doses of prebiotics may improve symptoms of IBS, 
      although further robust clinical trials are required.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that leads
      to crampy pain, gassiness, bloating, and changes in bowel habits in the absence
      of any currently identifiable organic disorder. Patients with IBS may be
      classified by their predominant bowel habit: diarrhea-predominant,
      constipation-predominant, or IBS with alternating bowel movements. IBS is often
      associated with stress or anxiety. Although IBS can be frustrating and concerning
      to patients with this disorder, it does not cause permanent harm to the
      intestines and does not lead to a serious disease such as cancer. Although
      treatments exist for its symptoms, there is no known cure.

PG  - 491-6
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328349eb4d [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the importance of nutrition in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to improve. With increasing evidence
      or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of
      nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment 
      of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel
      syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized
      in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because
      of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against
      new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now
      beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin
      D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory
      effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a
      randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and
      micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of
      all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding
      of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more
      effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like
      immune-suppressants should be explored.

PG  - 397-401
AB  - Several studies with probiotics have shown promising results in the treatment of 
      IBS. One of the probiotics used was saccharomyces boulardii. This is a randomized
      double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of S. boulardii in diarrhoea
      predominant IBS and was carried out in the hospital of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib
      Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from June 2004 to July 2005. Thirty
      five (35) patients were included in each of the control and study groups. The
      study group was treated with S. boulardii 250 mg twice daily orally for one
      month. Patients were evaluated before therapy, at the end of therapy and 30 days 
      after end of therapy by a scoring system which included symptoms as well as
      personal and professional life. No significant difference between the two groups 
      was found in any of the parameters evaluated on any of the observation days. S.
      boulardii treatment for 30 days in diarrhoea predominant IBS patients did not
      result in any improvement in this study.

TI  - Abdominal bloating and distension: what is the role of the microbiota.
PG  - 4-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1834-4 [doi]
AB  - Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome complain of a sensation of an
      increase in pressure within their abdomen during the course of the day which is
      called bloating and, in approximately half of these individuals, this symptom is 
      accompanied by an actual increase in abdominal girth, which is referred to as
      distension. The pathophysiology of these two phenomena is somewhat different and 
      it is now recognised that a whole variety of overlapping mechanisms are involved.
      Some of these are potentially amenable to treatment by modification of the
      bacterial flora of the gut and this article reviews the evidence for this.

TI  - Clinical applications of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders in children.
PG  - 153-60
AB  - Probiotics are widely used in promoting human health and adjunctive therapy of
      human disease. Many clinical trials and research studies have shown benefits of
      probiotics. We review the literature associated with the clinical applications of
      probiotics in paediatric diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis, infantile
      colic, infectious diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection, antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhoea, constipation, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease,
      irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain. We also summarize the
      representative probiotics that are commonly used in paediatric diseases.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in prevention and treatment of diseases in infants and 
      children.
PG  - 292-300
LID - 10.2223/JPED.2103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of probiotics and prebiotics on the health of
      children. SOURCES: MEDLINE and LILACS were searched for relevant English and
      French-language articles. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Human milk is rich in
      prebiotic oligosaccharides and may contain some probiotics. No data suggest that 
      addition of probiotics to infant formula may be harmful, but evidence of its
      efficacy is insufficient for its recommendation. Since data suggest that addition
      of specific prebiotic oligosaccharides may reduce infections and atopy in healthy
      infants, their addition to infant formula seems reasonable. Long-term health
      benefits of pro- and prebiotics on the developing immune system remain to be
      proven. Selected probiotics reduce the duration of infectious diarrhea by 1 day, 
      but evidence in prevention is lacking, except in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. 
      Some specific probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, and other
      microorganisms may be beneficial in Helicobacter pylori gastritis and in
      infantile colic. Evidence is insufficient to recommend probiotics in prevention
      and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The use of probiotics in constipation,
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and extra-intestinal
      infections requires more studies. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of administration,
      microbial dosage, and species used need further validation for both pro- and
      prebiotics. Unjustified health claims are a major threat for the pro- and
      prebiotic concept.

      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 2791-800
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v17.i23.2791 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined by the Rome III criteria as symptoms of
      recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort with the onset of a marked change in bowel
      habits with no evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic
      process. As such, many clinicians regard IBS as a central nervous system problem 
      of altered pain perception. Here, we review the recent literature and discuss the
      evidence that supports an organic based model, which views IBS as a complex,
      heterogeneous, inter-dependent, and multi-variable inflammatory process along the
      neuronal-gut axis. We delineate the organic pathophysiology of IBS, demonstrate
      the role of inflammation in IBS, review the possible differences between adult
      and pediatric IBS, discuss the merits of a comprehensive treatment model as
      taught by the Institute of Functional Medicine, and describe the potential for
      future research for this syndrome.

TI  - How patients view probiotics: findings from a multicenter study of patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318225f545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to 
      improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about
      probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they
      consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and
      expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in
      collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted
      with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns
      Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common
      themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred
      thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August
      2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical
      drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option.
      Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their
      gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics,
      their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering 
      probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many
      unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD
      and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy
      advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to
      pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for
      patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits
      and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about
      their use.

PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04737.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is emerging regarding the relationship between a dysbiosis
      of the human gut microbiota and a number of gastrointestinal diseases as well as 
      diseases beyond the gut. Probiotics have been investigated in many
      gastrointestinal disease states, with variable and often modest outcomes. Faecal 
      transplantation is an alternative approach to manipulate the gut microbiota. AIM:
      To review the use of faecal transplantation therapy for the management of
      gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: Available articles on faecal transplantation
      in the management of gastrointestinal disorders were identified using a Pubmed
      search and bibliographies of review articles on the subject were collated.
      RESULTS: A total of 239 patients who had undergone faecal transplantation were
      reported. Seventeen of 22 studies of faecal transplantation were in fulminant or 
      refractory Clostridium difficile. Studies of faecal transplantation are
      heterogeneous regarding the patients, donors, screening, methods of
      administration and definition of response. Faecal transplantation for C.
      difficile has been demonstrated to be effective in 145/166 (87%) patients. Small 
      numbers of patients are reported to have undergone successful faecal
      transplantation for irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
      CONCLUSIONS: Faecal transplantation has been reported with good outcomes for
      fulminant and refractory C. difficile. No adverse effects of faecal
      transplantation have been reported. However, there are no level 1 data of faecal 
      transplantation and reports to date may suffer from reporting bias of positive
      outcomes and under-reporting of adverse effects. This therapy holds great
      promise, where a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is responsible for disease and
      further studies are necessary to explore this potential.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review interactions between the microbiota and the host in 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), emphasizing 
      areas of commonality and divergence. RECENT FINDINGS: Several lines of evidence
      support a role for the microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and IBD. Some
      implicate the microbiota in a general sense and relate to variations in the
      composition of the microbiota between IBS, IBD and controls; others relate to the
      ability of events and interventions that disrupt/modify the microbiota to
      predispose to the development of IBS and IBD and, others still refer to reports
      of the ability of antibiotics, prebiotics or probiotics, in selected
      circumstances, to beneficially alter their clinical course. Enthusiasm for a role
      for a specific organism in precipitating disease has been largely (and
      contentiously) linked to IBD. Many issues remain unresolved and must wait for the
      application of modern microbiological techniques to well characterized
      populations and well matched controls. SUMMARY: It makes sense, given the size
      and complexity of the microbiota and its role in homeostasis, that the microbiota
      and its interactions with the host would play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS
      and IBD; sorting out the details has proven challenging but does offer new
      therapeutic avenues for both disorders.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional disorder of the
      gastrointestinal tract. The exact cause is unknown. The diagnosis should be made 
      on clinical grounds, using symptom-based criteria such as the Manning or Rome
      criteria, unless symptoms are thought to be atypical. Excluding celiac disease in
      all patients consulting with symptoms suggestive of IBS is worthwhile, but
      evidence for performing other investigations to exclude organic disease is not
      convincing. No medical therapy for IBS has been shown to alter the disease
      course, and treatment has traditionally been directed towards symptom relief. The
      aim should be to improve the predominant symptom reported by the patient. Fiber, 
      peppermint oil, or antispasmodic agents are beneficial as first-line therapies in
      some patients. Where these fail, emerging data have confirmed the efficacy of
      antidepressants, drugs acting on the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, and probiotics
      in the short-term treatment of IBS. There are a number of novel therapies under
      development that show promise, including non-absorbable antibiotics,
      lubiprostone, and linaclotide. This article will provide a summary of diagnostic 
      criteria for IBS, evidence to support investigations to exclude organic disease, 
      and current and emerging therapies in this field.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel
      syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are
      reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of
      medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of
      lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to
      provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to
      treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom
      endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles 
      published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome',
      'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre',
      'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone',
      'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine',
      hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative
      entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide',
      'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated
      for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for
      explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of
      abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete
      evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are
      reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified
      58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS
      symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies
      suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements,
      lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor
      inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine,
      octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is
      the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various
      pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific
      symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to
      better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult
      syndrome.

AB  - Acute infectious gastroenteritis is the strongest known risk factor for the
      development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the most common functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders. The knowledge about the incidence and prevalence of
      post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) in the general population is still limited. Risk
      factors have been identified in the development of PI-IBS. These include the
      virulence of the pathogen, younger age, female sex, the long duration of the
      initial illness and the presence of psychological disturbances. Histopathologic
      data demonstrate a low-grade mucosal inflammation in a subset of patients with
      IBS. Furthermore, a change in intestinal microflora could also be involved
      although confirmatory studies are required. The use of probiotics or non
      absorbable antibiotics during the acute infective episode could play a preventive
      role. Nonetheless, the discovery that an infective episode may trigger the
      development of IBS has not substantially changed the clinical management of this 
      subset of patients compared to the classical (non infective) form of IBS. Future 
      studies aimed at identifying specific therapies are waited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A lack of reliable treatments for abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders prompts interest in new therapies. AIM: To evaluate
      systematically the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating
      abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children.
      METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, trial registries and
      proceedings of major meetings were searched for randomised controlled trials
      (RCTs) evaluating LGG supplementation in children with abdominal pain-related
      functional gastrointestinal disorders based on the Rome II or Rome III criteria. 
      Risk of bias was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation
      concealment, blinding and follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, LGG
      supplementation was associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment
      responders (defined as no pain or a decrease in pain intensity) in the overall
      population with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (three RCTs, n = 290; risk ratio, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59, number needed to
      treat, NNT 7, 95% CI 4-22) and in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subgroup
      (three RCTs, n = 167; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.27, NNT 4, 95% CI 3-8). However, no 
      difference was found in the rate of treatment responders between children with
      functional abdominal pain or functional dyspepsia who received placebo or LGG.
      The intensity of pain was significantly reduced in the overall study population
      and in the IBS subgroup. The frequency of pain was significantly reduced in the
      IBS subgroup only. CONCLUSION: The use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG moderately
      increases treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, particularly among children with IBS.

AB  - GOALS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of probiotics on adult
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through clinical parameters and H
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics. BACKGROUND: As systematic
      effect of probiotics on inflammatory bowel disease through metabonomics approach 
      has been extensively studied to date, metabonomic characterization of the
      probiotics effect on IBS is also needed for better understanding the effect with 
      respect to host metabolic mechanism. STUDY: Seventy-four IBS patients meeting
      Rome criteria were randomized to receive probiotics and placebo through a
      parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study.
      Probiotic fermented milk and placebo were administered 3 times daily for 8 weeks.
      Improvements of IBS were assessed according to Rome III questionnaires and H NMR 
      metabolic profiling of serum and fecal samples from all participants was used to 
      characterize a significant change in serum and fecal metabolome before and after 
      probiotics. RESULTS: Fecal counts of the Lactobacilli, but not Bifidobacteria
      species, which included in the probiotic milk, were increased significantly in
      feces of IBS patients receiving treatment (P=0.014). NMR data set coupled with
      multivariate statistical analysis identified intrinsically elevated serum levels 
      of glucose (P=0.0265) and tyrosine (P=0.0016) in IBS patients. These levels
      normalized to those of healthy individuals in the probiotic administration group,
      but not the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This metabonomic study suggests that in a
      subset of IBS patients there exists a potential dysregulation in energy
      homeostasis (serum glucose) and liver function (serum tyrosine) that may be
      improved through probiotics supplementation. Moreover, global metabolic profiling
      highlights the potential of metabonomic approach for assessing bowel diseases or 
      symptoms with respect to host metabolic perturbation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal bloating and distension are common symptoms in patients
      with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), however, relatively little is
      known about their treatment. AIM: To review the treatment trials for abdominal
      bloating and distension. METHODS: A literature review in Medline for
      English-language publications through February 2010 of randomised, controlled
      treatment trials in adults. Study quality was assessed according to Jadad's
      score. RESULTS: Of the 89 studies reviewed, 18% evaluated patients with
      functional dyspepsia, 61% with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 10% with chronic
      constipation and 10% with other FGIDs. No studies were conducted in patients
      diagnosed with functional abdominal bloating. The majority of trials investigated
      the efficacy of prokinetics or probiotics, although studies are heterogeneous
      with respect to diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. In general, bloating
      and/or distension were evaluated as secondary endpoints or as individual symptoms
      as part of a composite score rather than as primary endpoints. A greater
      proportion of IBS patients with constipation reported improvement in bloating
      with tegaserod vs. placebo (51% vs. 40%, P<0.0001) and lubiprostone (P<0.001). A 
      greater proportion of nonconstipating IBS patients reported adequate relief of
      bloating with rifaximin vs. placebo (40% vs. 30%, P<0.001). Bloating was
      significantly reduced with the probiotics, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624
      (1x10(8) dose vs. placebo: -0.71 vs. -0.44, P<0.05) and B. animalis (live vs.
      heat-killed: -0.56+/-1.01 vs. -0.31+/-0.87, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Prokinetics,
      lubiprostone, antibiotics and probiotics demonstrate efficacy for the treatment
      of bloating and/or distension in certain FGIDs, but other agents have either not 
      been studied adequately or have shown conflicting results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms has been mixed, but remains
      an intriguing treatment option with appeal to the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized double-blind to a daily 
      intake of 500 ml of fermented milk containing at least 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml of
      Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and
      Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or an equal volume of acidified milk for 8 weeks.
      Symptoms were assessed at baseline and weekly using a disease-specific validated 
      symptom rating scale (IBS-SSI). The predefined primary outcome measure was
      patient reported adequate symptom relief. Adherence to study protocol were
      assessed by performing stool samples at the of the treatment period. RESULTS:
      Eight-one patients were screened. Sixty-four patients were randomized; 18
      patients did not complete the study due to protocol violations or withdrew due to
      lack of effect. Fifty-two patients (13 males) completed the study as per
      protocol; mean age was 51.3 years (range 29-67). The proportion of patients
      reporting adequate symptom relief increased in both patient groups, but there was
      not any statistical difference between the groups. IBS-SSI scores did not differ 
      statistically between the groups at the end of the treatment period, but improved
      during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: During this 8-week trial
      gastrointestinal symptoms improved. However, there was no difference between
      treatment with fermented milk containing probiotics or acidified milk. The effect
      of probiotics on IBS symptoms remains uncertain and further studies are
      warranted.

TI  - Probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis
      Bi-07 versus placebo for the symptoms of bloating in patients with functional
      bowel disorders: a double-blind study.
PG  - 518-25
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31820ca4d6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest a role for the intestinal microbiota in the
      pathogenesis of functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Probiotic studies in FBDs
      generated inconsistent results suggesting a strain-specific and product-specific 
      effect. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus
      NCFM (L-NCFM) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 (B-LBi07) in nonconstipation FBDs.
      METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial of the probiotic
      bacterias L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day (2x10(11) CFU/d) versus placebo over 8
      weeks. Primary endpoints were global relief of gastrointestinal symptoms and
      satisfaction with treatment. Secondary endpoints were change in symptoms
      severity, well-being, and quality of life. Microbiological effect was assessed by
      quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction on fecal samples. RESULTS: Sixty
      patients (probiotic, n=31; placebo, n=29), 72% females, 84% whites, mean age 37
      years. Abdominal bloating improved in the probiotics compared with the placebo
      group at 4 weeks (4.10 vs 6.17, P=0.009; change in bloating severity P=0.02) and 
      8 weeks (4.26 vs 5.84, P=0.06; change in bloating severity P<0.01). Analyses on
      the irritable bowel syndrome subgroup (n=33) showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS:
      L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day improve symptoms of bloating in patients with
      FBDs. These data supports the role of intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology 
      of FBD and the role for probiotic bacteria in the management of these disorders.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 significantly
      alleviates irritable bowel syndrome and improves quality of life--a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1123-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04633.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that an imbalance of the intestinal
      microbiota and a dysfunctional intestinal barrier might trigger irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). As probiotics have been reported to restore the intestinal
      microbiota and the gut barrier, the therapeutic potential of probiotics within
      IBS became of strong interest. AIM: To assess the efficacy of Bifidobacterium
      bifidum MIMBb75 in IBS. METHODS: A total of 122 patients were randomised to
      receive either placebo (N=62) or MIMBb75 (N=60) once a day for 4 weeks. The
      severity of IBS symptoms was recorded daily on a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS:
      MIMBb75 significantly reduced the global assessment of IBS symptoms by -0.88
      points (95% CI: -1.07; -0.69) when compared with only -0.16 (95% CI: -0.32; 0.00)
      points in the placebo group (P<0.0001). MIMBb75 also significantly improved the
      IBS symptoms pain/discomfort, distension/bloating, urgency and digestive
      disorder. The evaluation of the SF12 sum scores showed a significant gain in
      quality of life within the bifidobacteria group. Furthermore, adequate relief was
      reported by 47% of the patients in the bifidobacteria and only by 11% of the
      patients in the placebo group (P<0.0001). Overall responder rates were 57% in the
      bifidobacteria group but only 21% in the placebo group (P=0.0001). MIMBb75 was
      well tolerated and adverse events were not different from placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 effectively alleviates global IBS and improves
      IBS symptoms simultaneously with an improvement of quality of life. Considering
      the high efficacy of MIMBb75 in IBS along with the good side-effect profile,
      MIMBb75 is a promising candidate for IBS therapy.

AB  - Traditional symptom-based therapies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are
      directed at the relief of individual IBS symptoms, but they are often of limited 
      efficacy in addressing the entire symptom complex. Combinations of drugs to
      target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic
      treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms
      of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches.
      Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the
      modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving
      symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber,
      bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the
      improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents
      for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain
      and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and
      5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and
      individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short
      term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms,
      particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear
      to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2
      chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS
      symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Both tricyclic
      antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are equally effective
      in relieving global IBS symptoms, and have some benefits in treating abdominal
      pain. Certain types of psychologic therapy may be effective in improving global
      symptoms in some IBS patients. Further studies are strongly needed to develop
      better treatment strategies for Korean patients with IBS.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal condition,
      affecting 10% to 20% of adults in developed countries. Over the last few years,
      growing evidence has supported a new hypothesis for IBS based on alterations in
      intestinal bacterial composition. This article reviews the evidence for a
      bacterial concept in IBS and begins to formulate a hypothesis of how these
      bacterial systems could integrate in a new pathophysiologic mechanism in the
      development of IBS. Data suggesting an interaction between this gut flora and
      inflammation in the context of IBS is also presented.

AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common disorders in
      gastroenterological practice with a prevalence of approx. 12 % in Germany, and it
      is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, altered stool frequency and
      consistency, and meteorism and bloating. There is currently no agreement between 
      those seeing patients with IBS (general practitioner, gastroenterologist,
      psychosomatics) on the criteria for clinical diagnosis. Metaanalyses of treatment
      studies in IBS have shown that probiotics have a high clinical efficacy in IBS,
      especially since development of novel pharmaceutical compounds have not reached
      the market or have been withdrawn. In addition to the actual status of probiotic 
      efficacy in IBS studies conducted worldwide, we present 3 German clinical studies
      with probiotic E.COLI preparations that have proven their efficacy in IBS in
      adults and in children.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of saccharomyces
      boulardii in irritable bowel syndrome: effect on quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics confer health benefits to the host. However, its clinical 
      effect on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial. AIMS: This study was
      aimed to evaluate the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii on quality of life (QOL)
      and symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS or mixed-type IBS.
      METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with IBS were randomized either to receive S.
      boulardii at 2x10 live cells as a daily dose (n=34), or placebo (n=33) for 4
      weeks. IBS-QOL was assessed at the beginning and end of the treatment phase.
      IBS-related symptoms, bowel movement frequency, and stool consistency were
      recorded on a daily basis and assessed each week. RESULTS: The overall
      improvement in IBS-QOL was higher in S. boulardii group than placebo (15.4% vs
      7.0%; P<0.05). All eight domains of IBS-QOL were significantly improved in S.
      boulardii group; however, placebo group only showed improvements in dysphoria and
      health worry. Composite scores for IBS symptoms were significantly reduced in
      both groups to a similar extent. Bowel frequency and stool consistency did not
      change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: S. boulardii improved IBS-QOL better than
      placebo but was not superior for individual symptoms in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS or mixed-type IBS.

TI  - Health benefits of probiotics: are mixtures more effective than single strains?
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s00394-010-0166-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes
      incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of
      probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures 
      are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more
      or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: 
      Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including
      irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune
      function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation,
      inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.
      However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its
      component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more
      effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide
      range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain
      probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains
      that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to
      synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic
      dose used in some studies is at present unclear.
