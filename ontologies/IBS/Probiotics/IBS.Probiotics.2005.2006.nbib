TI  - [Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 2077-80
AB  - Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a subgroup of IBS. Patients with
      an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis may have a 12-fold increased risk of
      developing IBS symptoms within the same year. The IBS can be manifested in each
      of its clinical types, but the diarrhea-predominant form occurs most commonly.
      The primary pathophysiologic factor in developing IBS after enteral infection may
      be defects in enteric nervous system which can produce abnormality in visceral
      hypersensitivity and intestinal motility. These patients also display exaggerated
      increases in mucosal immunocompetent T lymphocytes and an abnormally high pro-
      versus anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio, providing evidence to the contribution
      of the immune system in the development of postinfectious IBS. Via bi-directional
      brain-gut interactions both peripheral and central events can play a role in the 
      development of clinical symptoms. Stress is associated with significant worsening
      of the complaints in IBS and may also result in a shift in the host-gut microbial
      relationship. IBS itself may predispose patients to acute bacterial
      gastroenteritis because of the altered intestinal motility. It needs further
      clarifying the relationship between IBS and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      syndrome. Upon the data so far the altered intestinal flora in IBS would merely
      reflect developments due to altered motility and not a causal relationship. The
      treatment of postinfectious IBS does not differ principally from that of the
      idiopathic IBS. Antibiotics or probiotics may lead to temporary symptomatic
      improvement, but, given the lack of evidence based data, they cannot be advised
      for routine use so far.

AB  - This brief review appraises the current evidence of the efficacy of probiotics,
      including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and VSL#3, in the treatment of irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms potentially important will be evaluated,
      with specific reference to immune function, effects on motility and intraluminal 
      milieu. These experimental and clinical observations suggest that probiotics may 
      play a role in the management of IBS.

TI  - Are probiotics effective in the treatment of fungal colonization of the
      gastrointestinal tract? Experimental and clinical studies.
PG  - 35-49
AB  - UNLABELLED: The influence of fungal colonization and probiotic treatment on the
      course of gastric ulcer (GU) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was not explored. Our
      studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and
      ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60
      patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group.
      Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated.
      Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative
      examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included
      estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI
      tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without
      probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically
      (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area,
      gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines
      IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative
      examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical
      studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and
      patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing 
      and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of 
      animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower
      than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of
      TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all 
      rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in
      92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and
      inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic 
      therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal
      colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the
      duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is
      associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).

PG  - 5-12
AB  - Probiotics discussed in this paper are evaluated using the WHO/FAO definition
      from 2001. The authors present a brief description of the normal microbiota of
      the gastrointestinal tract, discuss probiotics in the aspects of gut immunity and
      then move to selection of bacterial strains as probiotics. The main issue raised 
      is the critical evaluation of probiotics in randomized clinical trials for
      conditions such as: infectious diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea;
      inflammatory bowel disease; pouchitis and diverticulitis; H. pylori infection;
      irritable bowel syndrome. Safety of probiotics is mentioned with respect to
      susceptible individuals and bacterial translocation. As a conclusion the authors 
      again recall the strain specific actions of probiotics in different clinical
      situations and that so far probiotics play a role in rotaviral and post
      antibiotic diarrhoea and pouchitis. An important issue still to be solved in
      order to confidently recommend probiotics as efficacious therapy is the
      regulatory aspect of probiotics.

TI  - Treating irritable bowel syndrome with a food elimination diet followed by food
      challenge and probiotics.
PG  - 514-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the gut-associated immune system may be
      up-regulated resulting in immune complex production, low-grade inflammation, loss
      of Class I bacteria, and translocation of inflammatory mediators and
      macromolecules outside of the GI lumen. Since food intolerance may be one of the 
      reasons for this upregulation, our goal was to investigate the role of food
      intolerance in IBS patients. METHODS: In this open label pilot study, we enrolled
      20 patients with IBS by Rome II criteria (15 women, ages 24-81) who had failed
      standard medical therapies in a tertiary care GI clinic. Baseline serum IgE and
      IgG food and mold panels, and comprehensive stool analysis (CSA) were performed. 
      Breath-hydrogen testing and IBS Quality-of-Life (QOL) questionnaires were
      obtained. Patients underwent food elimination diets based on the results of food 
      and mold panels followed by controlled food challenge. Probiotics were also
      introduced. Repeat testing was performed at 6-months. We followed up with this
      cohort at 1 year after trial completion to assess the reported intervention and
      for placebo effect. RESULTS: Baseline abnormalities were identified on serum IgG 
      food and mold panels in 100% of the study subjects with significant improvement
      after food elimination and rotation diet (p < 0.05). Significant improvements
      were seen in stool frequency (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and IBS-QOL scores (p <
      0.0001). Imbalances of beneficial flora and dysbiotic flora were identified in
      100% of subjects by CSA. There was a trend to improvement of beneficial flora
      after treatment but no change in dysbiotic flora. The 1-year follow up
      demonstrated significant continued adherence to the food rotation diet (4.00 +/- 
      1.45), minimal symptomatic problems with IBS (4.00 +/- 1.17), and perception of
      control over IBS (4.15 +/- 1.23). The continued use of probiotics was considered 
      less helpful (3.40 +/- 1.60). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that identifying
      and appropriately addressing food sensitivity in IBS patients not previously
      responding to standard therapy results in a sustained clinical response and
      impacts on overall well being and quality of life in this challenging entity.

TI  - Role of gut microflora and probiotic effects in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though the cause of irritable bowel sindrome (IBS) is not yet
      known, alterations of the intestinal microflora may be important in its
      pathogenesis. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of rifaximine alone or in association
      with the probiotic strain of Bifidobacterium longum W11 in reducing symptoms in
      patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a monocentric, prospective, randomized
      open trial including 70 patients randomized in to two groups: Group A (41
      patients) receiving rifaximin 200 (2 cp bid for ten days in a month) followed by 
      a formulation of the probiotic strain of Bifidobacterium longum W11(one
      granulated suspension for 6 days on alternate weeks ) and Group B (29 patients)
      receiving only rifaximin 200 (2 cp bid for ten days in a month). The clinical
      evaluation was performed at admission and after 2-months, taking into account the
      method of visual analogous. RESULTS: At the 2-month follow-up, Group A patients
      reported a greater improvement of symptoms compared to patients in group B (p =
      0.010) even if the physician's opinion at T1 did not confirm these results (p =
      0.07). CONCLUSION: The increased colonisation by Bifi-dobacterium longum W11,
      after the cyclic administration of rifaximin, which eradicates the bacterial
      overgrowth of the small intestine, may reduce symptoms, especially those related 
      to bowel habit and stool frequency in patients with IBS. The abnormalities
      observed in the colonic flora of IBS suggest, in fact, that a probiotic approach 
      will ultimately be justified.

TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus modulates intestinal pain and induces opioid and
      cannabinoid receptors.
PG  - 35-7
AB  - Abdominal pain is common in the general population and, in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome, is attributed to visceral hypersensitivity. We found
      that oral administration of specific Lactobacillus strains induced the expression
      of mu-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells, and
      mediated analgesic functions in the gut-similar to the effects of morphine. These
      results suggest that the microbiology of the intestinal tract influences our
      visceral perception, and suggest new approaches for the treatment of abdominal
      pain and irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of live combined Bifidobacterium, 
      Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
      METHODS: Eighty-five patients [male 32, female 53; age (45.31+/-11.72) years]
      were given live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules
      1260 mg/d t.i.d.x4 weeks. Syndrome scales were used to evaluate the efficacy in
      gastrointestinal syndrome. Fecal flora was also measured before and after the
      treatment. Six bacteria were cultured and the colony forming units were counted
      in stool. SPSS was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients
      finished the follow-up. No side-effect was found. For treatment of irritable
      bowel syndrome, the effective rate of live combined Bifidobacterium,
      Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules was 56.8% in the second week, 74.3% in
      the fourth week and 73.0% in the sixth week. Single symptom was improved,
      especially in abdominal pain and stool character. The probiotica containing live 
      combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus could increase
      bifidobacterium count (P<0.01) and lactobacillus count (P<0.05); decrease
      bacteroides count (P<0.05) and enterococci count (P<0.01); No obvious changes
      were observed in clostridium difficile colonitis and enterobacteriaceae (P>0.05).
      CONCLUSION: The result of the study indicated that the administration of live
      combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus improved the symptom of 
      irritable bowel syndrome and that there was a gradual increase of this effect.
      Thereafter conditions remained stable for 2 weeks. That improvement may be
      associated with alterations in gastrointestinal flora.

TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. A case control experience.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - AIM: As optimal therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains elusive,
      current approach to therapy is based on symptomatic treatment. With this
      case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS
      patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, 
      angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and
      probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus
      thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 
      women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean
      period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men
      and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their
      customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the
      presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and
      alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values,
      the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55%
      (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in 
      diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared
      with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was
      found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups
      showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was
      statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension
      (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a 
      significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of 
      bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term
      benefit of the study product.

TI  - Effect of a symbiotic preparation on the clinical manifestations of irritable
      bowel syndrome, constipation-variant. Results of an open, uncontrolled
      multicenter study.
PG  - 349-58
AB  - AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently associated with an imbalance in
      intestinal bacteria. To date, few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety 
      of probiotic administration in patients with constipation-variant IBS. A new
      agent recently available in clinical practice is a symbiotic consisting of a
      probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum W11, and the short chain oligosaccharide
      prebiotic Fos Actilight. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of this symbiotic in patients with constipation-variant IBS. METHODS: A
      total of 636 patients (250 men, 386 women) diagnosed with constipation-type IBS
      according to the Roma II criteria were enrolled in 43 centers and received the
      symbiotic at a dose of 3 g/die for at least 36 days. A validated questionnaire
      investigating symptoms and stool frequency was administered before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: Based on patient responses to visual scale items, frequency
      increased significantly after treatment in the ''no symptom'' class from 3% to
      26.7% for bloating and from 8.4% to 44.1% for abdominal pain (P<0.0001). In the
      more severe symptoms classes (moderate-severe), symptom frequency dropped
      significantly from 62.9% to 9.6% and from 38.8% to 4.1% for bloating and
      abdominal pain, respectively. Stool frequency significantly increased from
      2.9+/-1.6 times/week to 4.1+/-1.6 times/ week. CONCLUSIONS: The study product can
      increase stool frequency in patients with constipation-variant IBS and reduce
      abdominal pain and bloating in those with moderate-severe symptoms.

TI  - Clinical studies on alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 576-80
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common diagnoses in
      gastroenterology, but current therapies are inefficient. Recent clinical trials
      suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in IBS. Because of the
      heterogeneity of IBS a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single 
      strain. We screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic
      combination consisting of L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, P. freudenreichii 
      ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The clinical efficacy of the
      probiotic combination was evaluated in IBS patients in a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. During six months the
      subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. IBS symptoms
      were followed by symptom diaries. The probiotic supplementation demonstrated
      significant value in reducing IBS symptoms. At the end of the study period the
      total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had
      reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory
      effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the
      probiotic. The probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the
      combination that each strain alone would not hold. In conclusion, we found a
      probiotic combination of LGG and three other strains to be effective in
      alleviating IBS symptoms.

TI  - Intestinal colonisation, microbiota and future probiotics?
PG  - 558-62
AB  - The human intestine is colonized by a large number of microorganisms,
      collectively termed microbiota, which support a variety of physiological
      functions. As the major part of the microbiota has not yet been cultured,
      molecular methods are required to determine microbial composition and the impact 
      of specific dietary components including probiotics. Probiotics are viable
      microbial food supplements, which have a beneficial impact on human health.
      Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic
      products. The most significant demonstrations for probiotic efficacy include
      prevention and treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea
      and allergy prevention. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (=ATCC 53103) and
      Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 are the among the best-characterized and most studied
      probiotic strains with demonstrated impact on human health. New complex targets
      for probiotics include irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori
      infection. For future probiotics the most important target is a demonstrated
      clinical benefit supported by knowledge on the mechanistic actions in the
      microbiota of the target population. Molecular and genomics-based knowledge of
      the composition and functions of the microbiota, as well as deviations from the
      balanced microbiota, will advance the selection of new and specific probiotics.
      Potential combinations of specific probiotics may prove to be the next step to
      reduce the risk on intestinal diseases and reconstruct specific microbial
      deviations.

TI  - Bacterial overgrowth as a cause of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 669-73
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recently published studies investigating any
      association between gut flora and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Experimental studies demonstrate associations between gut flora, gut
      motility, mucosal inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Scientific bases
      for possible benefits of selected probiotics on irritable bowel symptoms have
      been identified. Disturbances in viable counts of fecal flora have been
      demonstrated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Results of studies based 
      on breath tests are conflicting as to whether the prevalence of small intestinal 
      bacterial overgrowth is increased in this group. Nonetheless, a longitudinal
      analysis based on bacteriological assessments of serial small intestinal
      aspirates suggests that this entity should be considered in patients with
      irritable bowel symptoms, especially in the setting of predisposition to
      bacterial overgrowth. Clinical trials of probiotic treatment for irritable bowel 
      syndrome have yielded conflicting results. SUMMARY: Recent studies provide
      increasing support for the concept that disturbances in gut flora occur in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and that such abnormalities may contribute
      to irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms. The relative importance of disturbed
      gut flora to symptom pathogenesis, along with the therapeutic potential of
      modulation of the gut flora for amelioration of irritable bowel syndrome
      symptoms, however, remains to be fully defined.

TI  - Probiotics as functional food in the treatment of diarrhea.
PG  - 717-21
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A disturbance in microbial balance of the gastrointestinal
      tract is often associated with diarrhea. Therefore, probiotics, as beneficial
      microorganisms for host health, have attracted clinical attention for their
      potential therapeutic application in the treatment of diarrhea. This review
      focuses on new research findings relevant to the effects of probiotics on
      diarrhea prevention and treatment and potential mechanisms of action for this
      alternative therapy for diarrhea. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials suggest
      potential beneficial effects of probiotic therapy for preventing and treating
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute diarrhea including rotavirus-induced
      diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
      The most extensively studied probiotics for diarrhea are Lactobacillus,
      Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces, with potential mechanisms of therapeutic
      action based on the protection of intestinal epithelial cell and barrier
      function, prevention of enterotoxin binding to intestinal epithelial cells, and
      regulation of intestinal microbial environment. SUMMARY: Growing evidence
      suggests that probiotics may serve as a functional food in the treatment of
      diarrhea. Remaining challenges include identifying mechanisms of action to
      provide the basis of more refined hypothesis-driven clinical trials. The correct 
      combination and concentration of probiotics applied to the appropriate
      gastrointestinal disorders may improve the efficacy of this approach for diarrhea
      and other diseases.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children.
PG  - 550-7
AB  - Probiotics are marketed in several countries and widely used by pediatric health 
      care providers. Although probiotics can be helpful for specific disorders, they
      have been broadly prescribed for disorders without clear evidence to support
      their use. Furthermore, in certain specific conditions, probiotics cause clinical
      deterioration. This report is a review and evaluation of the evidence or lack
      thereof to support a beneficial effect of probiotic agents in a variety of
      pediatric conditions and to review the safety and potential adverse events that
      may be encountered when using probiotics. It is also important to emphasize that 
      probiotics are highly heterogeneous with differences in composition, biological
      activity, and dose among the different probiotic preparations.

TI  - Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, 
      or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore
      expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics,
      whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to
      incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for 
      prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the
      Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large 
      intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer,
      focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language.
      Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or
      meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose,
      galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large
      bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These
      carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and
      intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small.
      Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few,
      although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel
      disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early
      days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial
      balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.

TI  - [Probiotic drug therapy with E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN): results of a
      prospective study of the records of 3,807 patients].
PG  - 651-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Living microorganisms that enter the gut in an active state and
      exert a positive influence on the host are called probiotics. Numerous
      experimental and clinical studies were performed recently and confirm both the
      efficacy and modes of action of probiotic drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a
      post-marketing-surveillance study with the probiotic Escherichia Coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) data on the range of indications as well as on efficacy and
      tolerance were gathered prospectively in 446 centres. The intended treatment
      duration was limited to a maximum of 12 weeks. RESULTS: EcN was used in 3,807
      patients with more than 20 different indications, n = 3,511 of whom had
      gastrointestinal complaints: Among others, 1,067 patients presented with
      chronically recurring (n = 728) or protracted diarrhoea (n = 339), 415 with
      inflammatory bowel disease, 679 with irritable bowel syndrome, and 253 with
      chronic constipation. The overall efficacy was assessed as good to very good by
      an average of 81.4 % of the therapists. The stool frequency and consistency as
      well as the symptoms of meteorism and abdominal pain were improved in very many
      patients. Suspected cases of side effects were documented in only 2.8 % of the
      patients. CONCLUSION: EcN is frequently used in practice for the treatment of
      various, mostly gastrointestinal, complaints and is well tolerated.

AB  - While the precise pathophysiology of IBS remains to be elucidated, dysmotility
      and altered visceral perception/sensation are currently the most popular
      hypotheses. More recently, roles for enteric infection and intestinal
      inflammation have been proposed. Probiotics, defined as live or attenuated
      bacteria or bacterial products that confer a significant health benefit to the
      host, have the potential to provide a clinical tool to explore these
      interactions. We reviewed the effects of probiotics on IBS symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of an encapsulated probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 in women
      with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1581-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria exhibit a variety of properties, including
      immunomodulatory activity, which are unique to a particular strain. Thus, not all
      species will necessarily have the same therapeutic potential in a particular
      condition. We have preliminary evidence that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 may
      have utility in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was
      designed to confirm the efficacy of the probiotic bacteria B. infantis 35624 in a
      large-scale, multicenter, clinical trial of women with IBS. A second objective of
      the study was to determine the optimal dosage of probiotic for administration in 
      an encapsulated formulation. METHODS: After a 2-wk baseline, 362 primary care IBS
      patients, with any bowel habit subtype, were randomized to either placebo or
      freeze-dried, encapsulated B. infantis at a dose of 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(8), or 1 x 
      10(10), cfu/mL for 4 wk. IBS symptoms were monitored daily and scored on to a
      6-point Likert scale with the primary outcome variable being abdominal pain or
      discomfort. A composite symptom score, the subject's global assessment of IBS
      symptom relief, and measures of quality of life (using the IBS-QOL instrument)
      were also recorded. RESULTS: B. infantis 35624 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) cfu was
      significantly superior to placebo and all other bifidobacterium doses for the
      primary efficacy variable of abdominal pain as well as the composite score and
      scores for bloating, bowel dysfunction, incomplete evacuation, straining, and the
      passage of gas at the end of the 4-wk study. The improvement in global symptom
      assessment exceeded placebo by more than 20% (p < 0.02). Two other doses of
      probiotic (1 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(10)) were not significantly different from
      placebo; of these, the 1 x 10(10) dose was associated with significant
      formulation problems. No significant adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS:
      B. infantis 35624 is a probiotic that specifically relieves many of the symptoms 
      of IBS. At a dosage level of 1 x 10(8) cfu, it can be delivered by a capsule
      making it stable, convenient to administer, and amenable to widespread use. The
      lack of benefits observed with the other dosage levels of the probiotic highlight
      the need for clinical data in the final dosage form and dose of probiotic before 
      these products should be used in practice.

PG  - 321-6
AB  - Over the past several years, a number of studies have addressed the role of
      specific strains of bacteria, or combinations thereof, to alleviate certain
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). More importantly, the precise factors
      that contribute to this therapeutic effect, such as modulations in cytokine
      levels and alterations in colonic motility, are being clarified. This review
      serves to summarize the evidence for the use of probiotics in the treatment of
      IBS and to place this information in clinical context. Potential future
      developments and areas of possible research are also discussed.

PG  - 403-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the best program for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS) of constipation type. METHODS: Ninety-five cases of IBS were randomly
      divided into 3 groups. Group A (n = 30) were treated by acupuncture combined with
      microorganism pharmaceutical preparations, group B (n = 35) by oral
      administration of medicine for loosening the bowel to relieve constipation plus
      microorganism pharmaceutical preparations, and group C (n = 30) by simple
      acupuncture. RESULTS: The total effective rates were 90.0%, 77.2% and 66.7%, in
      the group A, B and C, respectively, with a very significant differences as the
      group A compared with those in the groups B, C (P < 0.01), and with no
      significant difference as the group B compared with that of the group C (P > 0.
      05). The intestinal available bacteria, bilidobacteria and lactobacillus,
      increased and enteric bacilli decreased in varying degrees in the 3 groups.
      CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with microorganism pharmaceutical preparations
      has a better therapeutic effect on irritable bowel syndrome of constipation type.

TI  - [The effects of probiotics on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 413-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal 
      (GI) tract disorder that has heterogeneous clinical presentations such as
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distension. It is known
      that several mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Probiotics may
      target one or more pathophysiologic pathways in IBS and may improve the symptoms 
      of IBS. However, the results of studies about probiotics on IBS are
      controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      probiotics on GI symptoms and intestinal gas volume changes in patients with IBS.
      METHODS: Forty patients were randomly allocated to be treated with Medilac DS
      (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecium) (n=20) or placebo (n=20) in a
      double-blind, prospective manner. The change in intestinal gas volume and symptom
      scores after 4-week treatment were evaluated for the efficacy. RESULTS: There was
      no significant difference in bloating, frequency of gas expulsion, frequency of
      defecation, and hardness of stool before and after the treatment. However, the
      severity of abdominal pain and the frequency of abdominal pain decreased
      significantly in Medilac DS group (2.4+/-1.3 cm/day --> 1.6+/-1.6 cm/day,
      1.7+/-1.3/day --> 1.0+/-1.0/day) (p=0.044, p=0.038), but not in placebo group
      (2.1+/-2.0 cm/day --> 1.8+/-2.1 cm/day, 1.3+/-1.2/day --> 1.4+/-1.9/day). In both
      groups, intestinal gas volume at baseline, after 2-week treatment, and after
      4-week treatment did not show significant change. Medilac DS was well tolerated
      without adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Medilac DS is a safe and useful probiotic
      agent for the treatment of abdominal pain in patients with IBS.

TI  - Probiotics and their potential health claims.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - Many studies have attempted to identify specific positive health effects of
      probiotics. One of the challenges in generalizing health effects of probiotics is
      that different strains exert disparate effects on human health. As a result, the 
      efficacy of one strain or species cannot necessarily be inferred from another.
      The objective of this review is to examine the current scientific literature that
      could be used as the basis for potential health claims. More specifically, this
      paper will review existing evidence of different probiotic strains to prevent and
      treat diarrhea, treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treat inflammatory bowel
      disease, and prevent colon cancer. The strongest evidence is related to the use
      of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the prevention and treatment of
      rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Further examination of the literature also shows
      promise in the treatment of some forms of IBS with probiotics. Future studies
      that use consistent supplementation regimes will allow more definitive
      conclusions to be drawn on the effects of probiotics on IBS, inflammatory bowel
      disease, and colon cancer.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: recent and novel therapeutic approaches.
PG  - 1073-88
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal 
      disorder affecting up to 3-15% of the general population in Western countries. It
      is characterised by unexplained abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating in
      association with altered bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered
      to be multifactorial, involving disturbances of the brain-gut-axis: IBS has been 
      associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor functions, visceral
      hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, autonomic dysfunction and mucosal
      inflammation. Traditional IBS therapy is mainly symptom oriented and often
      unsatisfactory. Hence, there is a need for new treatment strategies. Increasing
      knowledge of brain-gut physiology, mechanisms, and neurotransmitters and
      receptors involved in gastrointestinal motor and sensory function have led to the
      development of several new therapeutic approaches. This article provides a
      systematic overview of recently approved or novel medications that show promise
      for the treatment of IBS; classification is based on the physiological systems
      targeted by the medication. The article includes agents acting on the serotonin
      receptor or serotonin transporter system, novel selective anticholinergics,
      alpha-adrenergic agonists, opioid agents, cholecystokinin antagonists, neurokinin
      antagonists, somatostatin receptor agonists, neurotrophin-3, corticotropin
      releasing factor antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase-c
      agonists, melatonin and atypical benzodiazepines. Finally, the role of probiotics
      and antibacterials in the treatment of IBS is summarised.

TI  - Nutritional care of the patient with constipation.
PG  - 575-87
AB  - Chronic constipation is defined as a symptom-based disorder based on the presence
      for at least 3 months in the last year of unsatisfactory defecation characterized
      by infrequent stools, difficult stool passage, or both. On the other hand, the
      presence of clinically important abdominal discomfort or pain associated with
      constipation defines irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation. Intake of 
      dietary fibre and bulking agents (psyllium) may be effective in alleviating
      chronic constipation in patients without slow colonic transit or disordered
      constipation. On the other hand, fibre may improve stool consistency in patients 
      with IBS with constipation, but it is considered to be not effective in improving
      abdominal pain, distension or bloating. Probiotics may be effective in relieving 
      constipation; however, the effect of lactic acid bacteria ingestion may be
      dependent on the bacterial strain used and the population being studied.
      Lactulose, which is a substrate for lactic acid bacteria (prebiotic), is
      effective to treat patients with chronic constipation.

TI  - Current and future developments in travelers' diarrhea therapy.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - Diarrhea continues to be the leading health problem among international travelers
      to developing tropical and semi-tropical regions. Despite more than 50 years of
      research providing information about the etiology and pathogenesis of the
      disease, the rate of illness and consequences remain unchanged. An estimated 40% 
      of travelers to developing nations will become ill with diarrhea. Although
      travelers' diarrhea is considered a self-limited disease, novel and effective
      approaches to disease prevention and treatment have been realized in recent
      years. Also, recent evidence has identified a potential for long-term
      complications of the illness, including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. 
      With the advent of poorly absorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin, a treatment option for the 
      common watery diarrhea syndrome equivalent to previously used absorbed
      antibacterial drugs has emerged. Rifaximin with an excellent safety profile and
      limited potential to induce coliform resistance, prevents most of the diarrhea
      that would otherwise occur. With further studies in different settings, new
      consideration should be given to the routine use of chemoprophylaxis for
      travelers to high-risk countries. Antibacterial drugs will continue to be the
      optimal treatment for travelers' diarrhea subjects for the most part caused by
      bacterial enteropathogens and shorten the duration of diarrhea by 1-2 days
      compared with no active drug treatment.

TI  - Probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases in children: hard and not-so-hard
      evidence of efficacy.
PG  - 454-75
AB  - The use of probiotics, once discussed primarily in the context of alternative
      medicine, is now entering mainstream medicine. However, only a few of the
      potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in
      well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially 
      true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on
      efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric
      age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult
      studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied
      in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered
      well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal
      illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, 
      only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects 
      of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be
      generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of
      exciting promises and many unanswered questions.

TI  - Measuring successful treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: is "satisfactory
      relief " enough?
PG  - 1066-8
AB  - The treatment options for the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are expanding as new
      therapies, including probiotics and serotonin receptor agents, become available. 
      Before any new agents gain widespread use, they must be studied in appropriately 
      designed clinical trials. Symptom improvement remains the key clinically but the 
      best technique to measure symptom improvement is unclear. Many IBS therapy
      studies have used a binary endpoint such as "Have you had satisfactory relief of 
      your IBS symptoms in the past week? Yes/No?" The study by Whitehead and
      colleagues in this issue suggests that "satisfactory relief" is affected by
      baseline symptom severity and may not always truly reflect the symptom burden.
      Future research needs to determine whether "satisfactory relief" is truly
      adequate, or whether alternatives such as the proportion of patients achieving a 
      > or = 50% reduction in symptom severity would represent a superior approach to
      capture clinically important improvement.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or 
      in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful
      in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the
      prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the
      maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results
      indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent 
      atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say
      they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend
      probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention
      of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger
      and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative
      and dose-ranging trials.

TI  - Probiotics and chronic disease.
PG  - 270-4
AB  - In today's climate, changed lifestyles and the increased use of antibiotics are
      significant factors that affect the preservation of a healthy intestinal
      microflora. The concept of probiotics is to restore and maintain a microflora
      advantageous to the human body. Probiotics are found in a number of fermented
      dairy products, infant formula, and dietary supplements. Basic research on
      probiotics has suggested several modes of action beneficial for the human body
      and clinical research has proven its preventive and curative features in
      different intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Chronic diseases cause
      considerable disablement in patients and represent a substantial economic burden 
      on healthcare resources. Research has demonstrated a crucial role of nutrition in
      the prevention of chronic disease. Thus, positive, strain-specific effects of
      probiotics have been shown in diarrheal diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, and in
      atopic diseases and in the prevention of cancer. As the majority of probiotics
      naturally inhabit the human intestinal microflora, their use has been regarded as
      very safe. However, in view of the range of potential benefits on health that
      might be achieved by the use of some probiotic bacteria, major and thorough
      evaluation is still necessary. In conclusion, probiotics act as an adjuvant in
      the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of chronic diseases.

TI  - Probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome: rationale, putative mechanisms, and
      evidence of clinical efficacy.
PG  - 264-9
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) follows an acute, presumably infectious
      diarrheal illness in approximately 15% of patients. There may be a persistent,
      mild inflammatory state with changes in mucosal function or structure. Changes in
      the colonic bacterial flora reported in IBS seem related to predominant bowel.
      Colonic bacteria normally metabolize nutrients with the formation of gas and
      short chain fatty acids. The latter may induce propulsive contractions and
      accelerate colonic transit or they may enhance fluid and sodium absorption in the
      colon. This review addresses the mechanisms, rationale and current evidence for
      the efficacy of probiotics, including Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and VSL#3, in
      the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms influenced by probiotics include immune
      function, motility, and the intraluminal milieu. Probiotics may suppress the
      low-grade inflammation associated with IBS or restore normal local immune
      function. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria subspecies are able to deconjugate and 
      absorb bile acids, potentially reducing the colonic mucosal secretion of mucin
      and fluids that may contribute to functional diarrhea or IBS with diarrhea.
      Therapeutic trials show the potential benefit of Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli
      species alone or in the specific probiotic combination, VSL#3, on symptoms in
      IBS. Colonic transit was retarded in IBS patients treated with VSL#3 without
      induction of significant changes in bowel function. In summary, probiotics are
      promising therapies in IBS.

TI  - Probiotics: their role in the treatment and prevention of disease.
PG  - 261-75
AB  - A probiotic is a "live microbial food ingredients that, when ingested in
      sufficient quantities, exerts health benefits on the consumer". Probiotics exert 
      their benefits through several mechanisms; they prevent colonization, cellular
      adhesion and invasion by pathogenic organisms, they have direct antimicrobial
      activity and they modulate the host immune response. The strongest evidence for
      the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in their use for the prevention
      of symptoms of lactose intolerance, treatment of acute diarrhea, attenuation of
      antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal side effects and the prevention and
      treatment of allergy manifestations. More research needs to be carried out to
      clarify conflicting findings on the use of probiotics for prevention of
      travelers' diarrhea, infections in children in daycare and dental caries, and
      elimination of nasal colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria. Promising
      ongoing research is being conducted on the use of probiotics for the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile colitis, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection,
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and prevention of relapse, treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome, treatment of intestinal inflammation in cystic fibrosis
      patients, and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
      Finally, areas of future research include the use of probiotics for the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis, prevention of cancer and the treatment of
      graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients.

TI  - Small intestine bacterial overgrowth in irritable bowel syndrome: a retrospective
      study with rifaximin.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent diagnosis in gastroenterology, 
      but it is now clear that an altered dynamic equilibrium and bacterial overgrowth 
      in the small intestine may mimic an IBS-like syndrome. METHODS: We have,
      therefore, evaluated the real prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      (SIBO) by retrospectively examining the glucose hydrogen (H(2)) breath test in 96
      patients with a previous symptoms-based IBS diagnosis. Moreover, we wished to
      evaluate the efficacy of the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in eradicating a
      SIBO syndrome. RESULTS: The breath test showed a SIBO syndrome in 44 out 96 IBS
      patients (45.8%), who had H(2) peaks in the expired air higher than 10 ppm over
      the baseline value (mean: 36.2+/-18.7 ppm). All these patients were treated with 
      rifaximin (1 200 mg/day for 14 days) followed by a twenty-day cycle of
      probiotics. Twenty-three of them returned to a control visit within 4-5 months:
      the glucose breath test became negative in 19 cases (82.6%; P<0.01) and mean peak
      value of H(2) significantly decreased from 40.9+/-20.4 to 4.78+/-8.42 ppm
      (P<0.001). Patients reported also a substantial improvement of the IBS symptoms. 
      No adverse effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a SIBO syndrome 
      is present in about half of patients with an IBS diagnosis and, therefore, it
      should always be suspected in these patients. Moreover, the use of broad-spectrum
      non absorbable antibiotics, such as rifaximin, represents a safe and effective
      approach to SIBO with a low risk of causing microbial resistance.

AB  - Probiotic agents are live microbes or components of microbes that have a positive
      effect on the host. They exert their action through interplay with the immune
      system of the host. Some of this effect is local and some is systemic. The full
      story is yet to be discovered. Probiotics have a definite positive effect on
      rotavirus diarrhea, post antibiotic diarrhea and pouchitis. Their exact role in
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, other forms of infectious
      diarrhea, and prevention of cancer is yet to be determined. This review
      summarizes the data about probiotics in these conditions.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: new and emerging therapies.
PG  - 128-35
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome refers to abdominal discomfort
      associated with altered bowel habits. Recent evidence suggests that the primary
      pathophysiologic mechanism is brain-gut dysregulation. Many central and
      peripheral factors are involved. This article will review important
      pathophysiologic mechanisms with a focus on new and emerging therapies. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Prior gastroenteritis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may be 
      important for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding of
      serotonergic receptors in gastrointestinal function has led to the development of
      serotonergic agents such as alosetron and tegaserod. Novel agents targeting other
      receptor sites include neurokinin and neurohormonal modulators, chloride channels
      and opioid receptors. Other therapeutic approaches - behavioral treatments,
      probiotics, antibiotics and alternative therapies - have developing roles in the 
      treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. SUMMARY: A better understanding of
      pathophysiologic mechanisms has resulted in therapeutic advances. Prokinetic
      therapies may have a role in nondiarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
      Antidepressants are used to modulate pain and treat comorbid psychological
      distress. Newer agents target various receptor sites. Advances in
      psychological/behavioral treatments and alternative modalities hold promise for
      the future.

TI  - Systematic review: Complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel 
      syndrome.
PG  - 465-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medical therapies and practices are
      widely employed in the treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To review 
      the usage of complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel
      syndrome, and to assess critically the basis and evidence for its use. METHODS: A
      systematic review of complementary and alternative medical therapies and
      practices in the irritable bowel syndrome was performed based on literature
      obtained through a Medline search. RESULTS: A wide variety of complementary and
      alternative medical practices and therapies are commonly employed by irritable
      bowel syndrome patients both in conjunction with and in lieu of conventional
      therapies. As many of these therapies have not been subjected to controlled
      clinical trials, some, at least, of their efficacy may reflect the high-placebo
      response rate that is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome. Of those that
      have been subjected to clinical trials most have involved small poor quality
      studies. There is, however, evidence to support efficacy for hypnotherapy, some
      forms of herbal therapy and certain probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.
      CONCLUSIONS: Doctors caring for irritable bowel syndrome patients need to
      recognize the near ubiquity of complementary and alternative medical use among
      this population and the basis for its use. All complementary and alternative
      medicine is not the same and some, such as hypnotherapy, forms of herbal therapy,
      specific diets and probiotics, may well have efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome. Above all, we need more science and more controlled studies; the
      absence of truly randomized placebo-controlled trials for many of these therapies
      has limited meaningful progress in this area.

TI  - Probiotics. Some evidence of their effectiveness.
PG  - 1487-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the term probiotics, to indicate how to identify products
      that have been proven beneficial, and to assess the quality of evidence regarding
      probiotics. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A few level I studies support the effectiveness 
      of specific probiotics for certain diagnoses. For most so-called probiotics,
      however, weak or no evidence supports their effectiveness. MAIN MESSAGE:
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer a health benefit on the host. Level I evidence supports use of VSL#3 for
      maintaining remission of inflammatory colitis. Probiotics for treating vaginal
      infections, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, have
      level I evidence of effectiveness, but are not available in Canada. Specific
      probiotics taken for certain indications improve health and have few side
      effects. CONCLUSION: Limited but good evidence supports the role of certain
      probiotics in medical practice. Because consumer pressure will undoubtedly
      stimulate further interest in probiotics, family doctors need to be informed
      about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.

TI  - Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome patients form a heterogeneous group
      with a variable contribution of central and peripheral components. The peripheral
      component is prominent in irritable bowel syndrome developing after infection
      (post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome) and this has proved a profitable area 
      of research. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have overthrown the dogma that
      irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by no abnormality of structure by
      demonstrating low-grade lymphocytic infiltration in the gut mucosa, increased
      permeability and increases in other inflammatory components including
      enterochromaffin and mast cells. Furthermore, increased inflammatory cytokines in
      both mucosa and blood have been demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome. While
      steroid treatment has proved ineffective, preliminary studies with probiotics
      exerting an anti-inflammatory effect have shown benefit. SUMMARY: The study of
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome has revealed the importance of low-grade
      inflammation in causing irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. It has suggested novel
      approaches to irritable bowel syndrome including studies of serotonin and
      histamine metabolism which may be relevant to other subtypes of the disease.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and probiotics: from rationale to clinical use.
PG  - 697-701
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Few therapies are of proven efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome. Thus, there is great interest in the development of a natural therapy
      that can be both safe and effective. An understanding that probiotics are
      heterogeneous, with multiple targets and mechanisms of action, is fundamental to 
      the development of clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: A bidirectional model for
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome is proposed in which gut-driven and 
      brain-driven mechanisms contribute to the genesis of gut dysfunction and
      symptoms. In-vitro and animal studies have generated most of the mechanistic
      rationale for the use of probiotics in functional bowel disorders. A MEDLINE
      search of publications from 1989 to date revealed only eight placebo-controlled
      clinical trials on the subject of probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome. All
      these studies suffer from methodologic problems. By contrast, numerous reviews
      have been published in the past 2 years on this subject. SUMMARY: Animal research
      will continue to identify novel targets and elucidate the mechanisms of action of
      probiotics, thus providing a rational basis for their use in irritable bowel
      syndrome. The notion of treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics is
      particularly attractive to patients and generates great interest, although
      clinical evidence is not yet sufficient to enable clear guidelines to be
      designed. Large, well-designed, controlled clinical trials using specific
      probiotics are warranted.

TI  - Probiotics and nutraceuticals: non-medicinal treatments of gastrointestinal
      diseases.
PG  - 596-603
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial and bioactive plant species has extended the known
      mechanism(s) of action of nutraceuticals and probiotics beyond simple nutrition
      and/or antimicrobial effects. The progressive unravelling of these plant and
      bacterial effects on systemic immune and intestinal epithelial cell function has 
      led to new credence for the use of probiotics and nutraceuticals in clinical
      medicine. Level I evidence now exists for the therapeutic use of probiotics in
      infectious diarrhea in children, recurrent Clostridium difficile-induced
      infections and post-operative pouchitis. Additional evidence is being acquired
      for the use of probiotics in other gastrointestinal infections, irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Not all individual probiotic strains
      have the same efficacy, and future clinical trials may focus on multistrain
      preparations agents with known efficacy. The use of nutraceuticals and probiotics
      as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders is rapidly moving into
      clinical usage. Scientific studies are providing mechanisms of action to explain 
      the therapeutic effects, and randomized controlled trials are providing the
      necessary evidence for their incorporation into the therapeutic armamentarium.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a probiotic combination VSL# 3 and placebo in
      irritable bowel syndrome with bloating.
PG  - 687-96
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of a combination probiotic on symptoms and colonic
      transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and significant bloating.
      METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Rome II IBS were randomized in a parallel
      group, double-blind design to placebo or VSL# 3 twice daily (31 patients received
      4 weeks and 17 patients 8 weeks of treatment). Pre- and post-treatment colonic
      transit measurements were performed using scintigraphy with (111)In charcoal.
      Symptoms were summarized as an average daily score for the entire period of
      treatment and separately for the first 4 weeks of treatment. Weekly satisfactory 
      relief of abdominal bloating was assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with VSL# 3 was
      associated with reduced flatulence over the entire treatment period (placebo 39.5
      +/- 2.6 vs VSL# 3 29.7 +/- 2.6, P = 0.011); similarly, during the first 4 weeks
      of treatment, flatulence scores were reduced (placebo 40.1 +/- 2.5 vs VSL# 3 30.8
      +/- 2.5, P = 0.014). Proportions of responders for satisfactory relief of
      bloating, stool-related symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating scores were not
      different. Colonic transit was retarded with VSL# 3 relative to placebo (colon
      geometric center 2.27 +/- 0.20 vs 2.83 +/- 0.19, P = 0.05 respectively).
      CONCLUSION: VSL# 3 reduces flatulence scores and retards colonic transit without 
      altering bowel function in patients with IBS and bloating.

TI  - Functional diarrhea.
PG  - 350-7
AB  - Functional diarrhea occurs as part of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and as
      an isolated symptom as functional (painless) diarrhea. Progress has been made in 
      defining these disorders and in identifying new mechanisms involved in symptom
      production. A strong link exists between intestinal infection and IBS, as is the 
      role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The importance of persistent subclinical
      inflammation is also emerging as a potential etiologic factor, particularly in
      post-infectious IBS. Although changes in the bacterial flora and bacterial
      overgrowth have been put forward as additional new contributors to symptom
      production, the case is not strong. These developments in pathogenesis have
      facilitated the introduction of new therapies. 5-HT(3) antagonists reduce bowel
      frequency and pain in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS, but their use is
      limited because of ischemic colitis. Prednisolone lacks efficacy, and early
      results with probiotics and herbal remedies are encouraging but require
      confirmation by larger trials.

TI  - A probiotic mixture alleviates symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a
      controlled 6-month intervention.
PG  - 387-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder of unknown
      aetiology. The effect of probiotics in this syndrome remains unclear. AIM: To
      investigate whether a probiotic mixture containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L.
      rhamnosus LC705, Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii 
      ssp. shermanii JS is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. 
      METHODS: A total of 103 patients fulfilling the Rome I or II criteria took part
      in this 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients 
      received a probiotic capsule or a placebo capsule daily. Gastrointestinal
      symptoms and bowel habits were recorded. RESULTS: At the end the total symptom
      score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + borborygmi) was 7.7 (95% CI:
      -13.9 to -1.6) points lower in the probiotic group (P = 0.015). This represents a
      median reduction of 42% in the symptom score of the probiotic group compared with
      6% in the placebo group. In individual symptoms, borborygmi was milder in the
      probiotic group (P = 0.008), and for the rest of the symptoms there was a
      non-significant trend. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this probiotic
      mixture is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
      Considering the high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and the lack of
      effective therapies, even a slight reduction in symptoms could have positive
      public health consequences.

      double-blind randomized control trial.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral administration of the probiotic
      Lactobacillus GG under randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled conditions 
      would improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in children. STUDY
      DESIGN: Fifty children fulfilling the Rome II criteria for IBS were given
      Lactobacillus GG or placebo for 6 weeks. Response to therapy was recorded and
      collected on a weekly basis using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale
      (GSRS). RESULTS: Lactobacillus GG was not superior to placebo in relieving
      abdominal pain (40.0% response rate in the placebo group vs 44.0% in the
      Lactobacillus GG group; P=.774). There was no difference in the other
      gastrointestinal symptoms, except for a lower incidence of perceived abdominal
      distention (P=.02 favoring Lactobacillus GG). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG was
      not superior to placebo in the treatment of abdominal pain in children with IBS
      but may help relieve such symptoms as perceived abdominal distention.

TI  - Prescript-Assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: a
      methodologically oriented, 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      clinical study.
PG  - 755-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The symptomatic efficacy of Prescript-Assist (Safer Medical, Inc.,
      Fort Benton, Montana), a treatment combining probiotic and prebiotic components, 
      has previously been evaluated clinically only in an open-label study in patients 
      with various gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted primarily to compare the effects of
      Prescript-Assist with placebo in patients with a diagnosis of IBS. Toward this
      objective, a secondary methodologic goal was to determine the number and nature
      of symptom clusters ("subsyndromic factors") that characterize IBS. METHODS: This
      was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in which patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either Prescript-Assist one 500-mg capsule BID or 1 
      placebo capsule BID for 2 weeks. Thirteen IBS symptoms identified from the
      clinical literature were embedded in a larger research instrument. Using a scale 
      from 0 to 5, patients rated the intensity of these symptoms for the 7-day period 
      immediately before the start of treatment, at the end of each study week, and
      after each of the 2 subsequent weeks (during which all patients received
      open-label Prescript-Assist as part of a larger study evaluating methodologic
      approaches to enhancing assessments of medication efficacy/safety). The
      symptom-intensity data were subjected to maximum likelihood factor analysis with 
      varimax rotation to identify any IBS subsyndromic factors, and the effect of
      treatment on each of the identified factors was evaluated using analyses of
      covariance with appropriate baseline-week assessments as covariate controls.
      RESULTS: The study included 25 patients with IBS (23 women, 2 men; age range,
      20-70 years). Three subsyndromic factors were identified that together accounted 
      for 60.2% of total IBS symptom variance: factor 1, general ill feelings/nausea;
      factor 2, indigestion/flatulence; and factor 3, colitis. Treatment with
      Prescript-Assist was associated with significant reductions in each of the
      subsyndromic factors. Factor 1 was significantly reduced by 0.345 standard score 
      units (F(1,46) = 4.26; P = 0.042), factor 2 by 0.544 standard score units
      (F(1,46) = 7.83; P = 0.008), and factor 3 by 0.826 standard score units (F(1,46) 
      = 10.20; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 3 subsyndromic factors of
      IBS: general ill feelings/nausea, indigestion/flatulence, and colitis. In this
      methodologically oriented double-blind study in patients with IBS, combined
      probiotic-prebiotic treatment with Prescript-Assist was associated with
      significant reductions in these factors.

TI  - Probiotics as a treatment strategy for gastrointestinal diseases?
PG  - 57-68
AB  - Current interest in probiotics is motivated not only by the clinical data showing
      efficacy of some probiotic bacteria but also by the increasing antibiotic
      resistance of pathogenic bacteria (particularly in hospitals) and the rise of
      consumers' demand for natural substitutes of drugs. Only few randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled human trials are available, and some involved
      only small numbers of patients. They are difficult to compare because of
      differences in probiotic strains employed, doses and formulation. Among probiotic
      applications, reduction of diarrhea is probably the best-documented effect
      confirmed by recent meta-analyses. Literature on Helicobacter pylori indicates
      that probiotics are unable to eradicate the infection but could be useful in
      decreasing infection levels and as adjuvants of therapy-associated side effects. 
      Studies performed in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that high doses of
      probiotics and most likely a combination of different lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria are more effective in decreasing inflammatory score and
      maintaining patients in remission than a single probiotic strain. Probiotic
      studies evaluating amelioration of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome would
      require more sustained patient numbers. However, accumulated data is encouraging 
      and suggests that efficacy is strain-dependent. Finally, too few probiotic
      intervention trials have been reported on colon cancer to allow any firm
      conclusion.

TI  - The efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 in the treatment of patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome--a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      study.
PG  - 925-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: It was suggested that the intestinal microflora may play a role in
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics may ease symptoms 
      in IBS patients by changing gut microflora, reducing mucosal inflammation and
      exerting antibacterial effects. AIM: To assess the short- and long-term effects
      of Lactobacillus reuteri administration on clinical symptoms of IBS. METHODS:
      This is a double blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial. Subjects consumed
      1x10(8)cfu/tablet twice a day. The clinical severity of the IBS symptoms was
      evaluated by the Francis Severity score and the IBS quality-of-life score at
      study entry and then monthly. RESULTS: In total, 54 subjects were randomized for 
      treatment and 39 concluded the study. Both groups (treatment and placebo)
      improved significantly in all the studied parameters with no significant
      differences between groups. Two parameters, constipation and passing gases, were 
      marginally different between the main groups (P=0.0714 and 0.0971, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms did not improve with probiotic treatment with L.
      reuteri. A strong placebo effect and a lack of uniformity of the IBS population
      may have hindered a clearer demonstration of the effect.

TI  - [Probiotics as therapeutic agents in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 467-71
AB  - Probiotics are defined as living micro-organisms which, when administered in
      large amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. The use of probiotics in the 
      therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of
      ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies
      proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the
      course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement 
      of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota 
      and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in
      reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather
      small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always
      closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the
      effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Potential future therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: will disease modifying
      therapy as opposed to symptomatic control become a reality?
PG  - 337-54
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome can remit spontaneously, implying cure is possible.
      Predictors of good prognosis include a short history, acute onset(possibly
      postinfective origin), absence of psychological disorders, and resolution of
      chronic life stressors. Possible-disease modifying treatments with long-lasting
      effects include diet and anti-inflammatory and psychological treatments. Dietary 
      modifications, which often involve excluding dairy and wheat products, are
      successful in some patients. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been subjected to 
      one RCT in postinfective IBS without benefit. Probiotics may have benefit in
      altering bacterial flora and as anti-inflammatory agents, but further trials are 
      needed before they can be recommended. Psychological treatments may produce
      long-lasting responses. Relaxation therapy appears to have a nonspecific benefit.
      Psychotherapy has been shown to have long-term benefit and is particularly
      acceptable to, and effective for, those with overt psychological distress.
      Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in randomized placebo controlled
      trials and has a sustained effect.

TI  - The role of food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 247-55
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome patients frequently believe that food intolerances are
      to blame for many of their symptoms, although not uncommonly this is caused by
      the nonspecific increase in gut motility that occurs with food ingestion.
      Nevertheless, dietary manipulation may result in substantial improvement in IBS
      symptomatology provided it is individualized to the particular patient. By
      further understanding the mechanisms involved in dietary intolerance, it should
      be possible to optimize the benefits of this approach to treatment.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) a common worldwide problem,
      particularly women, and presents from the teenage years onward. OBJECTIVE: This
      article discusses the causes, diagnosis and management of IBS. DISCUSSION:
      Disturbed motility and sensory function underlie much of the disturbance in
      function that, not infrequently, begins following an episode of gastroenteritis. 
      There is an intimate role for the brain-gut axis in modulating symptoms relating 
      to underlying causes of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, food intolerance and
      sensitivity, and abnormalities of corticotropin releasing factors. Management
      requires long term involvement with the patient as there is no single therapeutic
      strategy that is predictably effective. However, diet, bulking agents,
      antispasmodics and a variety of alternative therapies including herbs,
      probiotics, and psychological intervention are important in individual patients.

TI  - Use of diet and probiotic therapy in the irritable bowel syndrome: analysis of
      the literature.
PG  - S243-6
AB  - GOAL: The goal of this report is to review the use of dietary intake and
      probiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in published reports. 
      BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can be important in inducing symptoms that occur in
      patients with the IBS. Dietary intolerances, dietary allergies, specific food
      metabolites, and regular diet contents all may act as triggers and aggravate the 
      symptoms of IBS; but when any of these mechanisms can be proven to cause the
      symptoms, then their elimination results in the resolution of that patient's IBS.
      METHODS: Our previous review was updated. In addition, a careful Medline search
      was made for the years from 1975 to 2004 to evaluate human research reports on
      diet and probiotics in the IBS. Forty-six manuscripts were reviewed on diet and
      six were available on probiotic use in IBS. The most common dietary factor
      evaluated in the literature was bran, and the most common probiotic used was
      Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSIONS: Although investigations have shown that
      bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does
      not reveal conclusive evidence that diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the
      limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing
      symptoms. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both
      dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.

TI  - Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in irritable bowel syndrome: symptom responses 
      and relationship to cytokine profiles.
PG  - 541-51
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the response of symptoms 
      and cytokine ratios in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with ingestion of probiotic
      preparations containing a lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strain. METHODS:
      Seventy-seven subjects with IBS were randomized to receive either Lactobacillus
      salivarius UCC4331 or Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, each in a dose of 1 x 10 10
      live bacterial cells in a malted milk drink, or the malted milk drink alone as
      placebo for 8 weeks. The cardinal symptoms of IBS were recorded on a daily basis 
      and assessed each week. Quality of life assessment, stool microbiologic studies, 
      and blood sampling for estimation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell release of
      the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 were performed at the beginning and
      at the end of the treatment phase. RESULTS: For all symptoms, with the exception 
      of bowel movement frequency and consistency, those randomized to B infantis 35624
      experienced a greater reduction in symptom scores; composite and individual
      scores for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and bowel movement
      difficulty were significantly lower than for placebo for those randomized to B
      infantis 35624 for most weeks of the treatment phase. At baseline, patients with 
      IBS demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, indicative of a proinflammatory, 
      Th-1 state. This ratio was normalized by B infantis 35624 feeding alone.
      CONCLUSIONS: B infantis 35624 alleviates symptoms in IBS; this symptomatic
      response was associated with normalization of the ratio of an anti-inflammatory
      to a proinflammatory cytokine, suggesting an immune-modulating role for this
      organism, in this disorder.

TI  - A non-dairy probiotic's (poi) influence on changing the gastrointestinal tract's 
      microflora environment.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora
      adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are 
      probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts
      confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain
      health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a
      Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro
      plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of
      poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the
      gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study
      included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and
      control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week
      washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 
      4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as 
      their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed
      fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2
      cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary
      records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and
      post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no
      significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus
      following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of
      specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is
      analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not
      alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet
      feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus,
      Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency
      or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods.
      CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual
      bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might
      determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2
      days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations
      may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.

TI  - Probiotics and gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 78-92
AB  - There is increasing evidence indicating health benefits by consumption of foods
      containing microorganisms, i.e. probiotics. A number of clinical trials have been
      performed to evaluate the effects in the prevention and treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms or by disturbances 
      in the normal microflora. Gastrointestinal infections caused by Helicobacter
      pylori, traveller's diarrhoea, rotavirus diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhoea are conditions that
      have been studied. There are also studies performed on the preventive effect of
      probiotics on radiation-induced diarrhoea and diarrhoea in tube-fed patients.
      Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, two idiopathic
      conditions where alterations in the normal microflora have been implicated as
      responsible for initiation, are two further areas where the use of probiotics has
      been regarded as promising. The results from clinical studies have not been
      conclusive in that the effects of probiotics have been strain-dependent and
      different study designs have been used. Treatment of acute diarrhoea in children 
      and prevention of AAD are the two most justified areas for the application of
      probiotics.
