TI  - Ramadan fasting and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 239-41
AB  - Ramadan fasting may induce changes in gastrointestinal physiology. The effect of 
      this fasting on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not known. We conducted a
      cohort study in the month of Ramadan in 2006 to assess the effect of Ramadan
      fasting on IBD. Sixty patients with IBD, who were in remission and undertook
      fasting according to their own free will underwent assessment of quality-of-life 
      (QoL) parameters, psychological state and the severity of symptoms before and
      after Ramadan. There was no correlation between the number of fasting days and
      the severity of the disease, QoL and psychological state of the patients. QoL did
      not change after Ramadan. Younger patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) fasted
      for a greater number of days (p=0.01) compared to older patients. The mean score 
      of anxiety, using a modified version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      was 12.7 (6.0) before Ramadan in women with UC, and decreased to 9.8 (4.4)
      afterfasting (p=0.026). Men with UC had a mean score of colitis activity index of
      3.5 before Ramadan, which decreased to 1.7 after fasting (p=0.008). It appears
      that Ramadan fasting does not impose serious risks on patients with IBD.

TI  - Lymphocytic colitis in a child with non-responsive celiac disease.
PG  - 393-5
AB  - In celiac disease, symptoms usually improve with strict adherence to diet. Some
      patients however do not show improvement despite of diet therapy. We here report 
      a girl with non-responsive celiac disease whose diarrhea did not improve despite 
      of a gluten free diet. A 12-year-old girl with recurrent diarrhea and failure to 
      thrive was diagnosed with celiac disease. After six months of gluten-free diet
      her symptoms persisted. Adherence to diet was considered as correct and complete 
      by a dietitian evaluation and by anti-endomysial antibodies that had become
      negative. Treatment with pancreatic enzymes, metronidazole or lactose free diet
      did not improve her symptoms. Colonoscopy was performed and lymphocytic colitis
      was diagnosed on histology from colonic biopsies. After mesalamine therapy
      diarrhea ceased, and weight and height z scores increased. Lymphocytic colitis,
      which is uncommonly seen in children compared to adults, should be considered in 
      nonresponsive celiac disease in children.

PG  - 1794-801

AB  - The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully
      understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and 
      intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an
      important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of
      dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may
      be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese
      epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between
      food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control
      studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the
      reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found
      several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and 
      sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological
      data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to
      increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary
      animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased
      consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes 
      in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized
      food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of 
      IBD.

TI  - Effects of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals in patients with
      short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1085-93
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328303c00a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired
      health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased
      costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially
      processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This
      study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed
      cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a
      randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26
      intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients.
      The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first
      allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of
      surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume,
      nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life,
      peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake
      of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup
      analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's 
      disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated
      procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed
      cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were
      not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as
      effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general
      and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy 
      techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for
      this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying
      diagnosis and the surgical method used.

PG  - 298-307
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03886.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) can cause metabolic 
      and inflammatory alterations. AIM: To evaluate the relationships between
      inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA)
      composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw
      Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition
      were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters 
      were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the 
      number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic
      acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were
      inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP
      in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was
      correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated 
      in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and
      systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the
      active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the
      systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the
      systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal 
      disease activity.

TI  - Laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis: a
      comparative observational study on long-term functional results.
PG  - 526-32
LID - 10.1007/s11605-008-0755-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Long-term results after laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA)
      have not been thoroughly evaluated. Our study prospectively compares short- and
      long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and open IPAA. METHODS: Between October 2002
      and November 2007, 73 laparoscopic and 106 open IPAA patients were enrolled.
      Patient- and disease-specific characteristics and short- and long-term outcomes
      were prospectively collected. RESULTS: There were no differences in demographics,
      treatment, indication, duration of surgery, and diversion between groups.
      Laparoscopic patients had faster return of flatus (p = 0.008), faster assumption 
      of a liquid diet (p < 0.001), and less blood loss (p = 0.026). While
      complications were similar, the incidence of incisional hernias was lower in the 
      laparoscopic group (p = 0.011). Mean follow-up was 24.8 months. Average number of
      bowel movements was 6.8 +/- 2.8/day for laparoscopy and 6.3 +/- 1.7 for open (p =
      0.058). Overall, 68.4% of patients were fully continent at 1 year, up to 83.7%
      long term without differences between groups. Other indicators of defecatory
      function and quality of life remain similar overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic
      IPAA confers excellent functional results. Most patients are fully continent and 
      have an average of six bowel movements/day. When present, minor incontinence
      improves over time. Laparoscopy mirrors the results of open IPAA and is a
      valuable alternative to open surgery.

TI  - Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease patients in northern India: frequency 
      and factors influencing its development.
PG  - 95-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often under
      nourished. Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with
      IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty,
      where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative
      colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS)
      were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical
      parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39
      (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs.
      2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73],
      p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric
      parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23
      [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001)
      and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness
      (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm
      [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though
      patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g,
      respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g,
      range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses,
      MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable
      between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between
      patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active
      disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition 
      is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.

TI  - Diverticulitis: new frontiers for an old country: risk factors and pathogenesis.
PG  - 1128-9
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318188adb1 [doi]
AB  - The understanding of diverticulitis has advanced little beyond the initial
      postulates of Burkitt and Painter who proposed that diverticular disease results 
      from a deficiency of dietary fiber. Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are
      viewed simply as a consequence of a diet, which takes in relatively little fiber.
      Our understanding of diverticulitis has not advanced beyond these basic concepts.
      As many as two-thirds of individuals in the West have diverticular disease by the
      age of 85 years, but only 10% to 25% will manifest any related clinical symptoms.
      Other than age, several risk factors have been identified for the development of 
      diverticular disease and diverticulitis. In particular, obesity and red meat
      intake are risk factors. Smoking is more controversial and alcohol, coffee, and
      caffeine have not shown to be risk factors. Vegetable intake, a strict vegetable 
      diet, and increased fiber intake decreases the risk of development of
      diverticular disease, as well as diverticulitis. Physical activity also seems
      protective. Despite these evidences, the risk factors and pathophysiology
      progression from asymptomatic diverticular disease to diverticulitis have been
      inadequately studied. This subject is reviewed in more detail in this manuscript.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Thirty four years since the discovery of gastrointestinal melatonin.
PG  - 33-51
AB  - After the discovery of melatonin in the pineal gland by Lerner and co-workers in 
      1958, melatonin was also detected in the retina and the human appendix. Later,
      melatonin was confirmed immunohistologically in all segments of the
      gastrointestinal tract (GIT), in the guts of bovine embryos and in the GIT of low
      vertebrates. Melatonin was also confirmed in the pancreas and the hepatobiliary
      system. Melatonin is produced in the enteroendocrine cells of the GIT mucosa. The
      concentrations of melatonin in the GIT are 10-100x higher than in the plasma and 
      the total amount of melatonin in the GIT is around 400x higher than the amount of
      melatonin in the pineal gland. Similar to pineal melatonin, GIT melatonin is a
      multifunctional compound which exhibits some general as well as some specific
      effects, depending on the organ and the location of GIT tissue. In the GIT,
      melatonin exhibits endocrine, paracrine, autocrine and luminal actions.
      Generally, the episodic secretion of melatonin from the GIT is related to the
      intake and digestion of food and to the prevention of tissue damage caused by
      hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes. Some actions, such as the scavenging of 
      hydroxyl free radicals, immunoenhancement and antioxidant effects are of general 
      nature, whereas others, such as an increase of mucosal blood flow, the reduction 
      of peristalsis and the regulation of fecal water content, are specific to the
      tubular GIT. Generally, melatonin actions oppose those of serotonin. Laboratory
      and clinical studies indicate that the utilization of melatonin can prevent or
      treat pathological conditions such as esophageal and gastric ulcers,
      pancreatitis, colitis, irritable bowel disease, and colon cancer.

TI  - Intestinal inflammation in nursing infants: different causes and a single
      treatment ... but of protected origin.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - Three case histories of nursing infants suffering from different forms of
      intestinal problems, who underwent special dietary therapy in order to solve
      situations that would be difficult to deal with using the special artificial milk
      varieties on the market, are presented. These children were administered a
      homemade food consisting ofParmigiano Reggiano cheese seasoned for at least 36
      months, rice or maize custard and tapioca, sugar, maize oil. In the first case
      the diagnosis of "widespread nonspecific acute colitis" was made compatible with 
      "antibiotic-associated colitis" and Clostridium difficile was isolated from the
      feces. The second case, under the suspicion of cow's milk allergy, was fed by
      soya and hydrolyzed milk with persitent disturbed alvus with greenish feces and
      mucus. The third case was represented by a nursing child with persistent
      diarrhoic alvus after an acute episode with subsequent intolerance to rice milk. 
      After the introduction of the food based on Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, all cases
      showed a rapid and progressive improvement of symptoms and alvus characteristics 
      and were discharged with increased weight. The Parmigiano Reggiano cheese shows a
      high concentration of easily absorbed amino acids and oligopeptides like a
      hydrolyzed proteic preparation. As regards the lipoid component the medium and
      short chain fatty acids are directly absorbed in the bowel and immediately usable
      as a significant source of energy. Finally, another relevant characteristic of
      Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is the complete absence of lactose. The use of
      Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as a dietary therapy is appropriate not only for its
      high nutritional value, but also for its characteristics as a functional food
      that produces beneficial effects on health with regards to the gastrointestinal
      tract and the inflammatory problems resulting from alimentary intolerance,
      post-therapeutic antibiotic dismicrobism, or post-infective conditions. Moreover,
      its efficay on these pathologic conditions is further improved by the prebiotic
      and probiotic effects resulting from the oligosaccharides and the bacterial flora
      of this natural food product, only derived from the nature and the work of
      skilled artisans closely tied to tradition.

TI  - Evaluation of bone mineral density among patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      in a tertiary care setting in India.
PG  - 103-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have low bone mineral 
      density (BMD). Dietary calcium is important for them in the prevention of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis. There are no reports on the status of BMD in Indian 
      patients with IBD. METHODS: Dietary calcium intake and cumulative steroid and
      immunosuppressive drug use was noted in 46 randomly selected patients (mean [SD] 
      age 40.5 [14.7] years; 28 men) with IBD (ulcerative colitis 22, Crohn's disease
      24). To compare values of BMD for patients, data from 46 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls (age 40.5 [14.6] years; 28 men) were selected from an existing
      database of healthy Indian volunteers whose BMD had been measured in a
      community-based survey carried out among people residing in Delhi (unpublished
      data). BMD was measured using DXA (Hologic QDR 4500). Osteopenia and osteoporosis
      were defined as per the standard WHO criteria. RESULTS: The mean duration of
      disease was 87.7 (78.3) months. The mean calcium intake by 41 patients (89.1%)
      was <200 mg/day, by 2 patients (4.3%) 200-400 mg/day and by 3 patients (6.4%)>400
      mg/day. Significantly lower values of BMD at the spine and hip regions were seen 
      in patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease as compared with
      Indian healthy controls. In comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 
      29 (63%) and 21 (45.6%) patients had either osteopenia or osteoporosis at the
      spine and hip region, respectively. Of them, 4 and 7 patients had osteoporosis at
      the spine and hip region, respectively. There was no correlation between values
      of BMD and the age of patient, duration of disease, and cumulative steroid dose. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of Indian patients with IBD have low BMD. Since the
      intake of dietary calcium is inadequate in a majority of these patients, they
      should be advised to increase the intake of dairy products.

PG  - 2605-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2008.02035.x [doi]
AB  - Cow's milk protein-induced proctocolitis presents with overt rectal bleeding in
      otherwise healthy infants and is characterized by an eosinophilic infiltrate of
      the left colonic mucosa. Although it is the most common cause of proctocolitis in
      infancy, dietary protein-induced proctocolitis had hardly ever been reported in
      childhood so far. We hereby report 16 otherwise healthy children aged 2-14 yr,
      who presented over a 6-yr period with persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding
      related to a mild form of left-sided colitis characterized by a prominent
      eosinophilic infiltration, focal lymphoid follicle hyperplasia, and a prompt
      clinical and histological response to a cow's milk-free diet. No patient had a
      history of food-induced proctocolitis during infancy, and most patients did not
      show an IgE-mediated response to cow's milk protein. Half of the patients did
      have other gastrointestinal symptoms, but no systemic symptoms were present and
      other causes of colitis were excluded by appropriate investigation. Tolerance to 
      cow's milk protein developed in half of the patients within a year. Dietary
      protein-induced proctocolitis is a relatively common cause of overt rectal
      bleeding in childhood, and its features are remarkably similar to those of
      dietary protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy.

TI  - Phlebosclerotic colitis.
PG  - 164-7
AB  - Phlebosclerotic colitis (PC) is a rare form of ischemic colitis that usually
      affects the right hemicolon. It is due to ischemia induced by phlebosclerosis in 
      the branches of the superior mesenteric vein that disturb venous return from the 
      colon. The clinical course is different from that of the more common type of
      ischemic colitis caused by arterial disease. We encountered a 73-year-old woman
      with PC who had the characteristic computed tomographic finding of fine linear
      venous calcification that was mainly perpendicular to the long axis of the colon.

TI  - Increased folate intake with no changes in serum homocysteine and decreased

PG  - 627-33

AB  - In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status 
      regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis)
      received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients 
      for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the
      study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of
      anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and
      blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid,
      homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency
      was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the 
      patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake
      (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid,
      homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant
      decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained
      at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of
      patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and
      homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to
      choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the
      inflammatory process.

PG  - 216-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.06.014 [doi]
AB  - In the last decades there has been continual interest in site-specific delivery
      to the colon. Recently, new types of site-specific delivery formulations have
      been developed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and other colon related
      diseases. The aim of the present study was to establish a physiologically
      relevant IVIVC for two prototypes using a prospective in vitro study. Caffeine, a
      drug being absorbed along the entire gastrointestinal tract, was selected as a
      model drug. USP apparatus 3, the BioDis, was used for all experiments and the
      passage through the gastrointestinal tract was simulated with a physiologically
      based pH-gradient. Subsequently, the fraction of drug released in vitro was
      compared with the fraction of drug released in vivo, which was determined in
      humans in a separate study. Results indicated that the BioDis method is very
      useful in terms of predicting the site/timing and extent of drug release from the
      prototypes, since an a priori IVIVC could be established. Moreover, from the
      results generated in the present study, it is obvious that novel pH- and
      time-based multi-unit formulations would improve selectivity of drug delivery to 
      the distal ileum and the colon and therefore might be very helpful in the
      treatment of colonic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of emergency
      laparoscopic surgical management of complicated diverticular disease. METHOD: A
      prospectively collected electronic database of all colorectal laparoscopic
      procedures between April 2001 and September 2007 has been used to identify
      outcomes in patients presenting with complicated diverticular disease. RESULTS:
      Sixty-six patients (28 men), median age 69 years (23-95), ASA grade II (12), III 
      (38), IV (16) have undergone emergency surgery for complicated
      diverticulitis--Hinchey grades I (27), II (29), III (7) and diverticular bleeding
      (3) over a 6(1/2)-year period: 43 high anterior resections, 17 Hartmann's
      resections and seven low anterior resections. Diverticular fistulas were seen in 
      16 patients: colovaginal (7), colovesical (2), colo-fallopian (4), entero-colic
      (3). The median operation time was 110 min (45-195 min). There was one conversion
      to open surgery. Postoperative analgesia was provided by intravenous Paracetamol 
      in 33 patients (50%), patient-controlled analgesia in 24 (36%), oral Paracetamol 
      and Oramorph (12%) and epidural opioid infusion (1.5%). The median time to normal
      diet was 24 h (4 h-6 days) and median hospital stay 5 days (2-30). There were two
      deaths (3.3%); anastomotic leak, ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest.
      Other complications included: wound infection eight (12%), anastomotic leak four 
      (8%), port-site hernia one and one case of Clostridium difficile colitis
      requiring colectomy. There were five (7.5%) returns to theatre and two
      readmissions (3%). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resectional surgery in complicated
      diverticular disease is a feasible, safe and a largely predictable operation that
      allows for early hospital discharge and, in our opinion, improved patient care.
      We are encouraged to continue to offer our patients the option of an emergency
      laparoscopic resection.

TI  - Rebamipide enema therapy for left-sided ischemic colitis patients accompanied by 
      ulcers: open label study.
PG  - 4059-64
AB  - AIM: To attempt rectal administration of rebamipide in the treatment of ischemic 
      colitis patients with ulcers, and evaluate its effects. METHODS: We compared 9
      ischemic colitis patients (2 men, 7 women) with ulcers treated by bowel rest only
      from 2000 to 2005 (conventional therapy group), with 6 patients (2 men, 4 women) 
      treated by rebamipide enema therapy in 2006 (rebamipide enema therapy group) and 
      analyzed the mean duration of fasting and hospitalization, degree of ulcer
      healing, and decrease in WBC count for the two groups. RESULTS: The mean duration
      of fasting and hospitalization were 2.7+/-1.8 d and 9.2+/-1.5 d in the rebamipide
      group and 7.9+/-4.1 d and 17.9+/-6.8 d in the control group, respectively, and
      significantly reduced in the rebamipide group (t= -2.915; P=0.0121 and t= -3.054;
      P=0.0092). As for the degree of ulcer healing at 7 d after admission, the ulcer
      score was reduced by 3.5+/-0.5 (points) in the rebamipide group and 2.8+/-0.5
      (points) in the control group (t=1.975; P=0.0797), while the decrease in WBC
      count was 120.0+/-55.8 (x 10(2)/microL) in the rebamipide group and 85.9+/-56.8
      (x 10(2)/microL) in the control group (t=1.006; P=0.3360). CONCLUSION: In
      left-sided ischemic colitis patients with ulcers, rebamipide enema therapy
      significantly reduced the duration of fasting and hospitalization, recommending
      its use as a new and effective therapeutic alternative.

TI  - Diverticulosis and colorectal cancer: between lights and shadows.
PG  - 763-70
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31816200fb [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of diverticulosis and colorectal cancer (CRC) is markedly
      increased in the last century. Both diseases are highly frequent in Western
      countries and in aged people. Western diet--low in fiber and rich in dietary
      fat--has been largely regarded to play a major role in the pathogenesis of both
      conditions. A causal relationship between diverticulosis and CRC has been
      suggested in different studies. Epidemiologic series found a more frequent
      rectosigmoid localization of neoplastic lesions (advanced adenoma and CRC) in
      patients with diverticulosis as compared with controls, particularly in those
      with a previous diverticulitis episode or with an extensive disease. However,
      data are still controversial, with other studies failing to confirm this
      observation. Such discrepancy could be referred to the highly heterogeneous study
      design and setting in the different epidemiologic series. Pathologic studies
      showed that either macroscopic and microscopic chronic inflammation--which is
      regarded as risk factor for CRC development--is present in the colonic mucosa of 
      some patients with diverticula. Moreover, alterations in the extracellular
      matrix, also involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, have been depicted in
      diverticulosis. In addition, an upward shifting of cell proliferation occurs in
      diverticular mucosa, and in nondiverticular patients with advanced adenomas.
      Finally, aberrant crypt foci--which are considered potential markers of CRC risk 
      in ulcerative colitis--have been detected in colonic mucosa of patients with
      diverticulosis. Despite this substantial amount of evidence, however, the
      available data are not yet strong enough to suggest a more aggressive CRC
      prevention in diverticular as compared with nondiverticular subjects.

TI  - IBD and IBD mimicking enterocolitis in children younger than 2 years of age.
PG  - 149-55
LID - 10.1007/s00431-008-0721-2 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.

TI  - Blockade of adenosine A2B receptors ameliorates murine colitis.
PG  - 127-37
LID - 10.1038/bjp.2008.227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The adenosine 2B (A2B) receptor is the predominant
      adenosine receptor expressed in the colon. Acting through the A2B receptor,
      adenosine mediates chloride secretion, as well as fibronectin and interleukin
      (IL)-6 synthesis and secretion in intestinal epithelial cells. A2B receptor mRNA 
      and protein expression are increased during human and murine colitis. However,
      the effect of the A2B receptor in the activation of the intestinal inflammatory
      response is not known. In this study, we examined the effect of A2B receptor
      antagonism on murine colitis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Dextran sodium sulphate
      (DSS)-treated mice and piroxicam-treated IL-10-/- mice were used as animal models
      of colitis. The A2B receptor-selective antagonist, ATL-801, was given in the
      diet. KEY RESULTS: Mice fed ATL-801 along with DSS showed a significantly lower
      extent and severity of colitis than mice treated with DSS alone, as shown by
      reduced clinical symptoms, histological scores, IL-6 levels and proliferation
      indices. The administration of ATL-801 prevented weight loss, suppressed the
      inflammatory infiltrate into colonic mucosa and decreased epithelial hyperplasia 
      in piroxicam-treated IL-10-/- mice. IL-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) 
      concentrations in the supernatants of colonic organ cultures from colitic mice
      were significantly reduced by ATL-801 administration. CONCLUSIONS AND
      IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that the intestinal
      epithelial A2B receptor is an important mediator of pro-inflammatory responses in
      the intestine and that A2B receptor blockade may be an effective therapeutic
      strategy to treat inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Total laparoscopic juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
PG  - 37-42
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2008.02.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes our experience of total laparoscopic juxtarenal 
      abdominal aortic aneurysm (JAAA) repair. METHODS: Between February 2002 and
      October 2007, we performed 148 total laparoscopic AAA repairs, including a subset
      of 13 patients who underwent a laparoscopic JAAA repair. Median age was 70 years 
      (range, 50-81years). Median aneurysm size was 55 mm (range, 50-80 mm). Eight
      patients were in American Society of Anesthesiologist class II, and five were in 
      class III. We used laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrorenal approaches and
      suprarenal clamping in all patients. RESULTS: We implanted tube grafts in nine
      patients and bifurcated grafts in four. No conversions to open repair were
      required. Median operative time was 260 minutes (range, 180-355 minutes). Total
      median aortic clamping time was 77 minutes (range, 36-105 minutes). Median
      suprarenal clamping time was 24 minutes (range, 9-37 minutes). Median blood loss 
      was 855 mL (range, 215-2100 mL). No patients died. One patient had a
      postoperative coagulopathy with hemorrhagic syndrome. Five patients had moderate 
      systemic complications, including four renal insufficiencies without dialysis and
      one grade I ischemic colitis. Liquid diet was reintroduced after 1 day (range,
      1-7 days). Most patients were ambulatory by day 3 (range, 2-17 days). Median
      lengths of stay were 48 hours (range, 12-336 hours) in the intensive care unit
      and 10 days (range, 4-30 days) in the hospital. With a median follow-up of 19
      months (range, 1-36 months), patients had complete recovery without graft
      anomalies. CONCLUSION: Total laparoscopic JAAA repair is feasible and worthwhile 
      for patients. Prior experience in laparoscopic aortic surgery is essential to
      perform these challenging procedures. Despite these encouraging results, a
      greater experience is required to ensure the benefit of this technique compared
      with open repair.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids exacerbate DSS-induced colitis through decreased adiponectin 
      in colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts.
PG  - 1348-57
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the immunoregulatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid and
      adiponectin have been postulated, their role in intestinal inflammation is
      controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary fat intake 
      influences activity of colonic inflammation through modulating this system.
      METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received dextran sulfate sodium for induction of colitis.
      Mice were fed a control diet, omega-3 fat-rich diet, omega-6 fat-rich diet, or
      saturated fat-rich diet. Some mice were administered a peroxisome proliferator
      activated receptor-gamma; agonist, pioglitazone. Messenger RNA expression of
      adiponectin and its receptors were analyzed. Adiponectin expression in colonic
      mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients was also analyzed. RESULTS: The receptors
      for adiponectin were found to be ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells,
      intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina proprial mononuclear cells, and subepithelial
      myofibroblasts from colonic tissue, but adiponectin was only expressed in
      myofibroblasts. Induction of colitis significantly decreased the expression of
      adiponectin in colonic mucosa. The omega-3 fat diet group, but not the other fat 
      diet groups, showed exacerbated colitis with a further decrease of adiponectin
      expression. Pioglitazone treatment ameliorated the level of decrease in
      adiponectin expression and improved colonic inflammation induced by the omega-3
      fat-rich diet. In patients with ulcerative colitis, the expression level of
      adiponectin in colonic mucosa was also decreased compared with that in control
      mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin was found to be expressed in myofibroblasts.
      Adiponectin expression was significantly suppressed by induction of colitis, and 
      aggravation of colitis after exposure to omega-3 fat may be due to a further
      decrease in the expression level of adiponectin.

      patients with ulcerative colitis. Free radical activity and the status of lipid
      soluble antioxidant vitamins have not been previously assessed in patients with
      IPAA. The aim of the present study was to measure the plasma concentrations of
      lipophyllic antioxidants and free radical activity in IPAA patients and compare
      them with normal subjects. METHOD: Forty-eight IPAA patients and 50 healthy
      controls were studied. A dietary assessment of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and
      carotene was undertaken and plasma antioxidant status was assessed. Plasma
      malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to assess the extent of free radical damage.
      In IPAA patients, association between the degree of inflammation in the pouch
      mucosa and the plasma concentration of lipophyllic antioxidants and extent of
      free radical activity was investigated. RESULTS: The dietary intake of carotene
      was similar in both groups. Intake of vitamin E was significantly lower in
      patients than controls (P = 0.01). In the IPAA group plasma concentrations of
      alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene were significantly lower (P < 0.001)
      and alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio significantly higher (P < 0.001). Free
      radical damage was significantly greater in patients than controls (P < 0.01).
      There were no significant correlations between the degree of inflammation in the 
      pouch and plasma concentrations of MDA, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol
      ratio or intake of vitamins. CONCLUSION: Compared with normal subjects, patients 
      with IPAA have significantly lower plasma concentrations of lipophyllic
      antioxidants alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene and higher free radical
      activity suggesting increased oxidative stress. These differences do not appear
      to be related to diet and do not correlate with histological severity of pouch
      inflammation.

AB  - Adipocytokines are a group of adipocyte-secreted proteins that have significant
      effects on the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates, as well as numerous other 
      processes. A number of recent studies have indicated that some adipocytokines may
      significantly influence the proliferation of malignant cells in vitro, whereas it
      remains unclear whether they have similar roles in vivo. In this study, we
      determined serum levels of adipocytokines in mice with azoxymethane (AOM)- and
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colon carcinogenesis. Five-week-old ICR mice
      were given a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM followed by 1% DSS in
      drinking water for 7 days. Nobiletin (NOB), a citrus flavonoid, was given in the 
      diet (100 p.p.m) for 17 weeks. Thereafter, the incidence and number of colon
      tumors and serum concentration of adipocytokines were determined at the end of
      week 20. The serum leptin level in AOM/DSS-treated mice was six times higher than
      that in untreated mice, whereas there were no significant differences in the
      levels of triglycerides, adiponectin and interleukin-6. Feeding with NOB
      abolished colonic malignancy and notably decreased the serum leptin level by 75%.
      Further, NOB suppressed the leptin-dependent, but not independent, proliferation 
      of HT-29 colon cancer cells and decreased leptin secretion through inactivation
      of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signaling-regulated protein
      kinase, but not that of adiponectin in differentiated 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes in 
      a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that higher levels
      of leptin in serum promote colon carcinogenesis in mice, whereas NOB has
      chemopreventive effects against colon carcinogenesis, partly through regulation
      of leptin levels.

TI  - Refeeding syndrome: a potentially fatal condition but remains underdiagnosed and 
      undertreated.
PG  - 604-6
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.01.053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of successfully prevented refeeding syndrome in 
      a high-risk group of patients. METHODS: Case 1 was a 70-y-old woman who presented
      with a 4-mo history of poor dietary intake and ill health due to a connective
      tissue disease leading to myositis and dysphagia and complicated by respiratory
      failure needing mechanical ventilation. Twelve hours after starting nasogastric
      tube feeding, she developed a cardiac arrest from which she was successfully
      resuscitated. Repeated attempts to wean her from the ventilator failed. Case 2
      was a 15-y-old girl who was readmitted after a total colectomy for severe
      ulcerative colitis with diarrhea and vomiting leading to significant weight loss.
      Her body mass index was 11.4 kg/m(2). RESULTS: In case 1, after consultation by
      the clinical nutrition team, the diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made and the
      patient was duly started on a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet,
      multivitamin and trace-element supplements, and electrolyte infusion.
      Subsequently she was successfully weaned from the ventilator. In case 2, further 
      investigation by the clinical nutrition team revealed low baseline electrolyte
      concentrations including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate and low
      serum albumin. Her low body mass index and baseline electrolyte concentrations
      put her at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome. She was initially started 
      on low-calorie feeding, multivitamin and minerals, and her electrolytes were
      carefully monitored. She made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Refeeding syndrome is 
      a life-threatening, underdiagnosed, treatable condition but there is a need for a
      wider awareness of the condition among health professionals.

TI  - Diet in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis: a European prospective cohort study.
PG  - 57-64
LID - 10.1159/000121412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The causes of ulcerative colitis are unknown, although it is
      plausible that dietary factors are involved. Case-control studies of diet and
      ulcerative colitis are subject to recall biases. The aim of this study was to
      examine the prospective relationship between the intake of nutrients and the
      development of ulcerative colitis in a cohort study. METHODS: The study
      population was 260,686 men and women aged 20-80 years, participating in a large
      European prospective cohort study (EPIC). Participants were residents in the UK, 
      Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy. Information on diet was supplied and the
      subjects were followed up for the development of ulcerative colitis. Each
      incident case was matched with four controls and dietary variables were divided
      into quartiles. RESULTS: A total of 139 subjects with incident ulcerative colitis
      were identified. No dietary associations were detected, apart from a marginally
      significant positive association with an increasing percentage intake of energy
      from total polyunsaturated fatty acids (trend across quartiles OR = 1.19 (95% CI 
      = 0.99-1.43) p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: No associations between ulcerative colitis
      and diet were detected, apart from a possible increased risk with a higher total 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid intake. A biological mechanism exists in that
      polyunsaturated fatty acids are metabolised to pro-inflammatory mediators.

TI  - Laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with chronic ulcerative
      colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis: a case-matched study.
PG  - 549-53
LID - 10.1007/s10350-008-9250-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare short-term outcomes after
      laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with those of open ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis in patients with both sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis. 
      METHODS: Sixteen patients with sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis
      undergoing laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis were matched with 16 open
      ileal pouch control subjects by sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists'
      score, age, and body mass index. RESULTS: Operative mortality was zero. Operative
      time was longer in the laparoscopic group (500 +/- 125.8 vs. 381.8 +/- 60.9
      minutes, P = 0.03). Thirty-day complications were not significantly different
      between groups (laparoscopic 25 percent vs. open 43.7 percent, P = 0.26). Length 
      of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (5.3 +/- 1.3 days vs.
      9.9 +/- 3.3 days open, P < 0.001). Average return of gastrointestinal function
      was 2.5 days in the laparoscopic group and 4.8 days in the open group (P =
      0.001). Time to soft diet was three days in the laparoscopic group and six days
      in the open group (P < 0.001). All patients were alive and all pouches were
      intact at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 
      is feasible with apparent safety in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis,
      resulting in shorter duration of hospital stay and quicker return of
      gastrointestinal function compared with the open procedure with no difference in 
      perioperative complications, reoperations, and readmissions.

TI  - Dietary lipids in early development and intestinal inflammatory disease.
PG  - S188-93
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are life-long reoccurring inflammatory disorders of
      the gastrointestinal tract and have been increasing in incidence in recent
      decades, notably in the pediatric population. Although genetic predisposition
      remains an important factor, this increased incidence most likely reflects an
      environmental change. One potential contributor to this is the change in dietary 
      fat intake, with dietary intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      following a similar temporal pattern to the change in inflammatory bowel disease 
      incidence. Dietary n-6 PUFAs comprise a major, modifiable, environmental factor
      known to promote a heightened inflammatory response through a number of pathways,
      including their role as precursors for synthesis of eicosanoids and their
      inhibitory effect on the synthesis of the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentanoic acid and
      docosahexanoic acid. The increase in n-6 PUFA intake affects individuals of all
      ages, with fetal PUFA accretion and infant dietary PUFA intake from breast milk
      reflecting maternal dietary intake. A high level of n-6 PUFA in milk results in
      increased n-6 PUFA in colonic phospholipids and an exaggerated inflammatory
      response to chemically induced colitis. Conversely, during development, a diet
      low in n-6 PUFAs and high in n-3 PUFAs increases colonic n-3 fatty acids,
      attenuates the inflammatory response, and lowers colonic damage. High dietary n-6
      PUFA intake may be an important environmental modifier that contributes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Refractory celiac disease and sprue-like intestinal disease.
PG  - 828-30
AB  - Celiac disease is a gluten-dependent small intestinal mucosal disorder that
      causes malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis is based on 
      detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel, followed by
      evidence for an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Refractoriness in
      celiac disease may be due to poor diet compliance, sometimes intentional, or
      consumption of ubiquitious sources of gluten. Alternatively, the original
      diagnosis may not be correct (eg., duodenal Crohn's disease), or a second cause
      for symptoms may be present (eg., collagenous colitis, functional bowel
      disorder). In some with recurrent symptoms, a complication may be present (eg.,
      collagenous sprue, small bowel carcinoma, lymphoma). In some, a response to a
      gluten-free diet can not be unequivocally defined, and more precise historical
      terms have been used including "sprue-like intestinal disease" or "unclassified
      sprue". Although a "wastebasket diagnosis", these likely represent a
      heterogeneous group, and some, but not all, may develop lymphoma. Precise
      definition will be critical in the future as an array of new treatments,
      including biological agents, may emerge.

TI  - Treatment of diarrhea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: concepts and
      cautions.
PG  - S3-10
AB  - Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that
      physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient
      symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status.
      Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity
      of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as
      medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile).
      When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using
      appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other 
      medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures 
      of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For 
      iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and
      individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same;
      therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. 
      Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with
      known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or 
      abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and
      atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.

TI  - A practical approach to treating patients with chronic diarrhea.
PG  - S19-26
AB  - Although diarrhea is a common complaint, its evaluation and treatment can be
      challenging. Appropriately defining and classifying diarrhea provide the
      framework for approaching diagnostic and therapeutic options. Diarrhea can be
      defined based on frequency, consistency, and/or weight, and classified as acute
      or chronic with specific clinical characteristics and stool appearance.
      Colonoscopy is the most common diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of patients
      with chronic diarrhea. Other evaluation strategies include timed stool
      collections, evaluation of inflammatory markers, and hydrogen breath tests. A
      focused workup of chronic diarrhea may yield a specific diagnosis, including
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (dIBS), functional diarrhea, diabetic diarrhea, bile
      acid-induced diarrhea, and microscopic colitis. Ideally, therapeutic decisions
      are specifically tailored to target the underlying pathophysiology, including,
      for example, gluten restriction for celiac disease, rotating antibiotics for
      small bowel bacterial overgrowth, budesonide therapy for collagenous colitis, and
      loperamide for treatment of functional diarrhea. It is also important to assess
      the role of diet and medications in chronic diarrhea. However, if no specific
      causes are identified following workup, empiric therapy with simple opiate
      antidiarrheals such as loperamide may be effective. If this proves unsuccessful, 
      the use of more potent agents, including codeine and opium, may be considered.

TI  - Long-term effects on diet after proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 353-7; discussion 357
LID - 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.12.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) often report dietary
      intolerances. Our aim was to assess the effects of proctocolectomy (PC) for UC on
      dietary intolerances. METHODS: A novel disease-specific questionnaire was used.
      RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of patients reported 338 dietary intolerances. Of
      225 preoperative dietary intolerances, 151 (67%) resolved/improved, 56 (25%) were
      unchanged, and 18 (8%) were exacerbated after PC. A total of 113 dietary
      intolerances developed only after PC. The incidence of specific dietary
      intolerances in patients 10 years and older post-PC was similar to patients
      younger than 10 years post-PC except for a lower incidence of caffeinated
      beverage (P = .01) dietary intolerances 10 years or more post-PC. Intestinal
      symptoms, bowel function, and activities of daily living largely improved after
      PC. Extraintestinal UC symptoms worsened or failed to improve in 74%.
      CONCLUSIONS: PC for UC frequently improves preoperative dietary intolerances.
      Some patients, however, are at risk for onset of new dietary intolerances after
      PC. Studies examining traditional symptoms in UC patients pre-PC and post-PC may 
      be enhanced by examining effects on specific dietary intolerances.

TI  - Review article: nitric oxide from dysbiotic bacterial respiration of nitrate in
      the pathogenesis and as a target for therapy of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 531-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03612.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Factors initiating human ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown.
      Dysbiosis of bacteria has been hypothesized to initiate UC but, to date, neither 
      the nature of the dysbiosis nor mucosal breakdown has been explained. AIM: To
      assess whether a dysbiosis of anaerobic nitrate respiration could explain the
      microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of UC.
      METHODS: Published results in the gastroenterological, biochemical and
      microbiological literature were reviewed concerning colonocytes, nitrate
      respiration and nitric oxide in the colon in health and UC. A best-fit
      explanation of results was made regarding the pathogenesis and new treatments of 
      UC. RESULTS: Anaerobic nitrate respiration yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and 
      nitrous oxide. Colonic bacteria produce NO and UC in remission has a higher
      lumenal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide, but not NO alone, impairs 
      beta-oxidation, lipid and protein synthesis explaining the membrane, tight
      junctional and ion channel changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The
      observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics
      and antibiotics useful in treating UC. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged production of
      bacterial NO with sulphide can explain the initiation and barrier breakdown,
      which is central to the pathogenesis of UC. Therapies to alter bacterial nitrate 
      respiration and NO production need to evolve. The production of NO by colonic
      bacteria and that of the mucosa need to be separated to pinpoint the sequential
      nature of NO damage in UC.

TI  - [Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy. Results from the Texas Endosurgery Institute].
PG  - 443-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy is currently and progressively gaining acceptance for the
      management of colorectal disease. More bleeding and longer operating time were
      initially considered as contraindications to perform laparoscopic colon
      resections. Other obstacles were technical difficulties, the learning curve and
      the need for specialized instruments; however, improvements in surgical
      techniques and technological developments have allowed subtotal laparoscopic
      colectomy to be feasible. METHODS: This was a retrospective and descriptive study
      conducted from April 1992 to July 2006. Forty-four patients underwent
      laparoscopic subtotal colectomy at Texas Endosurgery Institute in San Antonio,
      TX. Measured variables to evaluate efficacy and safety were operating time,
      length of hospital stay, time to resume normal diet, conversion to open
      procedure, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Cancer, familial adenomatous
      polyposis and ulcerative colitis were the main surgical indications. The
      procedure was technically successful in 88% of patients. There were five
      conversions (11.3%). Mean operating time was 210 min. Morbidity and mortality
      rates were 29% and 2.2%, respectively. Mean length of hospital stay and time to
      resume normal diet were 11 and 4 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic
      subtotal colectomy in our institute may be considered as an effective and safe
      method in the management of colorectal disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects
      for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND 
      METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in
      gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases.
      RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular
      probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
      rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for
      irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's
      disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these
      patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies
      that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required.
      The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human
      trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation
      of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may
      have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the
      functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select
      disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed
      placebo-controlled studies.

TI  - Dietary intake and body composition of Japanese ulcerative colitis patients in
      remission.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study (N=26) was to investigate dietary intake and body
      composition and problems associated with dietary intake (such as unnecessary
      dietary restriction) in Japanese patients in remission from ulcerative colitis.
      Findings revealed the macronutrient intake and dietary fiber (absolute amount)
      were lower than the national average in men, but this may have been due to
      differences in the methods used to measure dietary intake. Although the fat
      intake (%E) of ulcerative colitis patients in this study was similar to that of
      the Japanese population, it differed greatly from that of people in Western
      countries. No significant differences in weight, height, or body mass index were 
      found when comparing the sample of individuals living with ulcerative colitis
      with the general Japanese population. Seventeen patients (65.4%) reported being
      cautious about what they ate even though in remission, and 6 patients were even
      more cautious about what they ate now than they had been in the past. The authors
      suggest further research to clarify the problems that unnecessary dietary
      restriction cause for ulcerative colitis patients who are in remission.

TI  - Prebiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - S85-9
AB  - In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response
      against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal 
      mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The 
      information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the
      origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and
      commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the
      gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics 
      are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that
      are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the 
      gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and
      oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth 
      of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with 
      reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental
      evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an
      opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been
      obtained in preliminary clinical trials.

TI  - Restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis: impact on lipid metabolism
      and adipose tissue and serum fatty acids.
PG  - 279-87
AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the changes of the metabolism
      of circulating and storage lipids in patients with ulcerative colitis after
      restorative proctocolectomy. Fifteen consecutive patients and 15 sex- and
      age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Disease activity, diet, inflammatory 
      parameters, plasma lipoprotein concentrations, and fatty acids (FA) of serum
      phospholipids and of the subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed at colectomy
      and at ileostomy closure. In ulcerative colitis patients, total cholesterol and
      docosahexaenoic acid were lower than in healthy subjects (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05).
      The median interval between colectomy and ileostomy closure was 6 (range 2-9)
      months. During that interval, the inflammatory parameters improved, high-density 
      lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol increased (p < 0.01), and low-density (LDL)
      cholesterol decreased (p = 0.01). At ileostomy closure, serum arachidonic acid
      levels were increased (p = 0.04), whereas serum oleic acid level was decreased (p
      = 0.02). In this interval, no significant alteration, either in serum n-3 FA
      precursors or in the FA of subcutaneous adipose tissue, was observed. The
      increase of serum arachidonic acid after colectomy might suggest a lower
      utilization for inflammatory process. The reduction of LDL cholesterol is an
      index of malabsorption probably due to the accelerated transit and to the
      exclusion of the terminal ileum caused by the covering ileostomy.

TI  - Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's rectosigmoidectomy.
PG  - 81-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of laparoscopic
      restoration of bowel continuity post Hartmann's procedure. METHOD: A
      prospectively electronic database of colorectal laparoscopic procedures between
      April 2001 and December 2006 has been used to identify surgical outcomes in 28
      consecutive patients who have undergone laparoscopic reversal of an open
      Hartmann's procedure (LRH). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (11 males), median age
      66 (32-89), median body mass index 26 have undergone an attempted LRH over a
      5-year period. Twenty (71%) had undergone surgery for complicated diverticulitis,
      eight (29%) for cancer; two followed an anastomotic dehiscence post-laparoscopic 
      high anterior resection. The median operation time was 80 min (40-255 min).
      Twenty-six procedures (93%) were completed laparoscopically. There was one late
      conversion (to release a small bowel loop from the pelvis). A small, fibrotic
      rectal stump split whilst attempting a stapled anastomosis - the procedure was
      abandoned. The median time to normal diet was 18 h and median hospital stay was 3
      days (1-63). There were three (11%) readmissions; wound infection (two) and
      abdominal pain. There were two deaths (7%) - mesenteric emboli and anticoagulant 
      induced upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that in the
      hands of appropriately trained and experienced surgeons, laparoscopic 'reversal' 
      of a Hartmann's procedure is a feasible, safe and largely predictive operation
      that allows for early return of gastrointestinal function and very early hospital
      discharge.

TI  - Probiotics for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD005573
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition affecting the
      colon with an incidence of approximately 10-20 per 100,000 per year. No existing 
      intervention is effective in all patients with a proportion requiring colectomy. 
      There are significant proportion of patients who experience adverse effects with 
      current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are
      constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may 
      beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing
      gut barrier function and improving local immune response. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment
      (5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of
      remission in active ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search
      for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was carried out using MEDLINE
      (1966-January 2006), EMBASE (January 1985- 2006) and CENTRAL. The Cochrane
      IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar was also searched. The
      Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Latin
      American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information
      Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine
      (JICST-E) were also used to identify abstracts. Conference proceedings from the
      Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Digestive
      Disease week were hand-searched. Authors of relevant studies and drug companies
      were contacted regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to
      the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating the
      effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments in the induction of
      remission of active ulcerative colitis DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors 
      independently assessed trial quality and extracted data for analysis. Data were
      analysed using RevMan 4.2.7. A formal meta-analysis was not preformed due to
      differences in probiotics, outcomes and trial methodology. MAIN RESULTS: None of 
      the included studies reported any statistically significant differences in
      remission or clinical improvement rates between probiotic and placebo or active
      comparator groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Conventional therapy combined with a
      probiotic does not improve overall remission rates in patients with mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis. However, there is limited evidence that probiotics
      added to standard therapy may provide modest benefits in terms of reduction of
      disease activity in patients with mild to moderately severe ulcerative colitis.
      Whether probiotics are as effective in patients with severe and more extensive
      disease and whether they can be used as an alternative to existing therapies is
      unknown. Further well designed, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to
      determine whether probiotics can be used as an alternative to current treatment
      modalities.

TI  - [Enteral nutrition in the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases (according to
      materials of the European Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition)].
PG  - 92-8, 129
AB  - The present article gives evidence-based recommendations for the indication,
      application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral nutrition
      supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC), short bowel syndrome (SBS), acute and chronic
      pancreatitis, alcoholic steatogepatitis and cirrosis. ONS and/or TF in addition
      to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve
      nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and
      should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with
      corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in
      the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF.
      In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In
      patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be
      changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special
      nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate 
      acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and
      should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment 
      in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient
      deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management 
      of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients
      with liver disease.

TI  - Laparoscopic emergency and elective surgery for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 373-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse surgical outcomes of fulminate and medically resistant
      ulcerative colitis (UC) carried out laparoscopically. METHOD: A prospective
      database identified 69 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for UC under
      the senior author over a 5-year period to April 2006. RESULTS: Thirty-two
      patients (18 male patients), median BMI 26, underwent laparoscopic subtotal
      colectomy (LSTC): 22 acute emergencies, 10 refractory to medical therapy and
      unfit for restorative proctocolectomy. All were receiving iv steroids;
      azathioprine (7), cyclosporin (5). The median operation time was 135 min
      (65-280). There was one conversion. Twenty-nine patients have subsequently
      undergone completion proctectomy and W-pouch formation [24 patients were
      performed laparoscopically - laparoscopic completion proctectomy (LCP)];
      widespread adhesions precluded in five patients. Twenty-six patients underwent
      restorative laparoscopic proctocolectomy (LRP) - one conversion. Twenty patients 
      underwent W-pouch reconstruction via a Pfannenstiel incision. Six J-pouches were 
      constructed and returned via the ileostomy site. Three underwent a laparoscopic
      pan-proctocolectomy (LPPC); one conversion. Eight patients underwent open STC.
      The median time to normal diet was 48 h (1-7 days) for LSTC/LCP and 36 h (1-5
      days) for LRP. There were two major complications following LRP, two following
      LSTC, one following LCP, one following LPPC and five following open surgery.
      Median hospital stay was 8 days (6-72) for LSTC, 7 days (6-9) for LCP and 5 days 
      (3-45) for LRP. There were six 30-day readmissions following laparoscopic surgery
      (DVT, reactive depression, ileostomy hold up (2), abdominal pain and high output 
      ileostomy). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic subtotal and restorative proctocolectomies
      in fulminate and medically resistant UC are feasible, safe and largely
      predictable operations that allow for early hospital discharge. Laparoscopic
      colectomy facilitates subsequent proctectomy and pouch construction.

TI  - [Colectomy management].
PG  - 135-44
AB  - Colorectal surgery is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures on
      the gastrointestinal tract. The large bowel plays an important role in
      maintaining water and electrolyte balance due to its high capacity of water
      absorption that may be altered with surgery. Artificial nutritional support
      should be administered, whenever possible, and is well managed with through the
      enteral route. PN is indicated only at post-surgery when there are major
      complications associated with intestinal failure. Early post-surgery EN, or oral 
      supplements, seems to be beneficial. Pouchitis occurs after proctocolectomy with 
      ileoanal anastomosis with the creation of a reservoir in patients with ulcerative
      colitis, and is well managed with antibiotic therapy, steroids, and probiotics.
      The implementation of a specific nutritional support protocol allows for
      decreasing PN and shortens hospital stay.

TI  - [Probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice].
PG  - 26-34
AB  - This article revises the concepts of prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics, and
      their use in different situations of daily clinical practice. With a high level
      of evidence, it is concluded that the use of certain strains of probiotics
      significantly reduces the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Although further 
      studies are needed, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in people
      suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis, and
      pouchitis) might improve the rates of remission induction/maintenance. The
      administration of probiotics and symbiotics to patients with liver transplant,
      severe acute pancreatitis, and intensive and surgical care patients, emerges as a
      promising therapeutic option that seems to reduce the number of infections;
      however, it is currently no possible to establish evidence-based recommendations,
      with a need for a higher number of better designed works. About safety of
      probiotics and symbiotics, the benefits/risks ratio clearly favors the former
      since the risk for infection is low, even in immunosuppressed patients. There
      are, however, selected groups of patients in which caution is advised.

TI  - A case of sequential development of celiac disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 463-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 65-year-old white female who presented with flatulence and weight
      loss was investigated by celiac antibody testing, esophagogastroduodenoscopy,
      duodenal biopsy and colonoscopy. There were no positive findings, except for
      diverticulosis. Almost 5 years later repeat investigations performed in response 
      to the patient's anemia confirmed the development of celiac disease. After 18
      months of symptom improvement as a result of gluten exclusion the patient
      developed diarrhea, and colonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis. INVESTIGATIONS: 
      Physical examination; analysis of full blood count; measurement of serum
      ferritin, vitamin B(12), folate and C-reactive protein levels; thyroid and
      autoantibody profiling (including analysis of endomysial and tissue
      transglutaminase antibodies); CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis; and
      performance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, push enteroscopy, colonoscopy and
      wireless capsule endoscopy. DIAGNOSIS: Celiac disease and ulcerative colitis.
      MANAGEMENT: Gluten-free diet, mesalazine and prednisolone.

TI  - Dietary intake, neutrophil fatty acid profile, serum antioxidant vitamins and
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of
      ulcerative colitis. Several studies suggest an association between dietary
      factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have
      examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative
      capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary 
      therapy for ulcerative colitis. Dietary intake, fatty acid composition of
      phospholipids in plasma and neutrophils, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels, and
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity were analyzed in 29 ulcerative colitis
      patients (7 males and 22 females), who were treated at the Department of
      Gastroenterology, Okayama University Hospital. Total fat intake, fat energy ratio
      and linoleic acid intake were significantly lower, while protein and carbohydrate
      intakes were significantly higher, in the patients than age- and sex-matched
      controls. In the neutrophil phospholipids of ulcerative colitis patients,
      significantly higher levels of linoleic aicd and arachidonic acid and a lower
      level of eicosapentaenoic acid were observed. The concentrations of serum retinol
      and beta-carotene but not alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower and serum
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity was also lower than in the controls.
      Significant correlations between serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity and
      retinol (r = 0.567, p = 0.0031), alpha-tocopherol (r = 0.560, p = 0.0036) and
      beta-carotene (r = 0.440, p = 0.0279) concentrations were observed in the
      ulcerative colitis patients. A diet restricting the intake of linoleic acid and
      supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidative vitamins may be
      recommendable for the nutritional management of ulcerative colitis patients.

TI  - The flavonoid luteolin worsens chemical-induced colitis in NF-kappaB(EGFP)
      transgenic mice through blockade of NF-kappaB-dependent protective molecules.
PG  - e596
AB  - BACKGROUND: The flavonoid luteolin has anti-inflammatory properties both in vivo 
      and in vitro. However, the impact of luteolin on experimental models of colitis
      is unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address the therapeutic impact of 
      luteolin, NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice were fed a chow diet containing 2%
      luteolin- or isoflavone-free control chow (AIN-76), and acute colitis was induced
      using 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Additionally, development of spontaneous
      colitis was evaluated in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice fed 2%
      luteolin chow diet or control chow diet. Interestingly, NF-kappaB(EGFP)
      transgenic mice exposed to luteolin showed worse DSS-induced colitis (weight
      loss, histological scores) compared to control-fed mice, whereas spontaneous
      colitis in IL-10(-/-);NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice was significantly attenuated.
      Macroscopic imaging of live resected colon showed enhanced EGFP expression
      (NF-kappaB activity) in luteolin-fed mice as compared to control-fed animals
      after DSS exposure, while cecal EGFP expression was attenuated in luteolin-fed
      IL-10(-/-) mice. Interestingly, confocal microscopy showed that EGFP positive
      cells were mostly located in the lamina propria and not in the epithelium.
      Caspase 3 activation was significantly enhanced whereas COX-2 gene expression was
      reduced in luteolin-fed, DSS-exposed NF-kappaB(EGFP) transgenic mice as assessed 
      by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro, luteolin sensitized
      colonic epithelial HT29 cells to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, caspase 3
      activation, DNA fragmentation and reduced TNFalpha-induced C-IAP1, C-IAP2 and
      COX-2 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that while luteolin 
      shows beneficial effects on spontaneous colitis, it aggravates DSS-induced
      experimental colitis by blocking NF-kappaB-dependent protective molecules in
      enterocytes.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of probiotic yogurt in inflammatory bowel disease
      patients.
PG  - 470-9
AB  - Our aim was to assess anti-inflammatory effects on the peripheral blood of
      subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who consumed probiotic yogurt for 
      1 month. We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had 
      Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30
      days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high))
      and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by
      flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without 
      ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells
      increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence
      interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after 
      treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC
      decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients.
      Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells
      from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+)
      CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha-
      or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was
      confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the 
      probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant
      anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of
      putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.

TI  - Educational clinical case series for pediatric allergy and immunology: allergic
      proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome and allergic
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis with protein-losing gastroenteropathy as
      manifestations of non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy.
PG  - 360-7
AB  - Cow's milk protein allergy is the most common food allergy in infants and young
      children. It is estimated that up to 50% of pediatric cow's milk allergy is
      non-IgE-mediated. Allergic proctocolitis is a benign disorder manifesting with
      blood-streaked stools in otherwise healthy-appearing infants who are breast- or
      formula-fed. Symptoms resolve within 48-72 h following elimination of dietary
      cow's milk protein. Most infants tolerate cow's milk by their first birthday.
      Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome presents in young formula-fed infants
      with chronic emesis, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Reintroduction of cow's
      milk protein following a period of avoidance results in profuse, repetitive
      emesis within 2-3 h following ingestion; 20% of acute exposures may be associated
      with hypovolemic shock. Treatment of acute reactions is with vigorous hydration. 
      Most children become tolerant with age; attempts of re-introduction of milk must 
      be done under physician supervision and with secure i.v. access. Allergic
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis affects infants as well as older children and
      adolescents. Abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, failure to thrive, or weight loss 
      are the most common symptoms. A subset of patients may develop protein-losing
      enteropathy. Fifty percent of affected children are atopic and have evidence of
      food-specific IgE antibody but skin prick tests and serum food-IgE levels
      correlate with response to elimination diet poorly. Elemental diet based on the
      amino-acid formula leads to resolutions of gastrointestinal eosinophilic
      inflammation typically within 6 wk.

TI  - Budesonide in the treatment of refractory celiac disease.
PG  - 2265-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Corticosteroids are used in patients with refractory celiac disease.
      In order to minimize their systemic side effects, we assessed the role of a
      locally active sustained release corticosteroid with minimal systemic
      bioavailability in patients with refractory celiac disease in an open labeled
      noncontrolled study. METHODS: Patients who received budesonide for refractory
      celiac disease were classified according to whether they were primarily or
      secondarily unresponsive to the diet, and whether they had a polyclonal (type I) 
      or clonal (type II) expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The response to
      budesonide was assessed globally and by reduction in bowel movements. RESULTS:
      Patients (N = 29, 72% female) received budesonide for a mean of 6.7 +/- 8.5
      months, 5 patients (18%) had type II disease (clonal T-cell population); 76%
      responded to the medication, 55% completely. Response occurred when budesonide
      was used alone or with oral corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. There was an
      objective improvement in the number of bowel movements in those that responded.
      Response occurred in those with either primary or secondary refractory disease
      and in those with type II disease, irrespective of the presence of microscopic
      colitis (N = 7). There was no improvement in the duodenal biopsy over the study
      period and there were no side effects of budesonide. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may 
      be of value in the management of refractory celiac disease.

TI  - Whole-grain consumption is associated with a reduced risk of noncardiovascular,
      noncancer death attributed to inflammatory diseases in the Iowa Women's Health
      Study.
PG  - 1606-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that oxidative stress, infection, and
      inflammation are predominant pathophysiologic factors for several major diseases.
      OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of whole-grain intake with death
      attributed to noncardiovascular, noncancer inflammatory diseases. DESIGN:
      Postmenopausal women (n = 41 836) aged 55-69 y at baseline in 1986 were followed 
      for 17 y. After exclusions for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, colitis,
      and liver cirrhosis at baseline, 27 312 participants remained, of whom 5552 died 
      during the 17 y. A proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for age,
      smoking, adiposity, education, physical activity, and other dietary factors.
      RESULTS: Inflammation-related death was inversely associated with whole-grain
      intake. Compared with the hazard ratios in women who rarely or never ate
      whole-grain foods, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.83) for those who
      consumed 4-7 servings/wk, 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) for 7.5-10.5 servings/wk, 0.64 (0.53,
      0.79) for 11-18.5 servings/wk, and 0.66 (0.54, 0.81) for >or=19 servings/wk (P
      for trend = 0.01). Previously reported inverse associations of whole-grain intake
      with total and coronary heart disease mortality persisted after 17 y of
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in inflammatory mortality associated with
      habitual whole-grain intake was larger than that previously reported for coronary
      heart disease and diabetes. Because a variety of phytochemicals are found in
      whole grains that may directly or indirectly inhibit oxidative stress, and
      because oxidative stress is an inevitable consequence of inflammation, we suggest
      that oxidative stress reduction by constituents of whole grain is a likely
      mechanism for the protective effect.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and
      treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are
      often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas
      others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness.
      Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and
      inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal 
      care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light 
      on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including
      fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in
      the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins
      and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of
      oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update
      discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient 
      deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory
      bowel disease.

TI  - Dietary supplementation with beta-glucan enriched oat bran increases faecal
      concentration of carboxylic acids in healthy subjects.
PG  - 978-84
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been 
      suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon
      cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the
      concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food
      products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy 
      subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the 
      concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Twenty-five healthy subjects (age 24+/-1.3) were recruited to the study. The
      subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 
      20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during
      three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. RESULTS: The
      concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was
      higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values 
      at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05). After 12 weeks, the
      concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and
      that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable,
      whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran
      increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased 
      concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids
      increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a
      preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.

PG  - 70-2
AB  - Collagenous sprue (CS) is a rare disease of the small bowel, which is
      characterized by complete atrophy of mucosal villi and excessive subepithelial
      collagen deposition. The authors describe a 40-year-old patient, who was examined
      for severe malabsorption syndrome. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based upon
      serological and histological data, but gluten-free diet was not effective and
      only treatment with prednisolone led to positive changes. Another histologic
      study revealed a focal deposit of collagen under the epithelium in addition to
      signs of intestinal mucosal atrophy, and the diagnosis of CS was made. The case
      is discussed from the positions of known information of CS.

AB  - Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for
      this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate 
      drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is
      impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for
      reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. 
      Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory 
      proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify
      treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral
      hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low
      doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists
      (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists
      (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis
      and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy,
      relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a
      possible treatment in the future.

TI  - A new iron free treatment with oral fish cartilage polysaccharide for iron
      deficiency chronic anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases: a pilot study.
PG  - 1575-8
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of a new oral preparation, highly concentrated in 
      fish cartilage, in a group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients with
      chronic iron deficient anemia. METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we
      supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with Crohn's disease and 14 with
      ulcerative colitis) in stable clinical conditions and chronic anemia with a food 
      supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of
      fish cartilage glycosaminoglycans and a mixture of antioxidants (Captafer
      Medestea, Turin, Italy). Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for 
      at least 4 mo. Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit. At
      time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined.
      Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test. RESULTS: Three patients relapsed
      during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to
      follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning). 
      Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase
      within the 2nd mo of treatment, P < 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and hemoglobin 
      needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P <
      0.05. The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients.
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with
      iron deficiency chronic anemia and warrant further larger controlled studies.

TI  - Oral oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation in acute ulcerative colitis is
      well tolerated and associated with lowered faecal calprotectin.
PG  - 1061-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inulin and oligofructose promote selective growth of saccharolytic
      bacteria with low inflammatory potential. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of
      oligofructose-enriched inulin in patients with active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, placebo controlled pilot trial. Eligible patients had
      been previously in remission with mesalazine as maintenance therapy or no drug,
      and presented with a relapse of mild to moderate activity. They were treated with
      mesalazine (3 g/day) and randomly allocated to receive either
      oligofructose-enriched inulin (12 g/day, p.o., n = 10) or placebo (12 g/day of
      maltodextrin, p.o., n = 9) for 2 week. Primary endpoint was the anti-inflammatory
      effect as determined by reduction of calprotectin and human DNA in faeces.
      RESULTS: Rachmilewitz score decreased in both groups, reaching statistical
      significance at day 14 (P < 0.05). Oligofructose-enriched inulin was
      well-tolerated and dyspeptic symptoms scale decreased significantly with active
      treatment but not with placebo. At day 7, an early significant reduction of
      calprotectin was observed in the group receiving oligofructose-enriched inulin
      (day 0: 4377 +/- 659 microg/g; day 7: 1033 +/- 393 microg/g, P < 0.05) but not in
      the placebo group (day 0: 5834 +/- 1563 microg/g; day 7: 4084 +/- 1395 microg/g, 
      n.s.). Changes in faecal concentration of human DNA were not significant.
      CONCLUSION: In active ulcerative colitis, dietary supplementation with
      oligofructose-enriched inulin is well tolerated and is associated with early
      reduction in faecal calprotectin.

TI  - Dietary factors in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease activity.
PG  - 60
AB  - CONTEXT: As patients look to complementary therapies for management of their
      diseases, it is important that the physician know the effectiveness and/or lack
      of effectiveness of a variety of dietary approaches/interventions. Although the
      pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary
      factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: 
      The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various
      dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of
      evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was
      searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet,
      inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.
      Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify
      further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much
      information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in
      regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad 
      applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results
      and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising
      dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel
      disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad
      application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.

TI  - Overactivity of the intestinal endocannabinoid system in celiac disease and in
      methotrexate-treated rats.
PG  - 523-30
AB  - The endocannabinoid system is upregulated in both human inflammatory bowel
      diseases and experimental models of colitis. In this study, we investigated
      whether this upregulation is a marker also of celiac disease-induced atrophy. The
      levels of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor, of the endocannabinoids, anandamide,
      and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), and of the anti-inflammatory mediator
      palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) were analyzed in bioptic samples from the duodenal
      mucosa of celiac patients at first diagnosis assessed by the determination of
      antiendomysial antibodies and histological examination. Samples were analyzed
      during the active phase of atrophy and after remission and compared to control
      samples from non-celiac patients. The levels of anandamide and PEA were
      significantly elevated (approx. 2- and 1.8-fold, respectively) in active celiac
      patients and so were those of CB(1) receptors. Anandamide levels returned to
      normal after remission with a gluten-free diet. We also analyzed endocannabinoid 
      and PEA levels in the jejunum of rats 2, 3, and 7 days after treatment with
      methotrexate, which causes inflammatory features (assessed by histopathological
      analyses and myeloperoxidase activity) similar to those of celiac patients. In
      both muscle/serosa and mucosa layers, the levels of anandamide, 2-AG, and PEA
      peaked 3 days after treatment and returned to basal levels at remission, 7 days
      after treatment. Thus, intestinal endocannabinoid levels peak with atrophy and
      regress with remission in both celiac patients and methotrexate-treated rats. The
      latter might be used as a model to study the role of the endocannabinoid system
      in celiac disease.

TI  - Etiologies and predictors of diagnosis in nonresponsive celiac disease.
PG  - 445-50
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD) is a common problem
      affecting from 7% to 30% of celiac patients. Because NRCD comprises varied and
      potentially morbid entities, efficient and cost-effective patient care requires
      knowledge of the specific causes of this disorder. The aim of this study was to
      determine the common etiologies of NRCD in a tertiary referral center. METHODS:
      All cases of biopsy examination-proven celiac disease (CD) seen at our
      institution over the preceding 5 years were included in this study. NRCD was
      defined as a failure to respond to at least 6 months of treatment with a
      gluten-free diet or the re-emergence of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities
      typical of CD while still on treatment with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total 
      of 113 patients with NRCD meeting the earlier-described criteria were seen from a
      total of 603 patients with CD (19%), however, among patients for whom we provided
      primary specialist care the incidence of NRCD was 10% (P < .001). Gluten exposure
      was the most common cause of NRCD (36%), followed by irritable bowel syndrome
      (22%), refractory CD (10%), lactose intolerance (8%), and microscopic colitis
      (6%). The mean immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase level in the
      gluten-exposed group was 67 vs 17 U/mL (normal, <20) for other diagnoses (P <
      .05). Weight loss and male sex were highly predictive of refractory CD (P < .05
      and < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: NRCD is a common phenomenon affecting
      10%-19% of celiac patients. A limited number of etiologies account for the
      majority of cases. Clinical factors may be used to guide evaluation.

AB  - Significant changes have been observed in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was
      higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it
      became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the
      incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America
      and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing
      countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster 
      or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient
      disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and
      appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and 
      CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives
      is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet,
      perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
      pathogenesis is still controversial.

TI  - [Pre- and probiotics].
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to
      provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated
      actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological
      system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the
      scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very 
      active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut
      microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism.
      Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short
      chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are
      necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen
      bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the
      intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre-
      and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and
      probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added.
      Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of
      antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future 
      studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the
      evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies
      of adequate duration.

TI  - Telephonic management of rectal bleeding in young adults: a prospective
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 86-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of young adults referred with rectal bleeding to a
      colorectal specialist clinic have a very low risk of serious disease such as
      cancer, and a high chance of gaining symptom relief by simple dietary changes. To
      determine whether young low-risk patients with rectal bleeding can be managed
      with a structured telephonic interview and dietary advice, rather than an
      outpatient visit. METHOD: A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled
      trial was performed in two stages. Patients under 40 years with rectal bleeding
      only were offered inclusion. Part-I trial: Patients were interviewed on telephone
      by the colorectal nurse specialist (CNS) and randomized to receive dietary advice
      (Advice Group) or not (Control Group). All patients were seen in clinic 6 weeks
      later by a doctor 'blinded' to their trial status. Part-II trial: Patients were
      interviewed on telephone by the CNS and again randomized to an Advice Group or a 
      Control Group. The Control Group were seen in clinic 6 weeks later. The Advice
      Group were telephoned again 6 weeks later, and if their bleeding had stopped,
      were not brought to clinic. All patients were tracked for a year after the study 
      to ensure no adverse diagnoses came to light. RESULTS: Part-I trial: 63 of 89
      eligible patients were contactable and none refused the study. Seventy per cent
      of the Advice Group compared with 33% (P = 0.001) of the Control Group had
      symptomatic improvement when seen in clinic. Approximately 30% of each group
      required further treatment. Part-II trial: 54 of 94 eligible patients were
      contactable. However a further nine declined to enter the trial; 90% of patients 
      in the Advice Group had improved at 6 weeks as judged by telephone interview
      compared with 56% of patients in the Control Group (P = 0.024) who were seen in
      clinic. The 90% of patients who improved in the Advice Group did not need to come
      to clinic to be seen. In both parts of the trial, the CNS identified a small
      number of patients with urgent symptoms at interview and brought them to clinic. 
      The majority had anal fissures or haemorrhoids although in Part-II, one patient
      had ulcerative colitis and one had colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Telephonic
      consultation is an effective way of identifying those patients with urgent
      symptoms among a cohort of young adults referred to the hospital with rectal
      bleeding. Telephonic dietary advice leads to resolution of rectal bleeding in the
      majority of patients without urgent symptoms.

TI  - Carrageenan induces interleukin-8 production through distinct Bcl10 pathway in
      normal human colonic epithelial cells.
PG  - G829-38
AB  - Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the 
      texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last
      half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in
      rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies 
      to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human
      intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal
      epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were
      treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1
      mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB,
      IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by
      immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, 
      nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion
      were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA
      markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the
      NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human
      intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory
      pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of
      IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to
      that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's
      disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and
      environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use
      of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical
      significance.

TI  - Respiratory symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and the impact
      of dietary salicylates.
PG  - 232-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms are over-represented in inflammatory bowel
      disease. There are similarities between the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease and that of respiratory conditions for which an adverse influence of
      salicylate has been identified. Natural salicylates exist within our diet. AIMS: 
      To determine whether a lower intake of dietary salicylates is associated with
      less active inflammatory bowel disease and fewer concurrent respiratory symptoms.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respiratory status, inflammatory bowel disease activity,
      quality of life, and dietary habits were established in 73 patients with Crohn's 
      disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, using a self-administered questionnaire
      and peak expiratory flow rate readings. Harvey-Bradshaw and Simple
      Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis indices, an internally validated respiratory score,
      and estimated weekly dietary salicylate intake, were calculated for each patient.
      RESULTS: There was at least one respiratory symptom in 63.4% of patients. The
      commonest underlying respiratory diagnosis was asthma. Respiratory impairment was
      similar in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; 56.3% of Crohn's disease
      patients with an active respiratory diagnosis had other extra-intestinal
      manifestations. The dietary salicylate intake was independent of respiratory
      status, but inversely correlated with ulcerative colitis activity (dietary
      salicylate intake 37.0mg versus 21.4mg for low and higher Simple Birmingham/Royal
      Free Colitis index, respectively; p<0.02). A similar association was not seen in 
      Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory impairment is common in inflammatory
      bowel disease. Higher intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less
      active colitis and possibly causally so.

TI  - Combination therapy using fexofenadine, disodium cromoglycate, and a
      hypoallergenic amino acid-based formula induced remission in a patient with
      steroid-dependent, chronically active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 833-9
AB  - Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid are the primary standard therapy for
      inflammatory bowel disease. Recent immunologic data implicate an involvement of
      mast cell activation followed by increased histamine secretion and elevated
      tissue concentrations of histamine in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. In 
      the present case, the clinical course of a 35-year-old man with steroid-dependent
      chronic active ulcerative colitis, who did not respond to high-dose steroids,
      antibiotics, or azathioprine during 3 years, is reported. Clinical disease
      activity and established serological markers were recorded during 6 weeks of
      unsuccessful therapy and during the next 6 weeks, as a new nonsedative
      antihistaminergic drug, a mast cell stabilizer, and an hypoallergenic diet were
      implemented in addition to conventional therapy. Induction of remission was
      achieved within 2 weeks after treatment with fexofenadine, disodium cromoglycate,
      and an amino acid-based formula. Clinical disease activity, stool frequency,
      leukocytes, c-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels in serum decreased
      rapidly. Daily steroid administration could be gradually reduced along with 6
      weeks of this treatment. This report suggests that histamine and mast cell
      activity may be important pathophysiological factors responsible for persistent
      clinical and mucosal inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis despite the use 
      of steroids. In ulcerative colitis, patients unresponsive to conventional
      treatment, therapeutic considerations should also include an antiallergic
      approach when further signs of atopy or intestinal hypersensitivity are present.
