TI  - [Increased IgE-type antibody response to food allergens in irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 797-802
AB  - BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed
      defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively
      referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from
      dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the
      components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of 
      IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the 
      most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies
      against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and
      IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a
      healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency
      of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of
      the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food
      allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the
      immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control
      group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk
      protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of
      food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group,
      the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of 
      food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of
      this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a 
      diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate
      which is useful therapy in food allergy.

PG  - 895-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional status and dietary habits of Lithuanian
      patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and to compare with those of
      healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in
      the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A
      total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178
      healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report
      questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in
      primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was
      calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no
      statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning
      consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white 
      bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed 
      fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's 
      disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and
      patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body 
      mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower
      compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower
      body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls.
      Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less 
      frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided
      with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.

TI  - Carrageenan induces interleukin-8 production through distinct Bcl10 pathway in
      normal human colonic epithelial cells.
PG  - G829-38
AB  - Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the 
      texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last
      half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in
      rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies 
      to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human
      intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal
      epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were
      treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1
      mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB,
      IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by
      immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, 
      nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion
      were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA
      markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the
      NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human
      intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory
      pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of
      IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to
      that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's
      disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and
      environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use
      of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical
      significance.

TI  - Escherichia coli: on-farm contamination of animals.
PG  - 555-69
AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the main inhabitants of the intestinal tract of most
      mammalian species, including humans, and birds. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
      (STEC), also called verotoxinogenic E. coli, usually do not cause disease in
      animals but may cause watery diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis, and/or haemolytic
      uraemic syndrome in humans. Zoonotic STEC include the O157:H7 strains and, with
      increasing frequency, certain non-O157 strains. The importance of non-O157
      zoonotic strains is probably underestimated as they have been less well
      characterised and are more difficult to detect in samples than O157:H7. Another
      large subset of STEC strains has been isolated from animals but has not, at the
      present time, been associated with disease in animals or humans. Cattle and other
      ruminants are the most important reservoir of zoonotic STEC, which are
      transmitted to humans through the ingestion of foods or water contaminated with
      animal faeces, or through direct contact with the infected animals or their
      environment. The main sources of STEC infection of cattle on-farm are the
      drinking water, the feed, and the immediate environment of the animal. Risk
      factors that have been identified for infection of animals with O157 STEC include
      age, weaning, movement of the animals, season, feed composition, and the ability 
      of the bacteria to persist in the environment. On-farm control of the zoonotic
      risk of human infection with STEC should primarily target the main source of
      contamination: the animal reservoir. Various strategies to reduce intestinal
      colonisation of cattle by zoonotic STEC have been tried with varying results,
      including vaccination, treatment with probiotics, such as direct-fed microbials
      or competitive exclusion, administration of bacteriophages, and modification of
      the diet.

TI  - What is the origin of ulcerative colitis? Still more questions than answers.
PG  - 620-5
AB  - Despite more than a century of existence as a clinical entity, the true origin of
      ulcerative colitis still remains elusive. Several factors probably contribute to 
      the development of this condition. Recently discovered technologies have
      clarified the role of bacterial species, which may account for intestinal
      dysbiosis, as a factor triggering ulcerative colitis. Genetic susceptibility
      together with abnormal innate immunoreactivity probably comprise the essential
      prerequisites for the initiation and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis. Although
      the genetic background has been more clearly recognised in patients with Crohn's 
      disease than in those with ulcerative colitis, some candidate loci associated
      with ulcerative colitis have also been intensively studied. Additionally,
      environmental factors may interfere with inherent predispositions to ulcerative
      colitis, and either suppress or reinforce them. Whatever the origin, the search
      for the aetiology of ulcerative colitis must have the same goal: the improvement 
      of treatment and the quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Microscopic colitis are defined as a chronic inflammation of a normal macroscopic
      colonic mucosa. We report 20 cases of microscopic colitis. Chronic diarrhea
      revealed the diagnosis in 95% of cases. Endoscopic examination was normal in 95% 
      of patients. We diagnosed collagenous colitis in 65% of cases and lymphocytic
      colitis in 35% of cases. The treatment was based on sulphasalazine in 16
      patients, on 5 aminosalicylic acid in 1 case, on gluten free diet in 2 cases and 
      a symptomatic treatment was prescribed to one patient. A clinical remission was
      observed in 41.2% of patients taking sulphasalazine.

TI  - Pathological analysis of lesions within intestines resected due to ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Lesniowski-Crohn's disease together
      constitute a type of intestinal pathology known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
      The etiology of UC still remains unknown, however some epidemiological data
      suggest the role of bacteria and viruses and also some habitual as well as
      environmental factors like smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and social status, 
      as well as stress. The genetic predisposition is also suggested. UC affects young
      people in 2nd - 4th decades of life. Exacerbations of the disease may result in
      the necessity of surgical treatment, typically in the form of total
      proctocolectomy accompanied by the subsequent formation of ileo-pouch-anal
      anastomosis. The aim of our study was to analyze morphological pictures of
      resected specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 67 cases (40 women and 27
      men) of UC with the special interest being focused at macro- as well as
      microscopic features of the intestines resected. We reviewed macroscopic
      characteristics of intestines (i.e. the length of resected fragments,
      localization, shape and diameter of the ulcers, polyps, number of resected lymph 
      nodes), as well as microscopic descriptions concerning, among others the
      character and localization of inflammatory infiltrate, the architecture of
      glands, the presence of crypt abscesses and Paneth's metaplasia. Special
      attention was paid to the morphology of intestinal wall vasculature. RESULTS: In 
      42% of the cases macroscopically the inflammation covered the whole length of the
      resected colon. In 58% macroscopically detected inflammatory changes were
      segmental in distribution. In four cases the disease had clinically the fulminant
      course and the inflammation was transmural. There were 3 cases, in which
      histological assessment revealed the presence of malignancy (2 cases of mucus
      producing adenocarcinoma and one case of carcinoma in situ situated in the anal
      canal). Generally, microscopic findings were typical for the active phase of UC. 
      We found intensive vascularization and hyperemia of the intestinal wall to be the
      common features accompanying the inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Young people in the
      3rd and 4th decades of life constitute the group being relatively commonly
      affected by the UC, and undergo the surgical proctocolectomy. Some of the cases
      present with the fulminant course of the disease. A rich vascular network is a
      common finding in the inflamed intestinal wall. We hypothesize, that intensive
      vascularization may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.

TI  - Environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease: a co-twin control study of a
      Swedish-Danish twin population.
PG  - 925-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetics and environmental factors are implicated in the etiology of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We studied environmental factors in a
      population-based Swedish-Danish twin cohort using the co-twin control method.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 317 twin pairs regarding
      markers of exposures in the following areas: infections/colonization and diet as 
      well as smoking, appendectomy, and oral contraceptives. Odds ratios (OR) were
      calculated by conditional logistic regression. When confounding appeared
      plausible, multivariate conditional logistic regression was added. The questions 
      were also divided into topic groups, and adjustment was made for multiple testing
      within each of the groups. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was
      83%. In consideration of the study design, only discordant pairs were included
      (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 102; ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 125). Recurrent
      gastrointestinal infections were associated with both UC (OR, 8.0; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.0-64) and CD (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.2-25). Hospitalization for
      gastrointestinal infections was associated with CD (OR, 12; 95% CI, 1.6-92).
      Smoking was inversely associated with UC (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) and
      associated with CD (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1). CONCLUSIONS: The observed
      associations indicate that markers of possible infectious events may influence
      the risk of IBD. Some of these effects might be mediated by long-term changes in 
      gut flora or alterations in reactivity to the flora. The influence of smoking in 
      IBD was confirmed.

TI  - Is there any food I can eat? Living with inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
      and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair
      quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living.
      Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the
      evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders,
      particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the
      strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning 
      coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall
      objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had
      been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome.
      This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable
      bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females,
      diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were
      recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada.
      Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires,
      e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed 
      for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means 
      by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or
      controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of
      determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of 
      stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research,
      predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates 
      the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women
      identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that
      they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health 
      nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.

TI  - Respiratory symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and the impact
      of dietary salicylates.
PG  - 232-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms are over-represented in inflammatory bowel
      disease. There are similarities between the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease and that of respiratory conditions for which an adverse influence of
      salicylate has been identified. Natural salicylates exist within our diet. AIMS: 
      To determine whether a lower intake of dietary salicylates is associated with
      less active inflammatory bowel disease and fewer concurrent respiratory symptoms.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Respiratory status, inflammatory bowel disease activity,
      quality of life, and dietary habits were established in 73 patients with Crohn's 
      disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, using a self-administered questionnaire
      and peak expiratory flow rate readings. Harvey-Bradshaw and Simple
      Birmingham/Royal Free Colitis indices, an internally validated respiratory score,
      and estimated weekly dietary salicylate intake, were calculated for each patient.
      RESULTS: There was at least one respiratory symptom in 63.4% of patients. The
      commonest underlying respiratory diagnosis was asthma. Respiratory impairment was
      similar in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; 56.3% of Crohn's disease
      patients with an active respiratory diagnosis had other extra-intestinal
      manifestations. The dietary salicylate intake was independent of respiratory
      status, but inversely correlated with ulcerative colitis activity (dietary
      salicylate intake 37.0mg versus 21.4mg for low and higher Simple Birmingham/Royal
      Free Colitis index, respectively; p<0.02). A similar association was not seen in 
      Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory impairment is common in inflammatory
      bowel disease. Higher intake of dietary salicylates is associated with less
      active colitis and possibly causally so.

TI  - Sources and severity of self-reported food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis.
PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Data on food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are scarce. The aim
      of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the
      nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and
      Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31%
      men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more
      foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea
      (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy
      foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool
      consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions,
      cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The
      urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than
      after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool
      consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates
      that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base
      their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-)
      physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.

PG  - 90-5
AB  - Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial
      bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to
      them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora
      produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous
      important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the
      colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of 
      mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear
      translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent
      anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear 
      to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use
      probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. 
      It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal
      pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts
      of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high
      degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability 
      of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and
      probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and
      pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.

TI  - Combination therapy using fexofenadine, disodium cromoglycate, and a
      hypoallergenic amino acid-based formula induced remission in a patient with
      steroid-dependent, chronically active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 833-9
AB  - Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid are the primary standard therapy for
      inflammatory bowel disease. Recent immunologic data implicate an involvement of
      mast cell activation followed by increased histamine secretion and elevated
      tissue concentrations of histamine in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. In 
      the present case, the clinical course of a 35-year-old man with steroid-dependent
      chronic active ulcerative colitis, who did not respond to high-dose steroids,
      antibiotics, or azathioprine during 3 years, is reported. Clinical disease
      activity and established serological markers were recorded during 6 weeks of
      unsuccessful therapy and during the next 6 weeks, as a new nonsedative
      antihistaminergic drug, a mast cell stabilizer, and an hypoallergenic diet were
      implemented in addition to conventional therapy. Induction of remission was
      achieved within 2 weeks after treatment with fexofenadine, disodium cromoglycate,
      and an amino acid-based formula. Clinical disease activity, stool frequency,
      leukocytes, c-reactive protein, and orosomucoid levels in serum decreased
      rapidly. Daily steroid administration could be gradually reduced along with 6
      weeks of this treatment. This report suggests that histamine and mast cell
      activity may be important pathophysiological factors responsible for persistent
      clinical and mucosal inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis despite the use 
      of steroids. In ulcerative colitis, patients unresponsive to conventional
      treatment, therapeutic considerations should also include an antiallergic
      approach when further signs of atopy or intestinal hypersensitivity are present.

TI  - Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, 
      or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore
      expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics,
      whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to
      incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for 
      prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the
      Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large 
      intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer,
      focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language.
      Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or
      meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose,
      galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large
      bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These
      carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and
      intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small.
      Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few,
      although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel
      disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early
      days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial
      balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.

TI  - Tacrolimus-associated eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis in pediatric liver
      transplant recipients: role of potential food allergies in pathogenesis.
PG  - 730-5
AB  - Tacrolimus is a macrolide agent that is now the primary immunosuppressant used in
      prevention of graft rejection in transplant recipients. It has been found to be
      superior to cyclosporine (CSA) for rescue therapy as well as for earlier weaning 
      of steroids. Both tacrolimus and CSA share similar toxicity profiles; however,
      their gastrointestinal side effects have received little attention. We report
      three cases of eosinophilic colitis in liver transplant recipients, maintained on
      tacrolimus as immunosuppressive medication post-liver transplantation. These
      patients also had high serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels, eosinophilia and
      IgE-positive radioallergosorbent test for milk proteins. The colitis appeared to 
      be mediated by food allergies. Each patient had symptomatic improvement following
      reduced immunosuppression and an appropriately restricted diet. We conclude that 
      tacrolimus may play a role in the initiation of food allergies, leading to
      eosinophilic colitis. More studies are needed in a controlled setting to identify
      the prevalence of similar findings among other pediatric liver transplant
      recipients.

TI  - [Environmental risk factors in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (excluding 
      tobacco and appendicectomy)].
PG  - 859-67
AB  - A rapid increase in the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in
      developed countries, the occurrence of Crohn's disease in spouses, and a lack of 
      complete concordance in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of
      environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Research in the field 
      of environmental factors in IBD is based upon epidemiological (geographical and
      case-control), clinical and experimental studies. The role of two environmental
      factors has clearly been established in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for Crohn's
      disease and a protective factor for ulcerative colitis; appendectomy is a
      protective factor for ulcerative colitis. Many other environmental factors for
      IBD have been investigated, including infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and 
      social status. They are detailed in the present review. Among them, atypical
      Mycobacteria, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in Crohn's
      disease. To date, three hypotheses associate environmental factors with the
      pathophysiology of IBD (loss of tolerance of intestinal immune system towards
      commensal bacterial flora): the hygiene, infection and cold chain hypotheses.
      Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. Research
      identifying environmental factors that might cause a predisposition to IBD is
      useful. It may lead to disease prevention in subjects who are genetically
      predisposed and disease improvement in patients.

TI  - Case closed? Diverticulitis: epidemiology and fiber.
PG  - S112-6
AB  - A major advance in understanding diverticular disease occurred decades ago with
      the epidemiologic association between fiber intake and the development of
      diverticular disease. This association has been well documented with
      investigations into the emergence of diverticular disease in underdeveloped
      countries where the disease had been virtually unknown before the adoption of a
      westernized diet, low in fiber. The high frequency of right-sided diverticular
      disease in Asian countries diverges from what is seen in the West. The
      physiologic effects of insoluble fiber has been well examined as well, increasing
      bulk and decreasing transit time, with a deficiency contributing to the high
      pressures implicated in the physiology which leads to diverticular disease.
      However, at most, 10% to 25% of individuals with diverticular disease will
      develop diverticulitis. Risk factors for symptomatic diverticular have been
      increasingly described in recent years with obesity and red meat intake being of 
      particular importance, in addition to age. However, the known factors poorly
      identify those at increased risk and the predisposing pathophysiology is
      incompletely understood as well. Insoluble fiber, but not soluble fiber, has been
      viewed as the principal component which has been deficient in western diets and
      is the culprit which leads to the establishment of diverticular disease and in
      turn, diverticulitis. Soluble fiber and its effect on the intestinal flora is
      proposed as having significant influence on the development of diverticulitis.
      This understanding, if demonstrated, would have important implications for the
      primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-73
AB  - Nutrition has an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. 
      This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention 
      of osteoporosis and in children the promotion of optimal growth and development. 
      In active Crohn's disease nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is
      an effective primary therapy for many patients. Corticosteroids, however, are
      more effective than enteral diet therapy in adults. Enteral diets should be
      considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease, especially in
      children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment. Enteral nutrition
      does not have a proven primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. There are 
      many theories that suggest that diet may be implicated in the aetiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease, however, there are, as yet, no dietary approaches
      proven to reduce the risk of developing IBD.

PG  - 376-82
AB  - Enteric microflora profiles vary considerably between active inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) and healthy conditions. Intestinal microflora may partake in the
      pathogenesis of IBD by one or some ways: specific pathogenic infection induces
      abnormal intestinal mucosal inflammation; aberrant microflora components trigger 
      the onset of IBD; abnormal host immune response loses normal immune tolerance to 
      luminal components; luminal antigens permeate through the defective mucosal
      barrier into mucosal lamina propria and induce abnormal inflammatory response.
      Preliminary studies suggest that administration of probiotics may be benefit for 
      experimental colitis and clinical trials for IBD. Researches have been studying
      the function of probiotics. Introduction of probiotics can balance the aberrant
      enteric microflora in IBD patients, and reinforce the various lines of intestinal
      defence by inhibiting microbial pathogens growth, increasing intestinal
      epithelial tight junction and permeability, modulating immune response of
      intestinal epithelia and mucosal immune cells, secreting antimicrobial products, 
      decomposing luminal pathogenic antigens.

TI  - High-iron diet: foe or feat in ulcerative colitis and ulcerative
      colitis-associated carcinogenesis.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - Anemia associated with long-standing chronic inflammation and iron deficiency,
      and the increased risk for the development of dysplasia and carcinoma, are two of
      the most common complications in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Because
      of iron and nutrition deficiency, UC patients are encouraged to consume a
      high-protein and high-iron diet. The crucial clinical question is the effect of a
      high-iron diet on inflammation activity and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis.
      Is a high-iron diet a foe or a feat in UC and UC-associated carcinogenesis? This 
      review updates the progress and information on (1) iron nutrition and
      iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC, (2) experimental evidence of the
      exacerbating effect of a high-iron diet on UC and its associated carcinogenesis

TI  - A population-based case control study of potential risk factors for IBD.
PG  - 993-1002
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to pursue potential etiological clues to Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) through a population-based case control survey
      study. METHODS: Cases with CD (n = 364) and UC (n = 217), ages 18-50 yr were
      drawn from the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry.
      Potential control subjects were drawn from the population-based Manitoba Health
      Registry by age, gender, and geographic residence matching to the cases (n =
      433). Subjects were administered a multiitem questionnaire. RESULTS: By
      univariate analysis, some of the variables predictive of CD included lower
      likelihood of living on a farm, of having drunk unpasteurized milk or having
      eaten pork, and UC patients were less likely to have drunk unpasteurized milk and
      to have eaten pork. On multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated 
      with CD were being Jewish (OR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.10-16.9), having a first degree
      relative with IBD (OR = 3.07, 95% CI 1.73-5.46), ever having smoked (OR = 1.54,
      95% CI, 1.06-2.25), living longer with a smoker (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04).
      Being a first generation Canadian (OR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.17-0.62), having pet cats
      before age 5 (OR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.46-0.96) and having larger families (OR =
      0.87, 95% CI, 0.79-0.96) were protective against CD. For UC being Jewish (OR =
      7.46, 95% CI, 2.33-23.89), having a relative with IBD (OR = 2.23, 95% CI,
      1.27-3.9), and ever smoking (OR = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.14-2.32) were predictive.
      CONCLUSION: This study reinforced the increased risk associated with family
      history, being Jewish, and smoking history, however, a number of significant
      associations with CD and UC on univariate and multivariate analysis may support
      the "hygiene hypothesis" and warrant further exploration in prospective studies.

TI  - Monitoring nonresponsive patients who have celiac disease.
PG  - 317-27
AB  - Because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and
      because treatment exists that is effective in most cases, screening of the
      general population for celiac disease has been considered. There is still no
      evidence that patients who have symptom-free celiac disease are at increased risk
      of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. Prevention of osteoporosis
      seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today [22]. The
      major cause of failure to respond to a gluten-free diet is continuing ingestion
      of gluten, but other underlying diseases must be considered. Many different drugs
      (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) have been used in patients who have 
      RCD [23]. Steroid treatment has been reported to be effective even in patients
      who have underlying early EATL. Histologic recovery in patients who have celiac
      disease usually takes several months but can take up to 1 year, even if the
      patient remains on a strict gluten-free diet. Some patients report celiac-related
      symptoms for months after a single gluten intake. The definitions for RCD in
      literature vary. The authors consider the definition give by Daum and colleagues 
      [24] suitable. They defined true RCD as villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia
      and increased IELs persisting for more than 12 months in spite of a strict
      gluten-free diet. If a patient is not responding well to a gluten-free diet,
      three considerations are necessary: (1) the initial diagnosis of celiac disease
      must be reassessed;(2) the patient should be sent to a dietician to check for
      errors in diet or compliance problems, because problems with the gluten-free diet
      are the most important cause for persisting symptoms; (3) other reasons for
      persisting symptoms (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome,
      bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative
      jejunitis, protein-losing enteropathy,T-cell lymphoma, fructose intolerance,
      cavitating lymphadenopathy, and tropical sprue) should be considered. Other
      causes for villous atrophy are Crohn's disease, collagenous sprue, and autoimmune
      enteropathy. Abdulkarim and colleagues [25] examined 55 patients who had a
      diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease. He found that 6 did not have celiac
      disease, and25 still had some gluten ingestion.Tursi and colleagues [26] reported
      15 patients who had celiac disease with persisting symptoms. Because histology
      improved in all patients after several months, RCD was excluded. Of the 15
      patients, 10 had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 2 showed lactose
      malabsorption causing the described symptoms, 1 had mistakenly taken an
      antibiotic containing gluten, and 1 patient each had Giardia lamblia and Ascaris 
      lumbricoides. Thus, other entities must be considered in patients who have celiac
      disease and ongoing symptoms. In a follow-up clinical trial, 158 patients who had
      celiac disease underwent follow-up small intestine biopsies within 2 years after 
      starting a gluten-free diet. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial)
      villous atrophy were considered to have RCD; 5 of them developed EATL [27].RCD
      type I is characterized by normal expression of T-cell antigens and polyclonal
      TCR gene rearrangement.RCD type II is characterized by an abnormal IEL phenotype 
      with the expression of intracytoplasmic CD3e, surface CD103, and the lack of
      classic surface T-cell markers such as CD8, CD4, and TCR-alpha/beta. This clonal 
      IEL population can be considered crypt IEL [24]. RCD II has a poor prognosis,
      which is a problem for therapy. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements and loss of T-cell
      antigens such as CD8 and TCR-beta in IELs may indicate the development of an EATL
      in patients who have RCD. The markers for an overt EATL are a positive stool
      blood test, increased lactate dehydrogenase, or beta2-microglobulin [24]. If an
      overt lymphoma is suspected, upper and lower endoscopy, an ear, nose, and throat 
      work-up, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and possibly double-balloon enteroscopy
      should be performed. Most reports of the difficulties in treating patients who
      have true RCE are casereports. Turner and colleagues [28] reported on an
      induction of remission by useof the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab and
      maintenance with prednisoloneand azathioprine. Olaussen and colleagues [29] and
      Mandal and colleagues [30]tried a nonimmunogenic elemental diet. Gillet and
      colleagues [31] reported successful treatment of a patient who hadRCD using
      anti-TNF-alpha antibodies (infliximab) for induction and azathioprinefor
      maintenance. Maurino and colleagues [32] studied seven consecutive patients
      diagnosed ashaving refractory sprue and no response to oral or parenteral
      steroids. Aftertreatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d) and oral prednisone (1
      mg/kg/d), fivepatients had a complete clinical remission. Two patients who did
      not respond totreatment at any time died. Goerres and colleagues [33] described
      18 patients who had RCD, 10 of whomhad type I RCD, and 8 of whom had type II RCD.
      Treatment consisted ofazathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year.
      Consistent with reports byother investigators, the response rates in the two
      groups differed. Eight of the10 patients who had type I RCD had a histologic
      response. Seven of the eightpatients who had type II RCD died, and six of the
      eight developed a lymphoma. At present there is no effective treatment for type
      II RCD.Fig. 3 presents a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients who have
      ce-liac disease.

TI  - Safety, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic ileal-pouch-anal
      anastomosis: a single institutional case-matched experience.
PG  - 667-70; discussion 670-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare safety and short-term outcomes of 100 laparoscopic ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) versus 200 conventional open IPAA patients. SUMMARY
      BACKGROUND DATA: Outcomes of laparoscopic IPAA (LAP-IPAA) have been incompletely 
      characterized. Previous reports are characterized by small numbers of patients
      and rarely include case-matched or randomized trial methodology. This report
      describes 100 LAP-IPAA patients case matched to 200 open IPAA patients. METHODS: 
      Between 1998 and 2004, 100 consecutive LAP-IPAA patients (75 laparoscopic
      assisted, 25 hand assisted) were identified and case matched to 200 open IPAA
      control patients by age, operation, gender, date of operation, and body mass
      index. Operative and postoperative outcomes at 90 days were compared. RESULTS: A 
      total of 300 patients (180 female) with a median age of 32 years (range, 17-66
      years), and a median body mass index of 23 kg/m (range, 16-34 kg/m) underwent
      IPAA (100 LAP-IPAA, 200 open IPAA). Diagnosis (chronic ulcerative colitis 97%,
      familial adenomatous polyposis 3%) and previous operative history were equivalent
      between groups. One intraoperative complication occurred in each group. Overall, 
      the laparoscopic conversion rate was 6%. Median operative time was longer for the
      LAP-IPAA group (333 minutes versus 230 minutes, P < 0.0001). LAP-IPAA patients
      had shorter median time to regular diet (3 versus 5 days), time to ileostomy
      output (2 versus 3 days), length of stay (4 versus 7 days), and decreased IV
      narcotic use (all P < 0.05. Postoperative morbidity was equivalent (LAP-IPAA =
      33%, open IPAA = 37%), mortality was nil, and readmission rates were equal
      (LAP-IPAA = 21%, open IPAA = 22%). Reoperation was required in 3% of LAP-IPAA and
      6.5% of open IPAA patients (P < 0.2) during the first 3 months. CONCLUSION:
      LAP-IPAA is equivalent to open IPAA in terms of safety and feasibility. In
      addition, LAP-IPAA provides significant improvements in short-term recovery
      outcomes.

TI  - Eubacterium limosum ameliorates experimental colitis and metabolite of microbe
      attenuates colonic inflammatory action with increase of mucosal integrity.
PG  - 1071-7
AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of Eubacterium limosum (E. limosum) on colonic
      epithelial cell line in vitro, and to evaluate the effect of E. limosum on
      experimental colitis. METHODS: E. limosum was inoculated anaerobically and its
      metabolites were obtained. The growth stimulatory effect of the E. limosum
      metabolites on T84 cells was evaluated by SUDH activity, and the
      anti-inflammatory effect by IL-6 production. The change in mRNA of toll like
      receptor 4 (TLR4) was evaluated by real time PCR. Colitis was induced by feeding 
      BALB/C mice with 2.0% dextran sodium sulfate. These mice received either 5%
      lyophilized E. limosum (n = 7) or control diet (n = 7). Seven days after colitis 
      induction, clinical and histological scores, colon length, and cecal organic acid
      levels were determined. RESULTS: The E. limosum produced butyrate, acetate,
      propionate, and lactate at 0.25, 1.0, 0.025 and 0.07 mmol/L, respectively in
      medium. At this concentration, each acid had no growth stimulating activity on
      T84 cells; however, when these acids were mixed together at the above levels, it 
      showed significantly high activity than control. Except for lactate, these acids 
      significantly attenuated IL-6 production at just 0.1 mmol/L. In addition, under
      TNF-alpha stimulation, butyrate attenuated the production of TLR4 mRNA. The
      treatment with E. limosum significantly attenuated clinical and histological
      scores of colitis with an increase of cecal butyrate levels, compared with the
      control group. CONCLUSION: E. limosum can ameliorate experimental colonic
      inflammation. In part, the metabolite of E. limosum, butyrate, increases mucosal 
      integrity and shows anti-inflammatory action modulation of mucosal defense system
      via TLR4.

TI  - [Allergic colitis in exclusively breast-fed infants].
PG  - 158-61
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Eosinophilic colitis is induced by antigens present in cow's milk
      proteins in formula or human milk. In the last few years, an increasing number of
      cases have been diagnosed in exclusively breast-fed infants. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 13 infants diagnosed with allergic
      colitis in our unit between January 1997 and January 2004. All the infants had
      been exclusively breast-fed. RESULTS: In all patients, initial symptoms were
      digestive (12 with mucus and bloody stools). Onset of symptoms occurred at 0-3
      months in 77 %. Laboratory data of the allergic compound were negative. The main 
      locations were the descending and sigmoid colon (75 %). Biopsy demonstrated acute
      inflammation, with neutrophil infiltration and an increase in eosinophils. In all
      patients, initial treatment consisted of exclusion of cow's milk proteins from
      the mother's diet. Ten of the 13 patients showed no improvement, requiring
      exclusive administration of protein-free hydrolyzate. In 3 infants, breastfeeding
      was maintained (breastfeeding without cow's milk proteins plus hydrolyzate).
      CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of eosinophilic colitis is based on exclusion of other
      causes of specific colitis and typical endoscopic and ultrastructural findings.
      Moreover, a satisfactory response to dietary treatment must be demonstrated. This
      diagnosis should be considered in breast-fed infants with rectal bleeding without
      involvement of general health status.

TI  - Probiotics modulate inflammatory cytokine secretion from inflamed mucosa in
      active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 284-8
AB  - Enteric microflora of ulcerative colitis patients becomes aberrant. The abnormal 
      interaction between microflora and intestinal mucosal immune system leads the
      mucosal inflammation. Probiotic administration may recover the commensal
      microflora and normalise the host-microbial interaction. In this experiment, we
      cocultured colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis patients with
      bifidobacterium to investigate the modulation effect of probiotics on inflamed
      colonic tissues and its possible mechanism. Colonic biopsies from active
      ulcerative colitis were cocultured for 24 h with Bifidobacterium longum. Tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in supernatants were measured 
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the biopsies were fixed using paraffin 
      and the expression of NF-kappaB P65 of tissues was studied using
      immunohistochemical staining. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in
      supernatants of tissues cocultured with probiotics were lower than those cultured
      alone. The number of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with nuclear
      factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) P65 positive in cocultured tissues was also decreased.
      When cocultured with inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis, probiotics
      could inhibit NF-kappaB activation in LPMC and down-regulate inflammatory
      cytokine secretion from inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Celiac disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis 
      (PSC) in one patient: a family study.
PG  - 907-13
AB  - We discuss the case of a 17-year-old male who at the age of 7 was diagnosed with 
      celiac disease (CD) together with ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary sclerosing 
      cholangitis (PSC). The patient was treated with gluten-free diet and
      immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine), and currently remains asymptomatic. The
      patient's younger, 12-year-old sister was diagnosed with CD when she was 1.5
      years old, and at 7 years she developed type-I diabetes mellitus, which was
      difficult to control. A family study was made, and both parents were found to be 
      affected with silent CD. All were DQ2 (+). In relation to the case and family
      study, we provide a series of comments related to CD and its complications.

TI  - Relationship between nutritional habits adopted by ulcerative colitis relevant to
      cancer development patients at clinical remission stages and molecular-genetic
      parameters.
PG  - 188-95
AB  - UC (ulcerative colitis) patients have an increased risk of developing colorectal 
      cancer compared with the normal population. The cause underlying this higher risk
      is not fully defined but includes nutritional and environmental factors
      concomitant with genetic alterations. We aimed to evaluate genetic stability in
      the colonic tissue of UC patients in clinical remission compared with the healthy
      population, and to establish a possible correlation between nutritional habits
      and these molecular assessments. UC patients (n 42) and healthy controls (n 37)
      participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and
      medically diagnosed. Participants completed five separate 7 d dietary records,
      food-frequency questionnaires and validated 24 h recalls for nutritional
      assessment. The extent of chromosome 17 loss and the calculated chromosome index 
      was determined in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
      Correlations between the molecular and nutritional assessments were performed
      using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Significant differences in the
      nutritional intake of total fat (65 (SD 15) v. 89 (SD 25) g), cholesterol (330
      (SD 168) v. 464 (SD 177) mg), dietary fibre (32 (SD 4.7) v. 9 (SD 4) g), vitamin 
      A (1009 (SD 209) v. 506 (SD 204) microg), vitamin C (308 (SD 108) v. 72 (SD 53)
      mg) and folic acid (412 (SD 89 microg) v. 187 (SD 107)) were recorded for UC
      patients compared with controls. Significant correlations were found for the
      consumption of different food groups and the chromosome index for chromosome 17. 
      The results of our study suggest that the nutritional habits adopted by UC
      patients during clinical remission may affect key cellular components of the
      colonic tissue, inducing a high degree of aneuploidy and genetic instability, and
      probably affecting the development of colon cancer.

TI  - Changes of plasma fasting carnitine ester profile in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 110-3
AB  - AIM: To determine the plasma carnitine ester profile in adult patients with
      ulcerative culitis (UC) and compared with healthy control subjects. METHOD: Using
      ESI triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, the carnitine ester profile was
      measured in 44 patients with UC and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the fasting free carnitine level 
      between the patients with UC and the healthy controls. The fasting propionyl-
      (0.331 +/- 0.019 vs 0.392 +/- 0.017 micromol/L), butyryl- (0.219 +/- 0.014 vs
      0.265 +/- 0.012), and isovalerylcarnitine (0.111 +/- 0.008 vs 0.134 +/- 0.008)
      levels were decreased in the UC patients. By contrast, the level of
      octanoyl-(0.147 +/- 0.009 vs 0.114 +/- 0.008), decanoyl- (0.180 +/- 0.012 vs
      0.137 +/- 0.008), myristoyl- (0.048 +/- 0.003 vs 0.039 +/- 0.003), palmitoyl-
      (0.128 +/- 0.006 vs 0.109 +/- 0.004), palmitoleyl- (0.042 +/- 0.003 vs 0.031 +/- 
      0.002) and oleylcarnitine (0.183 +/- 0.007 vs 0.163 +/- 0.007; P < 0.05 in all
      comparisons) were increased in the patients with UC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest
      selective involvement of the carnitine esters in UC patients, probably due to
      their altered metabolism.

TI  - Effect of fish oil enriched enteral diet on inflammatory bowel disease tissues in
      organ culture: differential effects on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 7466-72
AB  - AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal
      tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed
      non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients
      with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control
      patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with
      Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK)
      modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture
      system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium
      alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining 
      for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of
      inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control
      were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected
      tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased
      IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1;
      26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected
      tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 
      69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control
      10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase
      the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control
      (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average
      percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was
      significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8
      vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly
      higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its
      fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta
      cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly
      more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of
      IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of 
      elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary
      treatment of UC may be possible.

TI  - Thyroid disorders in Brazilian patients with celiac disease.
PG  - 33-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIM: Patients with celiac disease (CD) can develop a gluten related 
      autoimmune disorder that affects not only the small intestine but other tissues
      as well. An increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases has been reported,
      particularly autoimmune thyroiditis. The aim of this study was to characterize
      thyroid disorders in patients with CD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Fifty-two patients with 
      CD (43 female, 9 male; mean age, 41.1 years) were studied. Nine were on a
      gluten-free diet (GFD). They were divided into four groups: Group 1, without
      thyroid involvement (n=30); Groups 2A-C, with thyroid involvement (n=22); Group
      2A, subclinical hypothyroidism (n=11); Group 2B, clinical hypothyroidism (n=10); 
      and Group 2C, other thyroid disorders (n=1). CD was confirmed by serologic and
      histologic criteria. Thyroid involvement was detected by measurement of thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO).
      RESULTS: Increased levels of TSH and/or anti-TPO levels were detected in Groups
      2A (21.1%) and 2B (19.2%). The patients of Group 2B presented clinical symptoms
      of hypothyroidism before the diagnosis of CD, and 5 of these patients were
      receiving levothyroxine. One woman (Group 2C; 1.92%) had a medullary carcinoma.
      There was statistical significance between the age when thyroid disease was
      diagnosed (current age) and the age of CD diagnosis between Groups 1 and 2B.
      Patients with thyroid involvement presented associated diseases such as diabetes 
      mellitus (2), Down's syndrome (2), ulcerative colitis (1), and dermatitis
      herpetiformis (2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated an increased prevalence
      of thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, 19.2%; and subclinical hypothyroidism,
      21.2%), and other associated diseases in celiac patients, even on a GFD,
      increasing with the age of the patients. Screening for associated diseases is
      recommended for patients with CD, independent of age at diagnosis or treatment
      duration.

TI  - Laparoscopy-assisted ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: surgical outcomes after 10
      cases.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - We analyzed outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (LAIPA)
      from 10 patients (7 with ulcerative colitis and 3 with familial adenomatous
      polyposis) operated on between January 1998 and March 2004. Median operating time
      was 246 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. There were no
      conversions. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 (30%) patients: 2 cases of
      wound infection and 1 case of a foreign body retrieved during pouch endoscopy.
      There was a 30% reoperation rate due to unsuspected duodenal perforation, a
      persistent postoperative pain, and 1 case of intestinal obstruction after
      ileostomy closure. There were no deaths. Median time to resumption of diet was 24
      hours. Median hospital stay was 7 days. All ileostomies were closed 6 to 8 weeks 
      after LAIPA. LAIPA is feasible and safe and should be selectively offered to
      nonobese patients.

TI  - Bone loss in Crohn's disease: exercise as a potential countermeasure.
PG  - 1108-18
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with a number of secondary conditions
      including osteoporosis, which increases the risk of bone fracture. The cause of
      metabolic bone disease in this population is believed to be multifactorial and
      may include the disease itself and associated inflammation, high-dose
      corticosteroid use, weight loss and malabsorption, a lack of exercise and
      physical activity, and an underlying genetic predisposition to bone loss. Reduced
      bone mineral density has been reported in between 5% to 80% of CD sufferers,
      although it is generally believed that approximately 40% of patients suffer from 
      osteopenia and 15% from osteoporosis. Recent studies suggest a small but
      significantly increased risk of fracture compared with healthy controls and,
      perhaps, sufferers of other gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative
      colitis. The role of physical activity and exercise in the prevention and
      treatment of CD-related bone loss has received little attention, despite the
      benefits of specific exercises being well documented in healthy populations. This
      article reviews the prevalence of and risk factors for low bone mass in CD
      patients and examines various treatments for osteoporosis in these patients, with
      a particular focus on physical activity.

TI  - Predisposing HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes of coeliac disease and associated
      enteropathy in microscopic colitis.
PG  - 1333-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of both genetic and serological markers of
      coeliac disease in patients with microscopic colitis, and whether there was
      associated enteropathy. METHODS: HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8, serum immunoglobulin
      A-antiendomysial and immunoglobulin A-anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies
      were investigated in 59 patients with microscopic colitis. Seventy healthy
      subjects acted as the control group. Endoscopic biopsies from the distal duodenum
      were obtained in DQ2-positive or DQ8-positive patients. Patients with
      histological changes compatible with gluten-sensitive enteropathy were started on
      a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Seventeen of 70 (24.3%) healthy controls were
      DQ2-positive. Twelve of 25 (48%) patients with lymphocytic colitis (P = 0.027
      versus controls), and 11 of 34 (32.3%) with collagenous colitis (P = 0.38 versus 
      controls) were DQ2-positive. There were no differences in the frequency of
      DQ8-positivity. The coeliac serology was positive in one patient. Duodenal
      biopsies were performed in 23 DQ2-positive and/or DQ8-positive patients. None had
      villous atrophy (Marsh III lesion) (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6.1). A Marsh 
      type I lesion was found in four patients. Three of these patients were put on a
      gluten-free diet with disappearance of diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      suggest that there is an association of lymphocytic colitis with HLA-DQ2 genes,
      which might be relevant in the pathogenesis of this disease. The association of
      microscopic colitis with Marsh type III coeliac disease seems to be rare, making 
      it unnecessary to routinely screen for coeliac disease in microscopic colitis
      patients.

TI  - Allergic colitis presenting within the first hours of premature life.
PG  - 1514-5
AB  - UNLABELLED: A prematurely born infant developed rectal blood loss several hours
      after birth, after his first formula feeding. Discontinuing the feeding resolved 
      symptoms, but after resuming feeding rectal blood loss reappeared. There were no 
      signs of necrotizing enterocolitis. Suspecting cow's milk allergy, the feeding
      was changed to a casein-based protein hydrolysate, without effect. Meanwhile,
      laboratory tests indicated cow's milk allergy. Symptoms only resolved after
      introducing an amino acid-based formula supporting a definite diagnosis of cow's 
      milk-induced allergic colitis. This is the first description of a premature
      infant with symptoms of allergic colitis, appearing within hours after birth,
      suggestive of intrauterine sensitization. The exact mechanisms of sensitization
      remain obscure. CONCLUSION: Cow's milk-induced allergic colitis can occur after
      the first feed, even in a prematurely born neonate. This is most probably due to 
      intrauterine sensitization, and should be included in the differential diagnosis 
      of rectal blood loss.

TI  - Significance of salicylate intolerance in diseases of the lower gastrointestinal 
      tract.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced
      pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an
      organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or
      inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or
      life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local
      disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the
      characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of
      gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University.
      On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of
      chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID
      intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to
      clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.)
      including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory
      bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When
      presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these 
      symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility
      of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic,
      diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.

TI  - A pilot randomised controlled trial to reduce colorectal cancer risk markers
      associated with B-vitamin deficiency, insulin resistance and colonic
      inflammation.
PG  - 639-46
AB  - Colorectal cancer risk is associated with biochemical markers for B-vitamin
      deficiency, insulin resistance and colonic inflammation, suggesting that these
      three conditions are each involved in colon carcinogenesis. We expected that
      dietary supplements of folic acid, n-3 fatty acids and calcium would reduce the
      markers and thus possibly cancer risk. We therefore randomised 98 participants,
      with previous colonic polyps or intramucosal carcinomas, to a combined treatment 
      of supplementary folic acid, fish oil and calcium carbonate, or placebos for 28
      days. Blood and faecal samples were obtained prior to and at the conclusion of
      the intervention and analysed for plasma folate, homocysteine, insulin, free
      fatty acids, triglycerides and faecal calprotectin. In addition, plasma vitamin
      B12, thiamin, glucose and C-reactive protein were assessed. Our supplemental
      strategy modestly affected some of the biomarkers associated with folate
      metabolism and insulin resistance, but had no effect on those associated with
      colonic inflammation. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and
      practicality of clinical trials aimed at reducing diet-related biochemical risk
      markers for colon cancer. We suggest that long-term intervention studies with
      tumour-related end points should be undertaken when the intervention agents used 
      are found effective in short-term biochemical risk marker trials.

TI  - Metabolic and pharmacological properties of rutin, a dietary quercetin glycoside,
      for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1499-509
AB  - PURPOSE: Orally administered rutin reportedly ameliorates 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis of rats. We investigated the metabolic and
      pharmacological properties of rutin underlying the rutin-mediated amelioration of
      the rat colitis. METHODS: Apparent partition coefficients of rutin and its
      aglycone quercetin were compared. The biochemical/chemical stability of rutin was
      examined in the contents of various segments of gastrointestinal tracts of rats. 
      Inflammatory indices were determined in the colitis rats after oral
      administration of rutin or rectal administration of quercetin. In human colon
      epithelial cells, the effect of quercetin on tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha)-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) activation was examined.
      RESULTS: The sugar residue in rutin greatly lowered the apparent partition
      coefficient and was rapidly deglycosylated to liberate quercetin in the cecal
      contents, whereas it was stable in the contents of the upper intestine. Not only 
      oral administration of rutin but also rectal administration of quercetin
      remarkably ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis rats, indicating that quercetin
      liberated from rutin is therapeutically active. Furthermore, quercetin
      dose-dependently inhibited an inflammatory signal TNF-alpha-dependent NFkappaB
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that rutin acted as a quercetin
      deliverer to the large intestine and its anti-inflammatory action in TNBS-induced
      colitis rats may be through quercetin-mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced
      NFkappaB activation.

TI  - Effects of mind-body therapy on quality of life and neuroendocrine and cellular
      immune functions in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 277-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mind-body
      therapy on neuroendocrine and cellular immune measures, health-related quality of
      life and disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. 
      METHODS: Thirty UC patients in remission or with low disease activity were
      randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 15) or a usual-care waiting
      control group (n = 15). Intervention consisted of a structured 60-hour training
      program over 10 weeks which included stress management training, moderate
      exercise, Mediterranean diet, behavioral techniques and self-care strategies.
      Quality of life, perceived stress and disease activity were assessed with
      standardized questionnaires (IBDQ, SF-36, PSS, CAI). In addition, the
      distribution of circulating lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets as well as the
      beta-adrenergic modulation of TNF-alpha production in vitro were analyzed. Urine 
      catecholamines and plasma cortisol, prolactin and growth hormone were measured
      pre- and postinterventionally, and were compared with a healthy control group (n 
      = 10). RESULTS: In response to therapy, patients in the intervention group showed
      significantly greater improvement in the SF-36 scale Mental Health and the
      Psychological Health Sum score compared with changes observed in the usual-care
      waiting control group. Patients in the intervention group showed significantly
      greater improvement on the IBDQ scale Bowel Symptoms compared with the control
      group. However, no significant group differences in circulating lymphocyte
      subsets or endocrine parameters were observed in response to therapy. In
      addition, no significant effects of intervention on either the basal levels of
      TNF-alpha or the suppressive action of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol 
      on TNF-alpha production were observed. CONCLUSION: Mind-body therapy may improve 
      quality of life in patients with UC in remission, while no effects of therapy on 
      clinical or physiological parameters were found, which may at least in part be
      related to selective patient recruitment.

TI  - Glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1302-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest 
      that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a
      conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma 
      concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may
      improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption
      are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute
      exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled
      for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a
      standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with
      1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN
      with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg
      L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and
      intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio.
      RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group
      throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either
      with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05
      (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and
      nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital
      stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+
      group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention.
      CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the
      hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical
      benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.

PG  - 318-25
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

      nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the
      colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic 
      spectrum disorder (ASD). AIM: To assess ileo-colonic LNH in ASD and control
      children and to test the hypothesis that there is an association between
      ileo-colonic LNH and ASD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and
      forty-eight consecutive children with ASD (median age 6 years; range 2-16; 127
      male) with gastrointestinal symptoms were investigated by ileo-colonoscopy.
      Macroscopic and histological features were scored and compared with 30
      developmentally normal (non-inflammatory bowel disease, non-coeliac disease)
      controls (median age 7 years; range 1-11; 25 male) showing mild non-specific
      colitis in 16 cases (13 male) and normal colonic histology in 14 cases (12 male).
      Seventy-four ASD children and 23 controls also underwent upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy. The influence on ileal LNH of dietary restriction, age at colonoscopy,
      and co-existent LNH elsewhere in the intestine, was examined. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of LNH was significantly greater in ASD children compared with
      controls in the ileum (129/144 (90%) vs. 8/27 (30%), P < 0.0001) and colon
      (88/148 (59%) vs. 7/30 (23%), P = 0.0003), whether or not controls had
      co-existent colonic inflammation. The severity of ileal LNH was significantly
      greater in ASD children compared with controls, with moderate to severe ileal LNH
      present in 98 of 144 (68%) ASD children versus 4 of 27 (15%) controls (P <
      0.0001). Severe ileal LNH was associated with co-existent colonic LNH in ASD
      children (P = 0.01). The presence and severity of ileal LNH was not influenced by
      either diet or age at colonoscopy (P = 0.2). Isolated ileal LNH without evidence 
      of pathology elsewhere in the intestine was a rare event, occurring in less than 
      3% of children overall. On histopathological examination, hyperplastic lymphoid
      follicles are significantly more prevalent in the ileum of ASD children (84/138; 
      61%) compared with controls (2/23; 9%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Ileo-colonic LNH 
      is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and
      gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation.
      Differences in age at colonoscopy and diet do not account for these changes. The 
      data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD
      children.

TI  - Prevalence and outcome of allergic colitis in healthy infants with rectal
      bleeding: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis is often diagnosed clinically in healthy infants
      with rectal bleeding and often treated with costly hypoallergenic formula. The
      true prevalence of allergic colitis is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that
      allergic colitis is overdiagnosed in healthy infants with rectal bleeding. The
      authors also determined whether rectal bleeding in infants without allergic
      colitis would resolve without diet change. METHODS: For the purposes of this
      study, allergic colitis was defined histologically as colonic mucosa with >or= 6 
      eosinophils per high power field and/or eosinophils in colonic crypts or
      muscularis mucosae. We surveyed all 56 Ohio NASPGHAN members to determine
      standard practice regarding the evaluation of rectal bleeding in infants. In
      addition, infants <or= 6 months old with rectal bleeding were recruited from the 
      referral area of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All infants
      underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies at 5, 10 and 15 cm. Formula or
      maternal diet was changed only for infants with histologic findings of allergic
      colitis as defined. Study subjects were followed for 9 weeks. RESULTS: In the
      survey of NASPGHAN members, 84% indicated they would empirically change the diet 
      of an infant with rectal bleeding to treat presumed allergic colitis. In our
      study population, however, only 14 of 22 (64%; 95% confidence interval, 41-83)
      infants with rectal bleeding had allergic colitis. Five (23%) had normal biopsies
      and three (14%) had nonspecific colitis. Rectal bleeding in all infants with
      normal biopsies or nonspecific colitis resolved without diet change except for 1 
      infant subsequently diagnosed with infantile inflammatory bowel disease.
      CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of infants with rectal bleeding may not have
      allergic colitis and may undergo unnecessary, expensive formula or maternal diet 
      changes that may discourage breast-feeding.

TI  - Dietary peptides increase endogenous amino acid losses from the gut in adults.
PG  - 1359-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of endogenous ileal total nitrogen and amino acid 
      flows are necessary to ascertain true dietary amino acid digestibility
      coefficients and for the factorial estimation of dietary amino acid requirements.
      OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain endogenous amino acid losses from the
      small bowel in human subjects consuming a protein-free diet or a diet with
      enzyme-hydrolyzed casein (EHC; MW <5000) as the sole source of nitrogen. DESIGN: 
      The subjects were 8 men and women with terminal ileum ileostomies after
      ulcerative colitis who consumed the protein-free and EHC-based diets in a
      crossover design. Each subject received each test diet in single meals followed
      by 2 consecutive 9-h total collections of digesta. Digesta samples for the EHC
      treatment were centrifuged and ultrafiltered (10 000 MW cutoff), with the
      precipitate-plus-retentate fraction (>10 000 MW) providing a measurement of
      endogenous ileal amino acids. RESULTS: The mean endogenous flows for most of the 
      amino acids and nitrogen were significantly (P < 0.05) higher when determined
      with the EHC-based diet than with the protein-free diet. Mean (n = 8) endogenous 
      ileal nitrogen flows were 2061 and 4233 mug/g dry matter intake for the
      protein-free and EHC-based diets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The traditional
      protein-free method underestimates endogenous ileal amino acid loss in adults.

TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel 
      disease is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      lamina propria mononuclear cells.
PG  - 417-26
AB  - IL-6/STAT-3 signals play key roles in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is
      known that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) improves inflammatory
      disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD 
      and to clarify the mechanism. We focused the inhibitory effect of LcS on the
      production of IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated large intestinal lamina
      propria mononuclear cells (LI-LPMC) isolated from mice with chronic colitis and
      in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We also determined in vivo the effect of LcS on
      murine chronic IBD models induced with dextran sodium sulphate and SAMP1/Yit
      mice. Finally, we examined the cellular determinants of LcS for the
      down-regulation of IL-6 secretion by LI-LPMC, RAW264.7 cells and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). LcS,
      but not other strains of Lactobacillus, inhibited the production of IL-6 in
      LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC and RAW264.7 cells, down-regulating the nuclear
      translocation of NF-kappaB. The LcS-diet-improved murine chronic colitis is
      associated with the reduction of IL-6 synthesis by LI-LPMC. LcS also improved
      chronic ileitis in SAMP1/Yit mice. The release of IL-6 in vitro in LPS-stimulated
      LI-LPMC, RAW 264.7 cells and UC-PBMC was inhibited by a
      polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) derived from LcS. This
      probiotic-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel disease is
      associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6
      and IFN-gamma production in LPMC. Therefore, LcS may be a useful probiotic for
      the treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Early detection of colorectal carcinoma. Pros and cons].
PG  - 26-8
AB  - Apart from a healthy diet and adequate exercise, early detection measures are
      applied in the prevention of colorectal. The hemoccult test continues to serve as
      a screening method. It it proves to be positive, a colonoscopic study should
      always be performed. Using this approach, 20-30% of polyps in the bowel and early
      cancer stages can be detected and removed as a prophylactic measure. The
      hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) and familial
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) yare the most important risk factors for the
      development of colorectal carcinoma. However, patients with Crohn's disease or
      ulcerative colitis also have a greatly increased risk and require more intensive 
      bowel cancer prophylaxis.

TI  - Are lower gastrointestinal investigations necessary in patients with coeliac
      disease?
PG  - 617-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy may be indicated in patients with coeliac disease who
      present with iron deficiency anaemia or in coeliac disease patients who have
      persisting diarrhoea despite being on a gluten-free diet. However, there are
      limited data to support this approach. METHODS: We prospectively recruited
      patients who were found to have coeliac disease, having been referred with newly 
      diagnosed iron deficiency anaemia. We also recruited a second group of patients
      with known coeliac disease. These patients had persisting diarrhoea despite being
      on a gluten-free diet for 6 months. All patients had colonoscopy and were matched
      with controls (without coeliac disease) who had similar indications for
      colonoscopy. RESULTS: Ninety-eight consecutive new patients with coeliac disease 
      and concurrent iron deficiency anaemia had colonoscopy performed. Twelve (12.2%) 
      had pathology, three of which were carcinomas. This diagnostic yield was not
      significantly different from the findings in the control group 62/362 (17.1%)
      P=0.24. In coeliac disease patients with persisting diarrhoea (n=37), the
      diagnostic yield at colonoscopy was 1/37 (2.7%). This was significantly lower
      than our findings in the control group with chronic diarrhoea 55/390 (14%)
      P=0.05. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy should be considered in patients with coeliac
      disease (over the age of 45 years) who present with iron deficiency anaemia.
      Whilst, for coeliac disease patients with persisting diarrhoea (on a gluten-free 
      diet) in the absence of sinister symptoms, a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be the
      initial investigation in order to exclude microscopic colitis. However, further
      larger prospective studies are required to evaluate this approach.

TI  - Mucosal bacteria in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - S67-72
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease of
      unknown aetiology, although bacterial species belonging to the normal colonic
      microbiota are known to be involved in its initiation and maintenance. Several
      organisms have been linked to the disease; however, mucosa-associated bacteria
      are more likely to be involved than their luminal counterparts, due to their
      close proximity to the host epithelium. Comparative bacteriological analyses were
      done on rectal biopsies to investigate differences in mucosal bacteria in
      patients with UC and healthy controls. Complex bacterial communities were found
      in both groups, with significant reductions in bifidobacterial numbers in UC,
      which suggested that they might have a protective role in the disease.
      Accordingly, a therapy for treating UC was designed, with the aim of modifying
      the mucosal microbiota to increase bifidobacterial colonisation and reduce
      inflammation. Ranges of mucosal and faecal bifidobacteria were tested for their
      substrate preferences and their abilities to survive under a variety of
      environmental conditions. A synbiotic comprising a probiotic (Bifidobacterium
      longum) isolated from healthy rectal mucosa combined with a prebiotic
      (oligofructose-enriched inulin - Synergy 1) was developed. The treatment was used
      in a randomised controlled trial involving eighteen patients with active UC, for 
      a period of 1 month. Rectal biopsies were collected at the beginning and end of
      the study. Bacteriological analysis and transcription levels of
      epithelium-related immune markers were assessed. Results demonstrated that
      short-term synbiotic treatment resulted in increased bifidobacterial colonisation
      of the rectal mucosa and induced significant reductions in the expression of
      molecules that control inflammation in active UC.

TI  - Inulin and oligofructose: impact on intestinal diseases and disorders.
PG  - S61-5
AB  - A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the
      human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both
      physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be
      optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the
      metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data
      suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation
      of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the
      prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of
      inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis
      induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human
      ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that
      resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic 
      production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or
      bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation
      and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment
      reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch
      mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic
      inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further
      clinical studies.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted ileo-colectomy for tuberculosis.
PG  - 986-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection (LACR) for benign disease has
      gained acceptance and has a lower morbidity than open surgery. Reports in Western
      literature have outlined the use of LACR for diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and Crohn's disease. We evaluated the use of LACR in patients with ileo-cecal
      tuberculosis (IC-TB) and describe our technique and results. METHODS: Twenty-six 
      patients (20 F) between 16 and 45 years of age underwent a LACR for IC-TB over a 
      4-year period. Three access ports were used in 22 patients, four patients needed 
      four ports. The cecum, ascending colon, proximal transverse colon, and terminal
      ileum were mobilized completely. The right colic vessels were divided
      intracorporeally. The specimen was delivered using a 5- to 6-cm incision. The
      ileo-colic pedicle and bowel were divided outside and an ileocolic anastomosis
      performed. After placing the bowel within the abdomen the pneumoperitoneum was
      recreated, saline irrigation done, and hemostasis achieved. RESULTS: No patient
      needed a formal laparotomy. Peristalsis returned within 48 h in 19 patients and
      after 72 h in the remaining seven. Oral liquids were started on all patients by
      the 3rd postoperative day (POD) and a soft diet by the 5th POD. Twenty patients
      had a bowel movement by the 4th POD and the rest by the 5th POD. Eighteen
      patients were discharged by the 5th day and the remaining by the 7th day. Three
      patients developed wound sepsis. Twenty-one patients could resume normal activity
      within 2 weeks, the rest within a month. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted colon 
      resection seems to be an ideal operation for patients with ileo-cecal
      tuberculosis. It has minimal morbidity and allows a quick return to normal
      activity.

TI  - Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA): functional outcome after postoperative
      pelvic sepsis. A prospective study of 100 patients.
PG  - 529-33
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become a standard
      procedure for patients with ulcerative colitis requiring surgical intervention.
      The technique has greatly improved and, since 1990, all patients at Huddinge
      University Hospital have been operated on with the double stapled technique.
      Pelvic sepsis is one of the most serious complications postoperatively, and,
      according to previous reports, leads to impaired function of the pouch and, in
      some cases, extirpation of the pouch. AIM: The purpose of this study was to find 
      out if pelvic sepsis postoperatively after IPAA leads to impaired functional
      outcome at long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive
      patients with ulcerative colitis operated on between 1990 and 1997 with double
      stapled J-shaped pouches were followed prospectively with a standardised
      questionnaire, clinical follow-up and endoscopy of the pouch. The function of the
      pouch has been evaluated at a minimum of 2 years after surgery to compare the
      functional outcome between patients with and without pelvic sepsis
      postoperatively. RESULTS: Twelve patients developed pelvic sepsis
      postoperatively. No significant differences were found in pouch evacuation
      frequency, incontinence, deferral time, usage of protecting pads, skin
      irritation, evacuation problems, diet, usage of medication or social handicap.
      There was one failure in the control group. CONCLUSION: In this study, no
      evidence was found that suggested pelvic sepsis postoperatively impairs
      functional outcome after IPAA at long-term follow-up.

TI  - Serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 574-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more
      than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy
      individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was 
      found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no
      significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls
      (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis
      (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly
      lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum
      selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of
      patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental
      diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20).
      CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in
      patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium
      status in various disorders.

TI  - An oral supplement enriched with fish oil, soluble fiber, and antioxidants for
      corticosteroid sparing in ulcerative colitis: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 358-69
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: N-3 fatty acids from fish oil, antioxidants, and short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) produced during the fermentation of soluble fiber may
      attenuate inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). We assessed the
      efficacy of a nutritionally balanced oral supplement enriched with fish oil,
      fructooligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium on disease
      activity and medication use in adults with mild to moderate UC. METHODS: A total 
      of 121 patients with UC and a disease activity index (DAI) from 3-9 on a 12-point
      scale were block randomized for extent of disease and smoking status. In addition
      to their usual diet, patients consumed 18 oz of the oral supplement or a
      carbohydrate-based placebo formula each day for 6 months. Clinical and histologic
      responses were assessed at 3 and 6 months or at the final visit. A change in
      average prednisone use between groups was tested by using a linear mixed-effects 
      model. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics
      were not different between groups except for a higher total DAI score in the oral
      supplement group (7.3 +/- 1.3; n = 36) compared with the placebo group (6.2 +/-
      2.0; n = 50) ( P < .05). Both groups showed significant and similar degree of
      improvement at 6 months in DAI (-2.5 for oral supplement and -2.8 for placebo)
      and histologic index (-1.9 for oral supplement vs. -2.0 for placebo). Both
      intent-to-treat and completed patients given oral supplement had a significantly 
      greater rate of decrease in the dose of prednisone required to control clinical
      symptoms over 6 months as compared with the placebo group ( P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in clinical response combined with a decreased
      requirement for corticosteroids suggest that this enriched oral supplement can be
      a useful adjuvant therapy in patients with UC.

TI  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
      antibodies in coeliac disease before and after gluten-free diet.
PG  - 881-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perinuclear anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasmic autoantibodies are markers of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
      respectively. AIM: To determine the prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae and
      perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies in a large series of
      coeliac disease patients before and after gluten free diet, and to correlate
      anti-S. cerevisiae-positivity with intestinal mucosal damage. METHODS: One
      hundred and five consecutive coeliac disease patients and 141 controls (22
      ulcerative colitis, 24 Crohn's disease, 30 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 15
      postenteritis syndrome, 50 blood donors) were tested for anti-S. cerevisiae by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
      autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In coeliac disease
      anti-S. cerevisiae (immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin A) were slightly less 
      frequent (59%) than in Crohn's disease (75%, P = 0.16) and significantly more
      frequent than in ulcerative colitis (27%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (30%), 
      postenteritis syndrome (26%) and blood donors (4%) (P = 0.009, P = 0.0002, P =
      0.025, P < 0.0001). No correlation was found between anti-S. cerevisiae and
      degree of mucosal damage. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies 
      were detected only in one coeliac. After gluten free diet the disappearance of
      anti-S. cerevisiae-immunoglobulin A (93%) was more frequent than that of
      immunoglobulin G (17%, P = 0.0001); perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
      autoantibodies disappeared in the only coeliac positive at diagnosis. CONCLUSION:
      More than half of untreated coeliacs are anti-S. cerevisiae-positive irrespective
      of the severity of mucosal damage. Differently from immunoglobulin A, anti-S.
      cerevisiae-immunoglobulin G persisted in more than 80% after gluten free diet.
      The high prevalence of anti-S. cerevisiae in coeliac disease suggests that they
      may be the effect of a non-specific immune response in course of chronic small
      bowel disease.

TI  - Past and current theories of etiology of IBD: toothpaste, worms, and
      refrigerators.
PG  - S59-65
AB  - While tremendous advances have improved the understanding of inflammatory bowel
      disease, with regard to environmental risk factors as well as the biochemical
      nature of the inflammatory process, a determination of primary etiology remains
      elusive. Numerous theories have been proposed in the past century concerning the 
      cause of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with implications for specific
      therapies. On further study, most of these ideas and therapies have failed to be 
      accurate in theory or therapeutic approach. Others remain untested or are the
      focus of current investigation and controversy. This paper reviews the dominant
      theories of primary etiology. These hypotheses include infectious causes such as 
      Mycobacteria paratuberculosis and measles. Allergic and nutritionally related
      causes have been the focus of considerable research. Microparticles, which is
      part of the concept behind toothpaste as a cause, have been suggested more
      broadly to be the principal factor initiating Crohn's disease. Several of these
      concepts rely on the idea that there is an increased intestinal permeability that
      is the central defect leading to Crohn's disease. Rather than being an excessive 
      T cell driven process, Crohn's has been suggested to be an innate immune
      deficiency, leading to the use of colony stimulating factors to augment the
      intestinal barrier function and innate immunity. A variety of changes in the gut 
      flora, ranging from a basic dysbiosis to the absence of helminths, have been
      proposed as the root cause of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Amount of systemic steroid medication is a strong predictor for the use of
      complementary and alternative medicine in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease: results from a German national survey.
PG  - 287-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients rank high among users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
      To further elucidate this phenomenon, we sent questionnaires to a large sample of
      IBD patients in Germany to determine the patterns and predictors of their CAM
      use. METHODS: Pretested 73-item questionnaires were mailed to a randomly selected
      representative sample of 1000 IBD patients from the approximately 16,000 members 
      and associates of the German Crohn's and Colitis Association. Predictors of CAM
      use were evaluated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Completed
      questionnaires were returned by 684 patients (female patients, 61.4%; Crohn's
      disease patients, 58.3%; ulcerative colitis patients, 38.2%). Of the 671 adult
      respondents, 344 (51.3%) had experience with CAM, and significantly more of the
      ulcerative colitis patients (59.8%) than the Crohn's disease patients (48.3%) had
      experience with CAM. There was no difference by gender. Homeopathy (52.9%) and
      herbal medicine (43.6%) were the most commonly used types of CAM. The most
      frequent personal reasons for CAM use were the search for an "optimum treatment" 
      (78.9%) and the wish to stop taking steroids (63.8%). Using logistic regression, 
      we found that total cortisone intake (P = 0.0077), but not duration of disease,
      was a strong predictor of CAM use. Other predictors were experience with
      psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic support (P = 0.0029), relaxation techniques
      (P = 0.0284), an academic education (P = 0.0173), a diet utilizing whole grains
      (P = 0.0123), and a normal body weight (P = 0.0215). Although 80% of patients
      indicated that they were interested in using CAM in the future, only 24.7% felt
      sufficiently informed about it. CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of a large group of
      German IBD patients had used CAM. Prolonged or intensive steroid treatment, an
      academic education, active ways of coping, and a health-conscious life-style are 
      associated with CAM use. Given the potential side effects and interactions, the
      treating physician should focus on thorough information about the benefits and
      limitations of conventional and complementary treatment options, especially for
      IBD patients who have received prolonged or intensive steroid treatment.

TI  - An acute ileal amino acid digestibility assay is a valid procedure for use in
      human ileostomates.
PG  - 404-9
AB  - An acute (24-h) feeding/digesta sampling procedure was evaluated in a preliminary
      study using growing pigs. The validated acute procedure was then applied using
      human ileostomates to determine apparent and true ileal amino acid
      digestibilities of 4 dietary protein sources. The acute method involved feeding
      ileostomized pigs a single meal containing the test protein as part of a purified
      diet, with no previous dietary adaptation, followed by an 8-h collection of
      digesta. Apparent ileal N digestibility did not differ between the acute and
      conventional (14-d study) procedures. Eight adult human ileostomates each
      received a single meal of protein-free biscuits and a drink containing sodium
      caseinate, whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, or soy protein
      concentrate; this meal was followed by a 9-h total digesta collection period.
      Acid insoluble ash was used as an indigestible marker. True ileal amino acid
      digestibilities (means +/- SE) ranged from 90.5 +/- 2.74% for cysteine in soy
      protein concentrate to 105.3 +/- 5.66% for cysteine in sodium caseinate and were 
      markedly higher than their apparent counterparts. True ileal digestibilities for 
      total nitrogen were 101.9 +/- 0.70, 98.3 +/- 0.80, 99.5 +/- 0.80, and 98.5 +/-
      1.20% for sodium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, and
      soy protein concentrate, respectively. The 4 protein sources were virtually
      completely digested in humans by the end of the small intestine.

TI  - Lack of efficacy of a reduced microparticle diet in a multi-centred trial of
      patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and
      non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both
      the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings
      of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount 
      of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with
      active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo
      controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were
      randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in
      microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks. All patients received a reducing dose
      of prednisolone for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were Crohn's disease activity
      index, Van Hees index, quality of life and a series of objective measures of
      inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
      intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectin. After 16 weeks patients returned
      to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeks. RESULTS:
      Dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any 
      of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1
      year); e.g., for logistic regression of Crohn's disease activity index based
      rates of remission (P=0.1) and clinical response (P=0.8), in normal versus low
      microparticle groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our adequately powered and carefully
      controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake
      aids remission in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Environmental risk factors in paediatric inflammatory bowel diseases: a
      population based case control study.
PG  - 357-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures in early life have been implicated in the
      aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine environmental risk
      factors prior to the development of inflammatory bowel disease in a paediatric
      population based case control study. METHODS: A total of 222 incident cases of
      Crohn's disease and 60 incident cases of ulcerative colitis occurring before 17
      years of age between January 1988 and December 1997 were matched with one control
      subject by sex, age, and geographical location. We recorded 140 study variables
      in a questionnaire that covered familial history of inflammatory bowel disease,
      events during the perinatal period, infant and child diet, vaccinations and
      childhood diseases, household amenities, and the family's socioeconomic status.
      RESULTS: In a multivariate model, familial history of inflammatory bowel disease 
      (odds ratio (OR) 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3-8)), breast feeding (OR 2.1
      (1.3-3.4)), bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination (OR 3.6 (1.1-11.9)), and history 
      of eczema (OR 2.1 (1-4.5)) were significant risk factors for Crohn's disease
      whereas regular drinking of tap water was a protective factor (OR 0.56 (0.3-1)). 
      Familial history of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 12.5 (2.2-71.4)), disease
      during pregnancy (OR 8.9 (1.5-52)), and bedroom sharing (OR 7.1 (1.9-27.4)) were 
      risk factors for ulcerative colitis whereas appendicectomy was a protective
      factor (OR 0.06 (0.01-0.36)). CONCLUSIONS: While family history and
      appendicectomy are known risk factors, changes in risk based on domestic
      promiscuity, certain vaccinations, and dietary factors may provide new
      aetiological clues.

      using a novel method of data analysis.
PG  - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relapsing nature and varying geographical prevalence of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates environmental factors such as diet in its
      aetiology. METHODS: In order to determine which foods might be related to disease
      activity in UC a new method of dietary analysis was developed and applied.
      Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process.
      Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a
      sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease))
      was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the
      person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food
      sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted)
      weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence
      of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all
      81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active
      disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by <10 people or weighing
      <1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods. RESULTS: High FSS
      foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite
      (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from
      concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin
      properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state
      than the caffeine containing version. Beneficial foods (average intake per week) 
      included pork (210 g), breakfast cereals (200 g), lettuce (110 g), apples and
      pears (390 g), milk (1250 ml), melon (350 g), bananas (350 g), bacon (120 g),
      beef and beef products (500 g), tomatoes (240 g), soup (700 g), citrus fruits
      (300 g), fish (290 g), yogurt (410 g), cheese (110 g), potatoes (710 g) and
      legumes (120 g). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary analysis method described provides a
      new tool for establishing relationships between diet and disease and indicates a 
      potentially therapeutic diet for UC.

TI  - Dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter case-control
      study in Japan.
PG  - 154-63
AB  - To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a 
      Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative
      colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years
      after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case 
      who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and
      nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and
      unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the
      food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC
      risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 
      95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils
      (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI,
      1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the 
      intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC
      risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90),
      monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45
      to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57;
      95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study
      suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most
      retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the
      associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the
      importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: therapeutic implications.
PG  - 6-9
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex, involving
      environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune factors. Therefore, treatment
      should target components that either predispose to or mediate the chronic
      inflammatory response of IBD. At the moment it is assumed that all components are
      necessary to have the typical manifestations of IBD but, in reality, it is
      unclear to what extent each factor contributes to the disease process, and
      whether some are more important than others. In addition, some factors are not
      practical targets; for example, environmental factors are poorly defined, too
      numerous, and require changes that cannot be implemented by the physician or the 
      patient alone. The same is true for genetic factors that are still not amenable
      to therapeutic manipulations for technical and ethical reasons. This leaves
      microbial and immune factors as the two categories that can be selected for
      therapeutic intervention and where all current treatments are focused. The
      commensal gut flora can be qualitatively or quantitatively modified with
      antibiotics, probiotics, or diet, and a better characterization of enteric
      bacteria strains should help greatly in developing more effective therapies. Most
      current drugs are focused on inhibiting pro-inflammatory molecules produced by
      immune cells, including biological agents that block specific cytokines such as
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is anticipated that combination therapies
      targeting multiple pathogenic components will prove more effective than those
      blocking single components of IBD pathogenesis.
