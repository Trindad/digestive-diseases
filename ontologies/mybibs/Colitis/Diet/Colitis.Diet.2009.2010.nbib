TI  - Treatment of colitis with a commensal gut bacterium engineered to secrete human
      TGF-beta1 under the control of dietary xylan 1.
PG  - 1925-35
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21565 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While cytokine therapy and the use of immunosuppressive cytokines
      such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) offer great potential for the 
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), issues concerning formulation,
      stability in vivo, delivery to target tissues, and potential toxicity need to be 
      addressed. In consideration of these problems we engineered the human commensal
      bacterium Bacteroides ovatus for the controlled in situ delivery of TGF-beta(1)
      and treatment of colitis. METHODS: Sequence encoding the human tgf-beta1 gene was
      cloned downstream of the xylanase promoter in the xylan operon of B. ovatus by
      homologous recombination. Resulting recombinants (BO-TGF) were tested for
      TGF-beta production in the presence and absence of polysaccharide xylan in vitro 
      and in vivo, and used to treat experimental murine colitis. Clinical and
      pathological scores were used to assess the effectiveness of therapy. Colonic
      inflammatory markers including inflammatory cytokine expression were assessed by 
      colorimetric assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: BO-TGF
      secreted high levels of biologically active dimeric TGF-beta in vitro and in vivo
      in a xylan-controlled manner. Administration of xylan in drinking water to
      BO-TGF-treated mice resulted in a significant clinical improvement of colitis,
      accelerating healing of damaged colonic epithelium, reducing inflammatory cell
      infiltration, reducing expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and promoting
      production of mucin-rich goblet cells in colonic crypts. These beneficial effects
      are comparable and in most cases superior to that achieved by conventional
      steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This novel drug delivery system has potential for
      the targeted and controlled delivery of TGF-beta(1) and other immunotherapeutic
      agents for the long-term management of various bowel disorders.

TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

TI  - Local differences in electrogastrographic indices associated with total
      gastrectomy, total colectomy, distal gastrectomy and colonic replacement.
PG  - 235-48
AB  - The electrogastrographic indices of spectral frequency, instability factor (IF), 
      power amplitude, and power content (%) were compared between control subjects
      (C), and subjects following either total gastrectomy (TG), total colectomy (TC), 
      distal gastrectomy (DG) or colonic replacement surgery (CR). In the fasting
      state, both the spectral frequency and IF of the epigastric 3-cycle per minute
      (cpm) group of the TC subjects were significantly lower than those indices in C, 
      TG, DG, and CR subjects. In contrast, the power amplitude and power content of
      the epigastric 3-cpm group of both TG and DG subjects were significantly lower
      than those of C and TC subjects. The original epigastric waves of TG had
      remarkably high amplitudes. Furthermore, the absolute power of the epigastric
      3-cpm of the TC subjects was 10 times higher than that in either the C or TG
      subjects. These results may be partially explained by the assumption that the
      recorded epigastric electrogastrography (EGG) is mainly contributed to by the
      3-cpm myoelectric activity of the stomach and colon, while the infraumbilical EGG
      is mainly contributed to by the 3-cpm myoelectric activity of the colon.
      Topographic EGG maps visually supported these assumptions.

TI  - Salmon diet in patients with active ulcerative colitis reduced the simple
      clinical colitis activity index and increased the anti-inflammatory fatty acid
      index--a pilot study.
PG  - 68-73
LID - 10.3109/00365513.2010.542484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data concerning the anti-inflammatory effect of dietary n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are 
      inconsistent. Salmon fillet contains n-3 PUFAs and bioactive peptides that may
      improve its effects compared to fish oil alone. We assessed the efficacy of a
      salmon-rich diet in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An 8-week
      intervention pilot study was designed to assess the effects of 600 grams Atlantic
      salmon consumption weekly in 12 UC patients. Simple clinical colitis activity
      index (SCCAI), a dietary questionnaire, sigmoidoscopy, selected serum
      inflammatory markers, fecal calprotectin, and plasma and rectal biopsy fatty acid
      profiles were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: The levels of
      C20:4n-6 arachidonic acid in biopsies after dietary intervention were correlated 
      with histology and endoscopy scores. The concentrations of n-3 PUFAs, C20:5n-3
      eicosapentaenoic acid, C22:6n-3 docosahexaenoic acid, and the n-3/n-6 ratio
      increased in plasma and rectal biopsies. The anti-inflammatory fatty acid index
      (AIFAI) increased both in biopsies and plasma accompanied with a significantly
      reduced SCCAI. CONCLUSION: Based on evidence of SCCAI and AIFAI and a tendency of
      decreased levels of CRP and homocysteine, intake of Atlantic salmon may have
      beneficial effects on disease activity in patients with mild ulcerative colitis.

      use with demographic factors and disease phenotype in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease.
PG  - 283-90
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2009.11.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD). Furthermore, a significant number of IBD patients fail to comply
      with treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of
      non-adherence and the use of CAM in Hungarian patients with IBD. METHODS: A total
      of 655 consecutive IBD patients (CD: 344, age: 38.2 [SD 12.9]years; UC: 311, age:
      44.9 [15.3]years) were interviewed during the specialist visit by
      self-administered questionnaire including demographic and disease-related data as
      well as items analyzing the extent of non-adherence and CAM use. Patients taking 
      more than 80% of each prescribed medication were classified as adherent. RESULTS:
      The overall rate of self-reported non-adherence (CD: 20.9%, UC: 20.6%) and CAM
      (CD: 31.7%, UC: 30.9%) use did not differ between Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The most common causes of non-adherence were:
      forgetfulness (47.8%), too many/unnecessary pills (39.7%), being afraid of side
      effects (27.9%) and too frequent dosing. Most common forms of CAM were herbal tea
      (47.3%), homeopathy (14.6%), special diet (12.2%), and acupuncture (5.8%). In CD,
      disease duration, date of last follow-up visit, educational level and previous
      surgeries were predicting factors for non-adherence. Alternative medicine use was
      associated in both diseases with younger age, higher educational level, and
      immunosuppressant use. In addition, CAM use in UC was more common in females and 
      in patients with supportive psychiatric/psychological therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Non-adherence and CAM use is common in patients with IBD. Special attention
      should be paid to explore the identified predictive factors during follow-up
      visits to improve adherence to therapy and improving patient-doctor relationship.

AB  - The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for
      adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the
      literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development.
      The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected
      with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting
      diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which
      the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course,
      ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the
      'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease
      assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable
      unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment 
      is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time
      maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both
      treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is
      ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically
      significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if
      complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or
      complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary
      therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive
      nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in
      preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has
      no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal
      carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic
      surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated
      according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time
      elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.

PG  - A1898
AB  - A multidisciplinary working group has outlined evidence-based practice guidelines
      for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in children (IBD). 
      Both diagnosis and treatment of IBD in children differ significantly from
      practice in adults. The incidence of IBD in children is low (5.2 per 100,000 per 
      year in the age group 0-17 years), but most of the presenting symptoms are
      non-specific; therefore it is difficult for the general practitioner to recognise
      the disease in children. For a correct diagnosis, ileocolonoscopy and upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy are necessary, often combined with radiological
      imaging of the small bowel. In children and adolescents with Crohn's disease,
      nutritional therapy is the first choice of treatment for remission induction. As 
      maintenance treatment, immunomodulators (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) should
      be started from the time of initial diagnosis. In children and adolescents with
      ulcerative colitis, the first treatment is with aminosalicylates. Prednisone
      and/or immunomodulators (azathioprine, cyclosporin) are indicated if there is
      insufficient response to aminosalicylates. A final treatment option is colectomy.
      The transition from paediatric to adult health care needs special attention as
      the patient and his or her parents may be reluctant to change trusted contacts
      which they have made.

      their impact on IBD.
PG  - 411-7
LID - 10.1159/000320395 [doi]
AB  - Current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its 
      course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants, and re-operations. 
      On the contrary, smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and after disease
      onset improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. Smoking cessation
      improves Crohn's disease and worsens ulcerative colitis. Achieving smoking
      cessation in Crohn's disease is thus an important goal of therapy, whereas
      patients with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged to quit, because the
      beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the
      deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular effects of tobacco. Physical activity 
      improves quality of life without detrimental effect on disease activity, and may 
      contribute to increase muscle mass and to prevent osteoporosis. Regarding
      nutrition, a Western diet may be associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a 
      case-control study revealed an increased consumption of linoleic acid before
      diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Liquid diets may improve Crohn's disease flares 
      and decrease the need for steroids; however, there are no defined diets able to
      improve the disease course, and in Crohn's disease, supplementation with omega-3 
      fatty acids did not show a significant benefit. Obesity is becoming more
      prevalent in IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. In total,
      adhering to four simple lifestyle factors - never smoking, physical activity,
      prudent diet and body mass index <25 - may have a strong impact both on the
      prevention of major chronic diseases and on the course of IBD.

TI  - New insights into IBD epidemiology: Are there any lessons for treatment?
PG  - 406-10
LID - 10.1159/000320394 [doi]
AB  - Changing trends in the epidemiology of IBD provide an opportunity to examine
      possible etiological hypotheses. Why did IBD emerge in developed nations in the
      middle of the 20th century? Why did it emerge initially as ulcerative colitis but
      now Crohn's disease has become the predominate form of IBD in developed nations? 
      Why is IBD emerging in recent years in developing nations and why is it that
      ulcerative colitis is the predominate form in these countries? In this chapter we
      will explore what is known about environmental issues that impact on disease
      presentation and where they provide opportunities for therapy. Managing smoking
      cessation in Crohn's disease is substantiated by evidence showing that smokers
      have a worse course of disease than non-smokers or than persons who quit smoking.
      Introducing nicotine to patients with ulcerative colitis has not brought the
      positive results anticipated with the widespread observation that smoking
      cessation was associated with flaring of this disease. Assessing and managing
      stress in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has emerged as an important
      consideration for clinicians caring for patients with IBD, especially for
      patients with active disease who may develop maladaptive coping mechanisms.
      Recent data suggest that stress may antedate flares. It is unknown what may
      induce changes in the gut flora of patients with IBD compared to controls. There 
      are suggestions that antibiotic use in childhood and specific diets particularly 
      those lower in omega-3 fatty acids may impact on disease presentation and the
      common mechanism may be through alteration of gut flora. For at-risk families
      (where there are affected family members) perhaps greater vigilance with
      antibiotic use in childhood and ensuring diets are higher in omega-3 fatty acids 
      can be considered. In the future there may be approaches to modulate gut flora
      either with antibiotics targeted against identified noxious microbes or with
      selective probiotics that can rebalance the gut dysbiosis.

TI  - Colonoscopic findings in coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet.
PG  - 538-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: to date, there are few data on colonoscopic findings in patients with
      celiac disease, and most of these obtained in patients with iron deficiency
      anaemia. AIMS: we assessed colonoscopic findings in unselected patients with
      coeliac disease, since there are no studies available also considering
      morphological aspects, and there is literature suggestion of increased prevalence
      of colorectal tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: colonoscopies with multiple biopsies
      were retrospectively analyzed in 42 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet 
      above age 40; 16 had clinical or laboratory features of iron deficiency anaemia. 
      Mucosal biopsies were evaluated for the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes
      and of mucosal eosinophils, in addition to conventional histologic assessment,
      and compared with those obtained in 15 controls. RESULTS: macroscopic
      abnormalities (polyps, diverticula, inflammatory changes) were found in 26% of
      patients. Microscopic abnormalities (lymphocytic colitis, melanosis coli, rectal 
      histiocytosis) were found in 36% of patients. None of these findings was found in
      controls. Coeliac disease patients had significantly higher eosinophil score than
      controls in the right colon, whereas this was not significantly different between
      groups in the left colon. CONCLUSIONS: colonoscopic findings in coeliac disease
      on gluten-free diet may reveal significant findings, even in patients without
      iron deficiency anaemia. There is the need of further studies in larger cohorts
      of patients to establish whether colonoscopy in these patients may be clinically 
      useful.

      (IBD). Dioxin-like compounds can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and
      alter macrophage function as well as T-cell polarization. We hypothesized that
      attenuation of the AhR signaling pathway will ameliorate colitis in a murine
      model of IBD. METHODS: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis was induced in
      C57BL/6 AhR null mice (AhR(-/-) ), heterozygous mice (AhR(-/+) ), and their
      wildtype (WT) littermates. Clinical and morphopathological parameters were used
      to compare the groups. PATIENTS: AhR pathway activation was analyzed in biopsy
      specimens from 25 IBD patients and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: AhR(-/-) mice
      died before the end of the treatment. However, AhR(-/+) mice exhibited decreased 
      disease activity compared to WT mice. The AhR(-/+) mice expressed less
      proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (6.1-
      versus 15.7-fold increase) and IL17 (23.7- versus 67.9-fold increase) and
      increased antiinflammatory IL-10 (2.3-fold increase) compared with the AhR(+/+)
      mice in the colon. Colonic macrophage infiltration was attenuated in the AhR(-/+)
      group. AhR and its downstream targets were significantly upregulated in IBD
      patients versus control (CYP1A1 -19.9, and IL8- 10-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS:
      Attenuation of the AhR receptor expression resulted in a protective effect during
      DSS-induced colitis, while the absence of AhR exacerbated the disease. Abnormal
      AhR pathway activation in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients may promote
      chronic inflammation. Modulation of AhR signaling pathway via the diet, cessation
      of smoking, or administration of AhR antagonists could be viable strategies for
      the treatment of IBD.

AB  - In this article, the recent literature exploring the epidemiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is reviewed. Epidemiologic studies present data on disease
      burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in
      developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in
      those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests 
      that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host
      facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex
      database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human
      intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In
      other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics,
      which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the 
      gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of
      IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and 
      diet.

TI  - Pre-illness changes in dietary habits and diet as a risk factor for inflammatory 
      bowel disease: a case-control study.
PG  - 4297-304
AB  - AIM: To evaluate whether symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), before
      diagnosis modify dietary habits, and to investigate the pre-illness diet in
      patients with recent IBD in comparison with an age-matched healthy control group.
      METHODS: Overall, 83 new cases of IBD (41 ulcerative colitis, 42 Crohn's disease)
      and 160 healthy controls were studied. Portions per week of 34 foods and
      beverages before onset of symptoms were recorded using a validated questionnaire.
      Duration of symptoms before IBD diagnosis, presence of specific symptoms and
      their impact on subjective changes in usual dietary habits were also recorded.
      The association between diet and IBD was investigated by multiple logistic
      regression and dietary patterns were assessed by factor analysis. RESULTS:
      Changes in dietary habits, due to the presence of symptoms, were reported by
      38.6% of patients and were not significantly related to specific symptoms, rather
      to long duration of symptoms, only in Crohn's disease patients. In IBD patients
      who did not change dietary habits, moderate and high consumption of margarine (OR
      = 11.8 and OR = 21.37) was associated with ulcerative colitis, whilst high
      consumption of red meat (OR = 7.8) and high intake of cheese were associated with
      Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: More than one third of IBD patients change dietary
      habits before diagnosis. Margarine, red meat and cheese increase the risk of
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

AB  - The number of radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant diseases is increasing
      worldwide. During the radiotherapy of tumors in the minor pelvis and abdomen
      intestinal inflammation of different degree may occur even if special attention
      is paid. Irradiation to the minor pelvis causes in half of the cases radiation
      induced acute enteritis, whereas in 25% chronic enteritis and colitis will
      develop. Chronic enteritis following radiotherapy raises a number of diagnostic
      and therapeutic problems that can be solved only with cooperation of different
      specialties. Authors present a short review regarding therapeutical options of
      radiation induced enteritis.

TI  - Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is feasible in complex colorectal resections
      and could enable day case colectomy.
PG  - 835-40
LID - 10.1007/s00464-010-1275-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fast-track surgery accelerates recovery, reduces morbidity, and
      shortens hospital stay. However, the benefits of laparoscopic versus open surgery
      remain unproven within a fast-track program. Case reports of laparoendoscopic
      single-site (LESS) colectomies are appearing with claims of cosmetic advantage
      and decreased parietal trauma. This report describes the largest case series of
      LESS colorectal surgery and its effects on recovery. METHODS: In this series, 20 
      consecutive unselected patients underwent LESS colorectal surgery including right
      hemicolectomy (n = 3), extended right hemicolectomy, high anterior resection (n =
      2), low anterior resection involving total mesorectal excision (TME; n = 3),
      ileocolic anastomosis (n = 2, including 1 redo surgery), colectomy and ileorectal
      anastomosis (n = 4, including 1 with ventral mesh rectopexy), panproctocolectomy 
      (n = 2), proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch (n = 2) and an abdominoperineal
      excision of rectum. Single-port conventional instrumentation and transversus
      abdominus plane (TAP) block analgesia were used. The indications included cancer 
      (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 4), ulcerative colitis (n = 3) complicated
      diverticulosis (n = 2), and slow-transit constipation (n = 3). Eight of the
      patients had undergone previous surgery. RESULTS: Most of the cases (90%) were
      managed successfully using the LESS technique and conventional instrumentation.
      Two operations (10%) were converted to standard laparoscopy, due to insufficient 
      theater time and an unstable port. The operative time ranged from 45 to 240 min
      (median, 110 min). A normal diet was tolerated within 6 h by 7 patients and in 12
      to 16 h (overnight) by 11 patients. Complications included anastomotic bleed (n =
      1), ileus (n = 2), acute renal failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia and
      hypocalcemia (n = 1), urine retention (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). The
      median hospital stay was 46 h (range, 7-384 h). Eight patients were discharged
      within 24 h. There was one readmission (5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoendoscopic
      single-site colorectal resection using conventional instrumentation is feasible
      and safe when performed by an experienced team. The LESS approach may have
      advantages in terms of minimal pain, cosmesis, lower costs, and faster recovery. 
      A randomized trial is required to confirm whether LESS offers a true patient
      benefit over standard laparoscopic resection.

TI  - Body composition in childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 112-5
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

TI  - Nutrigenomics and inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 573-83
LID - 10.1586/eci.10.43 [doi]
AB  - The field of nutrigenomics recognizes gene-diet interactions, with regard to both
      the impact of genetic variation on nutrient requirements, and conversely nutrient
      regulation of the expression of genes. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility 
      that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the
      role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if
      genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering
      Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these
      involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and
      autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the 
      third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the 
      first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis,
      while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain
      prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups
      reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic
      approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease
      development in the future.

AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become the
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial
      polyposis coli syndromes. Pouch construction uses the distal 30-40 cm of ileum,
      and there exists a potential for postoperative nutrition consequences. These
      include vitamin B(12) deficiency, iron deficiency, bile acid malabsorption, and
      abnormalities of trace elements, fluids, and electrolytes. Patients who have
      undergone an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure often describe specific food 
      sensitivities that may require diet alteration, even more so than do patients
      with permanent ileostomy. There may be roles for postoperative probiotic
      supplementation in an attempt to decrease the rate of "pouchitis" and appropriate
      preoperative nutrition support to minimize the risk of perioperative
      complications.

TI  - A retrospective study on a cohort of patients with lymphocytic colitis.
PG  - 381-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The term "microscopic colitis" includes lymphocytic colitis (LC) and
      collagenous colitis, bearing common clinical presentation distinguishable only by
      histopathological examination of colonic biopsies. This study reports on
      demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcome of a cohort of patients
      with LC. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and histopathological data were reviewed.
      Every patient underwent total colonoscopy with multiple biopsies examined by an
      expert pathologist. Diagnosis of LC was confirmed if histopathological criteria
      were present. Routine laboratory tests were collected to rule out other
      diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 80 patients (28 males; mean age: 46.4 years). At 
      diagnosis, 71 patients (88%) reported diarrhea, 46 (58%) abdominal pain, 21 (36%)
      weight loss, 10 (13%) nausea. Regarding autoimmune or inflammatory diseases
      accompanying LC, thyroid disorders and celiac disease (CD) ranked first.
      Moreover, in over 10% of patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy,
      duodenal biopsies showed villi alterations classified as Marsh I damage, without 
      clinical and serological data for diagnosis of CD. Mesalazine and oral topical
      steroids (budesonide or beclomethasone) were used to treat LC in 34 (43%) and 32 
      (39%) of patients, respectively, with similar percentages of clinical response
      (approximately 80%). CONCLUSIONS: The need for total colonoscopy with multiple
      biopsies in all patients with chronic watery diarrhea was confirmed. Since the
      association between CD and LC exists, additional tests should be performed in
      patients not responding to gluten-free diet or to LC specific therapy to exclude 
      the other condition. Mesalazine obtained a similar outcome than oral steroids in 
      this cohort.

      frontiers with celiac disease.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.214 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The enteropathy associated with common variable immunodeficiency
      (CVID) is poorly characterized, and its possible relationships with well-defined 
      causes of enteropathy, such as celiac sprue (CS), remain debated. We aimed to
      assess the clinical and histopathological features of the enteropathy associated 
      with CVID. METHODS: The medical files of 50 CVID patients with gastrointestinal
      symptoms were analyzed retrospectively. Histological, phenotypic, and molecular
      analysis of intestinal endoscopic specimens was centrally performed. RESULTS:
      Chronic diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal symptom (92%), and
      biological evidence of malabsorption was observed in 54% of patients. Chronic
      gastritis associated or not with pernicious anemia and microscopic colitis were
      the most frequently observed histopathological features in gastric and colonic
      mucosa, respectively. Small-bowel biopsies available in 41 patients showed
      moderate increase in intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes in 31 patients
      (75.6%) and villous atrophy in 21 patients (51%). Distinctive features from CS
      were a profound depletion in plasma cells and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia.
      Presence of peripheral blood CD8+ hyperlymphocytosis was predictive of intestinal
      intraepithelial hyperlymphocytosis. Intravenous (i.v.) immunoglobulin (Ig)
      therapy had no effect on enteropathy-related symptoms. Gluten-free diet improved 
      only two out of 12 patients with villous atrophy, whereas all patients (7/7)
      responded to steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Several distinctive features
      differentiate CVID enteropathy from other causes of enteropathy including CS.
      Replacement i.v. Ig therapy is insufficient to improve gastrointestinal symptoms.
      Steroids are effective in reducing inflammation and restoring mucosal
      architecture.

AB  - Nutrition-related factors together with components of the gut-associated
      microbial ecosystem (gut microbiota) emerge as prime environmental triggers for
      the development and modification of lifestyle-related chronic diseases including 
      chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract such as Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Although a variety of susceptibility genes were
      identified in genome-wide association studies, the impact of environmental
      factors in initiating or promoting the development of these complex diseases are 
      unknown. Nutrigenomics is a transdisciplinary approach to understand the subtle
      but contentious impact of nutrition and/or microbes as prime environmental
      triggers in shaping the dynamic range between health and diseases. Profiling
      technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabonomics at the
      interface of the host's genetic make-up and its metabolic phenotype are
      implemented to identify cellular and molecular targets to develop novel
      hypothesise with respect to the functional role of diet and gut bacteria in
      modulating chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.

LID - S0004-28032010000100009 [pii]
AB  - CONTEXT: Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease involving
      superficial inflammation of the mucosa of the colon, rectum, and anus, sometimes 
      including the terminal ileum. When in clinical activity, the disease is
      characterized by various daily evacuations containing blood, mucus and/or pus
      alternating periods of remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional parameters
      (dietary, biochemical and anthropometric) among patients with ulcerative colitis 
      followed up on an outpatient basis over a period of 1 year and during periods of 
      intestinal inflammatory activity and remission. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were
      studied over a period of 1 year and divided into two groups: group 1 with
      inflammatory disease activity (n = 24), and group 2 without disease activity (n =
      41). Anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, quantitative food intake,
      and qualitative food frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in
      body mass index and weight and in the intake of energy, proteins, lipids,
      calcium, iron and phosphorus was observed in the group with inflammatory activity
      (group 1) when compared to the period of clinical remission. The most affected
      food groups were cereals, legumes, oils, and fats. In contrast, in group 2
      significant differences in triceps and sub scapular skin fold thickness, total
      protein, hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed between the first and final
      visit. Calcium and vitamin B6 intake, as well as the consumption of legumes, meat
      and eggs, and sugar and sweets, was significantly higher than on the first visit.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis
      tend to be well nourished. However, the nutritional aspects studied tend to
      worsen during the period of inflammatory disease activity.

TI  - Mechanisms of gastric emptying disturbances in chronic and acute inflammation of 
      the distal gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - G861-8
AB  - It is unclear why patients with inflammation of the distal bowel complain of
      symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract, specifically to gastric
      emptying (GE) disturbances. Thus we aimed to determine occurrence and putative
      pathomechanisms of gastric motor disorders in such patients. Thirteen healthy
      subjects (CON), 13 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 7 with diverticulitis (DIV) underwent a standardized (13)C-octanoic
      acid gastric emptying breath test. Plasma glucose, CCK, peptide YY, and
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured periodically and correlated with GE
      parameters. Results were given in means +/- SD. Compared with CON, GE half time
      (T) was prolonged by 50% in CD (115 +/- 55 vs. 182 +/- 95 min, P = 0.037). Six
      CD, 2 DIV, and 2 UC patients had pathological T (>200 min). Postprandial plasma
      glucose was increased in all patients but was highest in DIV and correlated with 
      T (r = 0.90, P = 0.006). In CD, mean postprandial CCK levels were increased
      threefold compared with CON (6.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.6 pmol/l, P = 0.027) and
      were correlated with T (r = 0.60, P = 0.041). Compared with CON, GLP-1 levels
      were increased in UC (25.1 +/- 5.2 vs. 33.5 +/- 13.0 pmol/l, P = 0.046) but
      markedly decreased in DIV (9.6 +/- 5.2 pmol/l, P < 0.0001). We concluded that a
      subset of patients with CD, UC, or DIV has delayed GE. GE disturbances are most
      pronounced in CD and might partly be caused by excessive CCK release. In DIV
      there might be a pathophysiological link between decreased GLP-1 release,
      postprandial hyperglycemia, and delayed GE. These explorative data encourage
      further studies in larger patient groups.

AB  - Recent advances in molecular techniques have now made it possible to interrogate 
      the human microbiome in depth to better understand the interactions with the host
      organism and its role in diseases. We now report the utility of Length
      Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction (LH-PCR) to survey samples and a
      proprietary Multitagged Pyrosequencing (MTPS) methodology to interrogate the gut 
      microbiome in healthy and disease states. We present an overview of our studies
      demonstrating the application of these molecular-biology techniques to an example
      disease state such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The findings show that
      there is a core mucosal bacterial microbiome (i.e., a mucosal biofilm) that is
      distinct from the luminal microbiome in health, and that the mucosal microbiome
      appears to be dysbiotic in IBD. We propose that the mucosal microbiome forms a
      synergistic and stable interaction with the host immune system, while the lumen
      microbiome varies based on diet or other environmental factors. We define this
      composite ecosystem of the human microbiome and human host as the Human
      Metabiome.

TI  - Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy).
PG  - 245-9
AB  - Celiac disease may be initially detected in either children or adults, even in
      the elderly. This small intestinal mucosal disorder is gluten-dependent and
      causes nutrient malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis
      depends on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel along 
      with an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Recurrent changes usually
      result from poor adherence to the gluten-free diet, sometimes intentional, or
      from consumption of unsuspected gluten sources. In others, the original diagnosis
      may not be correct (e.g., duodenal involvement with Crohn's disease) or another
      cause for symptoms may have supervened (e.g., collagenous colitis, functional
      bowel disease). Rarely, a complication may occur (e.g., collagenous sprue,
      lymphoma). In some, the gluten-dependent nature of the small bowel disorder was
      not initially documented and biopsy changes continued despite a gluten-free diet.
      These have a sprue-like intestinal disorder, also labeled unclassified sprue.
      This represents a small, but likely, heterogeneous group, and in these,
      intractable symptoms may be present and, in some, lymphoma is eventually
      diagnosed.

PG  - 181-92
LID - S0212-16112010000200001 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and
      important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence
      of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis 
      and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary
      treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli,
      regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal
      mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in
      Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible
      (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined
      treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel
      stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of
      either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits
      has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids)
      could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the
      activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising
      results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for
      probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role
      for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral
      component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotic yeasts: anti-inflammatory potential of various non-pathogenic strains
      in experimental colitis in mice.
PG  - 2134-45
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro immunomodulation capacity of various non-pathogenic
      yeast strains and to investigate the ability of some of these food grade yeasts
      to prevent experimental colitis in mice. METHODS: In vitro immunomodulation was
      assessed by measuring cytokines [interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-10, tumor necrosis
      factor and interferon gamma] released by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      after 24 h stimulation with 6 live yeast strains (Saccharomyces ssp.) and with
      bacterial reference strains. A murine model of acute 2-4-6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis was next used to evaluate the distinct prophylactic 
      protective capacities of three yeast strains compared with the performance of
      prednisolone treatment. RESULTS: The six yeast strains all showed similar
      non-discriminating anti-inflammatory potential when tested on immunocompetent
      cells in vitro. However, although they exhibited similar colonization patterns in
      vivo, some yeast strains showed significant anti-inflammatory activities in the
      TNBS-induced colitis model, whereas others had weaker or no preventive effect at 
      all, as evidenced by colitis markers (body-weight loss, macroscopic and
      histological scores, myeloperoxidase activities and blood inflammatory markers). 
      CONCLUSION: A careful selection of strains is required among the biodiversity of 
      yeasts for specific clinical studies, including applications in inflammatory
      bowel disease and other therapeutic uses.

PG  - S62-74
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200900543 [doi]
AB  - Increased levels of n-6 arachidonic acid (AA), a precursor of pro-inflammatory
      eicosanoids, have been found in the colon mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease
      patients when compared with healthy subjects. The hypothesis was that dietary AA 
      would aggravate colon inflammation by changing expression of genes in
      inflammatory signaling pathways. AA-enriched diet was fed to IL10 gene-deficient 
      (Il10-/-) mice, model of a inflammatory bowel disease, and compared with Il10-/- 
      mice fed an oleic acid control diet. Effects of AA on gene expression profiles
      during colitis were examined using whole genome microarray analysis. Dietary AA
      decreased the expression levels of some colonic genes in ER stress, complement
      system, nuclear respiratory factor 2-mediated oxidative stress and positive acute
      phase response pathways compared with Il10-/- mice fed an oleic acid diet. AA
      increased the expression levels of fatty acid catabolism genes, but decreased
      that of lipid synthesis genes during colitis, likely by sterol regulatory element
      binding transcription factor 1 and target gene regulation. A link has been
      suggested between AA and reduction of intestinal fibrosis by down-regulating the 
      expression levels of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic marker genes. Contrary to the 
      hypothesis, these findings suggest that dietary AA, in the present experimental
      conditions, is not pro-inflammatory, reduces ER stress and protects colonocytes
      from oxidative stress in Il10-/- mice.

TI  - [Case of suspicious lansoprazole-associated collagenous colitis in
      ANCA-associated nephritis].
PG  - 141-6
AB  - In January 2003, a 70-year-old female consulted a doctor for a fever of unknown
      origin. She had microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, BUN 41 mg/dL, Cr 2.1 mg/dL
      and MPO-ANCA 44 U/mL, and was suspected of having ANCA-associated nephritis. A
      renal biopsy was not conducted because the patient had just one kidney. She was
      treated with prednisolone (PSL ; 40 mg/day). Subsequently, because of Cr level
      improvement, the amount of PSL was decreased. In October 2006, the patient again 
      had microscopic hematuria, proteinuria and a slightly elevated Cr level. Lowering
      of BP and dehydration caused by a common cold were considered to be the cause of 
      her renal dysfunction. She was admitted to Fukuoka University Hospital for 2
      weeks, where she received diet therapy and a changed medication schedule in which
      furosemide was stopped and the dose of enalapril was decreased from 5 mg/day to
      2.5 mg/day. Because the MPO-ANCA level was < 10 EU, the amount of PSL was not
      changed. After 11 months, treatment with lansoprazole at 30 mg/day was started.
      At the end of the same month, however, she exhibited gait disturbance due to
      swelling, redness and tenderness in the bilateral pedal joints. After one month
      of receiving lansoprazole, she experienced a high fever and an elevated Cr level.
      Accordingly she was again admitted to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with 
      venous thrombosis in the lower limbs, and warfarization was begun. Her condition 
      improved, gradually, and she was discharged from the hospital. After the
      discharge, she began to exhibit watery diarrhea three to four times per day.
      Therefore, treatment with warfarin potassium was stopped 50 days after it was
      begun. In spite of the cessation of warfarization, the diarrhea continued. She
      underwent bacterial culturing and lower endoscopic examinations (no biopsy was
      done), which showed erosion of the colon, but the cause of the diarrhea was not
      found. After 181 days of treatment with lansoprazole, administration of this drug
      was stopped. The symptoms disappeared within 5 days. There have been few reports 
      of collagenous colitis with chronic diarrhea, but a good prognosis has been
      described in these cases. Clinicians should consider drug treatment as a possible
      cause of collagenous colitis in the case of patients with chronic diarrhea of
      unknown origin during the administration of medication.

TI  - Outcomes after laparoscopic surgery in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2796-802
LID - 10.1007/s00464-010-1050-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach to the
      management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children are not clearly known.
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive cohort study of children with a
      diagnosis of IBD who underwent a laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted procedure
      at a quaternary pediatric referral center between 1999 and 2007. RESULTS:
      One-hundred thirty-six children underwent 154 operations (85 small
      bowel/ileocolic and 69 colorectal) over the 8 years of the study. Median age was 
      14.8 years (range = 1.8-18.8). The diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 83,
      ulcerative colitis in 50, and indeterminate colitis in 3. Median time to regular 
      diet was 5 days (range = 1-19), and median postoperative stay was 7 days (range =
      1-70). Seven patients undergoing a small bowel/ileocolic resection (8.2%) were
      converted to an open procedure. Overall morbidity for the small bowel/ileocolic
      procedures was 27.1%. The conversion rate during subtotal colectomy (STC) was
      7.1% (3/42), and it was 0% for the 22 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis (IPAA) procedures. Overall morbidity associated with STC was 62.8%,
      and following IPAA it was 63.6%. Sixteen percent (7/69) of those who underwent a 
      colorectal procedure developed a late postoperative bowel obstruction with three 
      patients requiring operative intervention. CONCLUSION: A laparoscopic approach is
      feasible with a low conversion rate in most children with IBD. Despite superior
      cosmesis, perioperative morbidity is similar to that seen with open procedures.
      Laparoscopic colorectal IBD procedures are associated with an unexpectedly high
      incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, although the rates are comparable
      to those seen with open surgery.

TI  - Role of the gut microbiota in defining human health.
PG  - 435-54
LID - 10.1586/eri.10.14 [doi]
AB  - The human superorganism is a conglomerate of mammalian and microbial cells, with 
      the latter estimated to outnumber the former by ten to one and the microbial
      genetic repertoire (microbiome) to be approximately 100-times greater than that
      of the human host. Given the ability of the immune response to rapidly counter
      infectious agents, it is striking that such a large density of microbes can exist
      in a state of synergy within the human host. This is particularly true of the
      distal gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which houses up to 1000 distinct bacterial
      species and an estimated excess of 1 x 10(14) microorganisms. An ever-increasing 
      body of evidence implicates the GI microbiota in defining states of health and
      disease. Here, we review the literature in adult and pediatric GI microbiome
      studies, the emerging links between microbial community structure, function,
      infection and disease, and the approaches to manipulate this crucial ecosystem to
      improve host health.

PG  - 744-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02272.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Ischaemic colitis is uncommon. Aetiological factors include abdominal aortic
      surgery, drugs (especially inotropics) or rheumatoid diseases, such as Takayasu's
      or Buerger's diseases. However, there is often no triggering factor, and it may
      be part of multifactorial cardiac, respiratory, renal or metabolic failure.
      METHOD: A systematic review of the current literature on the management of
      ischaemic colitis was carried out. RESULTS: Ten retrospective trials (841
      patients) were included. No randomized controlled or prospective trial of the
      management of ischaemic colitis was found. CONCLUSION: There is very little
      evidence base for the management of this condition.

TI  - Mechanisms of intestinal inflammation and development of associated cancers:
      lessons learned from mouse models.
PG  - 40-59
LID - 10.1016/j.mrrev.2010.03.001 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately 1/5th of all human
      cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures,
      diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the
      immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove 
      injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue
      destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here we focus on
      intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the
      rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be
      widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated 
      with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal
      manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article
      highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases
      and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated
      cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models
      of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely
      grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of
      the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in 
      these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in
      the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function,
      and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses
      lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this
      environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis,
      persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of
      proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant
      transformation. With regards to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, 
      however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and
      heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.

      disease.
PG  - 1696-707
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important
      pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of 
      diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on
      the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its
      remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of
      the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset 
      IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it 
      again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD
      patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom
      n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was
      divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset
      patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41
      +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in
      the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse
      group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio
      significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of
      treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte 
      membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher
      in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition
      of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.

TI  - Male gender and renal dysfunction are predictors of adverse outcome in
      nonpostoperative ischemic colitis patients.
PG  - e96-100
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181d347b9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ischemic colitis (IC) spans a broad spectrum from self-limiting
      illness to intestinal gangrene and mortality. Prognostic factors specifically for
      nonpostoperative IC were not fully characterized. We aim to focus on
      nonpostoperative IC in patients with renal dysfunction and try to identify
      prognostic factors for adverse outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective
      analysis at a university-affiliated tertiary medical center in Taiwan. From
      January 2003 to August 2008, 25 men and 52 women (mean age: 66 y) had
      colonoscopic biopsy-proven IC without prior culprit surgery. We estimated
      glomerular filtration rate with simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
      equation. Nine patients with glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL per minute
      per 1.73 m were classified as renal dysfunction group (including 7 dialysis
      patients). Adverse outcomes were defined as need for surgery and mortality.
      Predictors for adverse outcomes were captured by univariate and multivariate
      analysis. Research ethical committee approved the study protocol. RESULTS:
      Patients with renal dysfunction more often had: diabetes mellitus (56% vs. 16%,
      P=0.02), prolonged symptoms (6.8 d vs. 3.5 d, P=0.01), lower hemoglobin (11.1
      g/dL vs. 13.4 g/dL, P=0.01), and more often right colonic involvement (56% vs.
      19%, P=0.03). Renal dysfunction patients also had longer hospitalization days
      (median 15 d vs. 4 d, P=0.045). However, there was no statistical significance in
      the rate of either surgery or mortality between these 2 groups (P>0.05).
      Univariate analysis showed that renal dysfunction, sex, emergency department
      referral, presentation with abdominal pain were significant for adverse outcome
      (P<0.1). Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex conveyed 9.5-fold risk
      (P=0.01) and renal dysfunction conveyed 8.5-fold risk (P=0.03) for adverse
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpostoperative IC patients with concurrent renal
      dysfunction had distinct clinical profiles. Multivariate analysis showed that
      male patients had 9.5-fold and renal dysfunction patients had 8.5-fold increased 
      risk for adverse outcomes. Although IC is often self-limited, our data warrants
      special attention and aggressive therapy in treating these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely unknown, although
      it is plausible that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be
      protective. Metabolites derived from n-3 PUFAs are less proinflammatory than
      those from n-6 PUFAs. Earlier, no prospective cohort studies have investigated
      this hypothesis, using dietary information collected from food diaries. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the total dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs and the
      specific n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on
      the risk of developing incident UC. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five thousand six hundred
      and thirty-nine participants, living in Norfolk UK, aged 45-74 years (median age 
      at recruitment of 59.2 years), completed 7-day food diaries. These were
      interpreted using a computer programme, which converted food items into
      nutrients, including n-3 PUFAs. The cohort was monitored for participants who
      developed UC. Each case was matched with four controls and an analysis performed 
      using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: In the cohort, 22 incident cases 
      of UC were identified after a median follow-up time of 4.2 years (range 1.8-8.3
      years). A statistically significant protective odds ratio (OR) for the trend
      across tertiles was found for DHA [OR = 0.43, 95% confidence interval
      (CI)=0.22-0.86, P = 0.02] and borderline statistically significant differences
      for trends for total total n-3 PUFAs (OR = 0.56, 95% CI=0.28-1.13, P = 0.10) and 
      EPA (OR = 0.53, 95% CI=0.27-1.03, P = 0.06) after adjusting for age, sex, total
      energy intake, smoking, and other fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Total dietary n-3
      PUFAs, EPA, and DHA, particularly DHA were associated with protection from UC in 
      a cohort aged over 45 years. If the association is causal, then increasing the
      population's intake of n-3 PUFAs from oily fish may help prevent UC.

TI  - The role of laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis: systematic review with
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 949-57
LID - 10.1007/s00384-010-0898-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Crohn's disease is established in laparoscopic surgery due to partial
      bowel dissection and low postoperative complication rate. However, laparoscopic
      surgery for ulcerative colitis remains further discussed even if the trend of
      minimally invasive technique exists. This study is to figure out how laparoscopic
      surgery works for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Sixteen controlled trials were
      identified through the search strategy mentioned below. There was only one
      prospective randomized study among the studies selected. A meta-analysis pooled
      the outcome effects of laparoscopic surgery and open surgery was performed. Fixed
      effect model or random effect model was respectively used depending on the
      heterogeneity test of trials. RESULTS: Postoperative fasting time and
      postoperative hospital stay were shorter in laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative
      colitis (-1.37 [-2.15, -0.58], -3.22 [-4.20, -2.24], respectively, P < 0.05).
      Overall complication rate was higher in open surgery, compared with laparoscopic 
      surgery (54.8% versus 39.3%, P = 0.004). However, duration of laparoscopic
      surgery for ulcerative colitis was extended compared with open surgery (weighted 
      mean difference 69.29 min, P = 0.04). As to recovery of bowel function,
      peritoneal abscess, anastomotic leakage, postoperative bowel obstruction, wound
      infection, blood loss, and mortality, laparoscopic surgery did not show any
      superiority over open surgery. Re-operation rate was almost even (5.2% versus
      7.3%). The whole conversion to open surgery was 4.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic
      surgery for ulcerative colitis was at least as safe as open surgery, even better 
      in postoperative fasting time, postoperative hospital stay, and overall
      complication rate. However, clinical value of laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative
      colitis needed further evaluation with more well-designed and long-term follow-up
      studies.

      patients with inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 250-8
LID - 10.1556/OH.2010.28805 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of complementary
      and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Furthermore, a significant number of IBD patients fail to comply with treatment. 
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-adherence the use of
      CAM in Hungarian patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 655 consecutive IBD
      patients (Crohn's disease [CD]: 344, age: 38.2 + or - 12.9 years; ulcerative
      colitis [UC]: 311, age: 44.9 + or - 15.3 years) were interviewed during the visit
      at specialists by self-administered questionnaire including demographic and
      disease-related data, as well as items analyzing the extent of non-adherence and 
      CAM use. Patients taking more then 80% of each prescribed medicine were
      classified as adherent. RESULTS: The overall rate of self reported non-adherence 
      (CD: 20.9%, UC: 20.6%) and CAM (CD: 31.7%, UC: 30.9%) use was not different
      between CD and UC. The most common causes of non-adherence were: forgetfulness
      (47.8%), too many/unnecessary pills (39.7%), being afraid of side effects (27.9%)
      and too frequent dosing. Most common forms of CAM were herbal tee (47.3%),
      homeopathy (14.6%), special diet (12.2%), and acupuncture (5.8%). In CD, disease 
      duration, date of last follow-up visit, educational level and previous surgeries 
      were predicting factors for non-adherence. Alternative medicine use was
      associated in both diseases with younger age, higher educational level and
      immunosuppressant use. In addition, CAM use in UC was more common in females and 
      in patients with supportive psychiatric/psychological therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Non-adherence and CAM use is common in patients with IBD. Special attention
      should be paid to explore the identified predictive factors during follow-up
      visits to improve adherence to therapy and improving patient-doctor relationship.

AB  - Rapid increase in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence in
      developed countries, occurrence of CD in spouses and lack of complete concordance
      in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only two environmental factors have an
      established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor 
      for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental
      factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs,
      stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them,
      adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and
      antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate
      environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. 
      Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by 
      smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may
      lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate
      prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly 
      awaited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical
      (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different
      treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD,
      in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to
      December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group.
      Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract
      form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised 
      using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using
      Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels
      given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which
      1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical
      appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical
      treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic
      review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with
      none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD,
      highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result,
      the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people
      with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from
      the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature,
      together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of
      paediatric IBD experts.

AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is now the leading cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea in the USA, accounting for 30% of patients with antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea, 70% of those with antibiotic-associated colitis, and most cases of
      pseudomembranous colitis. The organism has evolved over the last 8 years to
      become more virulent and resistant to antimicrobials (NAP1/027 strain) causing a 
      more severe form of the disease that has increased mortality and healthcare
      costs. While it is generally accepted that the problem results from the overuse
      of antibiotics, and in particular second and third generation cephalosporins,
      fluoroquinolones and macrolides, recent studies suggest that acid suppression
      with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be equally culpable. A further common, but
      less recognized, etiological factor is the prolonged use of elemental diets. Such
      diets are totally absorbed within the small intestine and therefore deprive the
      colonic microbiota of their source of nutrition, namely dietary fiber, fructose
      oligosaccharides, and resistant starch. The resultant suppression of colonic
      fermentation leads to suppression of the "good" bacteria, such as
      butyrate-producers (butyrate being essential for colonic mucosal health), and
      bifidobacteria and the creation of a "permissive" environment for C. difficile
      colonization and subsequent infection. Based on this analysis, the best chance of
      suppressing the emerging C. difficile epidemic is to adopt a 3-pronged attack
      consisting of (1) avoidance of the use of prophylactic antibiotics, (2) the
      avoidance of prophylactic PPIs, and (3) the conversion of elemental diet feeding 
      to a diet containing adequate indigestible carbohydrate after the first week of
      critical illness. In this review, we highlight the rising worldwide incidence of 
      C. difficile associated diarrhea and the role played by non-residue diets in
      destabilizing the colonic microbiota.

TI  - Gluten-free diet and steroid treatment are effective therapy for most patients
      with collagenous sprue.
PG  - 344-349.e3
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2009.12.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Collagenous sprue (CS) is characterized by the presence of a
      distinctive band of subepithelial collagen deposition in the small bowel. We
      evaluated the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients with
      CS. METHODS: Thirty patients with CS were identified at the 3 Mayo Clinic sites
      between 1993 and 2009. Clinical data from medical records were reviewed. RESULTS:
      The study cohort was 70% female (age range, 53-91 years). Most patients had
      severe diarrhea and weight loss. Hospitalization to treat dehydration was
      necessary in 16 (53%) patients. Associated immune-mediated diseases were noted in
      70% of the patients; celiac disease was the most frequent. Other associated
      diseases were microscopic colitis, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune enteropathy.
      The median thickness of the layer of subepithelial collagen deposition in the
      small bowel was 29 mum (20-56.5 mum). Subepithelial collagen deposition in the
      colon or stomach was noted in 8 patients. A clinical response was observed in 24 
      (80%) patients after treatment with a combination of a gluten-free diet and
      immunosuppressive drugs. Histologic improvement was confirmed in 9 patients, with
      complete remission in 5. Two patients died (1 of complications of CS and 1 of
      another illness). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with CS are treated effectively with
      a combination of gluten-free diet and steroids. CS is often associated with
      collagen deposition or chronic inflammation in other segments of the
      gastrointestinal tract as well as other immune-mediated disorders.

TI  - Combining nutrition, food science and engineering in developing solutions to
      Inflammatory bowel diseases--omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as an example.
PG  - 60-72
LID - 10.1039/c0fo00057d [doi]
AB  - The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, 
      and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory
      effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in
      enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission.
      However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these
      diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major
      factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the
      products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity
      of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect 
      the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal
      contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary
      supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not,
      whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest,
      processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final
      product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have
      utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest
      that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to 
      establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.

TI  - [Coeliac disease and other autoimmunological disorders coexistance].
PG  - 370-2
AB  - UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (gluten enteropathy) is a chronic inflammatory
      disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of autoimmune etiology in genetically 
      predisposed individuals. It is the most frequent enteropathy with frequency of
      1/100 and 1/300 in the adult population in America and Europe respectively.
      Typical form of celiac disease including abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea is
      quite rare in adults. In some coeliac patients, symptoms persist in spite of
      strict gluten free diet. One of the reasons of this is interference of the
      autoimmune diseases. Results of our studies revealed in the group of 110 patients
      with diagnosed gluten enteropathy, coexistence of autoimmune disease, such as
      diabetes mellitus type 1 in 7.2% cases, hyperthyreosis on 1.8% of cases, vitiligo
      in 0.9% of cases, primary biliary cirrhosis in 2% of cases and rheumatoidal
      arthritis in 0,9 of cases. In the group of 80 ulcerative colitis patients,
      coexistence of celiac disease basing on serological histopatological
      investigation was found in 4 patients (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of coeliac
      disease with other autoimmune diseases is quite frequent. Gluten enteropathy
      symptoms may be interpreted as originating from other autoimmune disease. It can 
      delay the diagnosis of celiac disease and introduction of gluten free diet, which
      improves the quality of life and protects from dangerous GI complications.

AB  - Many milk-derived components have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory

PG  - 781-8
LID - 10.1038/onc.2009.421 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease, including at least three
      major forms: hereditary, sporadic and colitis-associated CRC. A large body of
      evidence indicates that genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, chronic
      inflammation, diet and lifestyle are the risk factors for CRC. As elevated
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was found in most CRC tissue and is
      associated with worse survival among CRC patients, investigators have sought to
      evaluate the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
      selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs) on CRC. The epidemiological studies, clinical
      trials and animal experiments indicate that NSAIDs are among the most promising
      chemopreventive agents for this disease. NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory and
      antitumor effects primarily by reducing prostaglandin production by inhibition of
      COX-2 activity. In this review, we highlight breakthroughs in our understanding
      of the roles of COX-2 in CRC and inflammatory bowel disease. These recent data
      provide a rationale for re-evaluating COX-2 as both the prognostic and the
      predictive marker in a wide variety of malignancies and for renewing the interest
      in evaluating relative benefits and risk of COXIBs in appropriately selected
      patients for cancer prevention and treatment.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two forms of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Genetic and environmental factors influencing the onset and course
      of this disease have recently been identified. Among the environmental and
      dietary factors involved in the development of inflammatory colon diseases,
      dietary polyphenols have been proposed as protective agents in distinct models of
      colon inflammation. However, despite the huge number of studies on the beneficial
      effects of polyphenols on health, their dietary effectiveness is unclear. In this
      review, we examine some of the evidence linking dietary polyphenol intake with
      protection against IBD.

TI  - Regulation of inflammatory responses by gut microbiota and chemoattractant
      receptor GPR43.
PG  - 1282-6
LID - 10.1038/nature08530 [doi]
AB  - The immune system responds to pathogens by a variety of pattern recognition
      molecules such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which promote recognition of
      dangerous foreign pathogens. However, recent evidence indicates that normal
      intestinal microbiota might also positively influence immune responses, and
      protect against the development of inflammatory diseases. One of these elements
      may be short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are produced by fermentation of
      dietary fibre by intestinal microbiota. A feature of human ulcerative colitis and
      other colitic diseases is a change in 'healthy' microbiota such as
      Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes, and a concurrent reduction in SCFAs. Moreover,
      increased intake of fermentable dietary fibre, or SCFAs, seems to be clinically
      beneficial in the treatment of colitis. SCFAs bind the G-protein-coupled receptor
      43 (GPR43, also known as FFAR2), and here we show that SCFA-GPR43 interactions
      profoundly affect inflammatory responses. Stimulation of GPR43 by SCFAs was
      necessary for the normal resolution of certain inflammatory responses, because
      GPR43-deficient (Gpr43(-/-)) mice showed exacerbated or unresolving inflammation 
      in models of colitis, arthritis and asthma. This seemed to relate to increased
      production of inflammatory mediators by Gpr43(-/-) immune cells, and increased
      immune cell recruitment. Germ-free mice, which are devoid of bacteria and express
      little or no SCFAs, showed a similar dysregulation of certain inflammatory
      responses. GPR43 binding of SCFAs potentially provides a molecular link between
      diet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism, and immune and inflammatory
      responses.

TI  - Collagenous sprue is not always associated with dismal outcomes: a
      clinicopathological study of 19 patients.
PG  - 12-26
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2009.151 [doi]
AB  - Collagenous sprue is associated with high morbidity; however, the etiology of
      this disorder is unclear. Data regarding the pathological and clinical
      manifestations of patients with collagenous sprue are also limited. We, thus,
      undertook this study to gain insight into the etiology, disease manifestations
      and outcomes of collagenous sprue. We searched our departmental database
      (1999-2008) to identify cases of collagenous sprue and to obtain clinical and
      laboratory data. Small bowel histology, including thickness of subepithelial
      collagen, intra-epithelial lymphocyte phenotype and results of T-cell clonality
      assays were evaluated. Nineteen patients (15 women, 4 men, age 22-80 years, mean 
      57 years) were identified. Seventeen (89%) had celiac disease and two had
      unclassified sprue; 9 of 17 (53%) celiac disease patients had refractory disease;
      5 of 15 (33%) lacked diarrhea (atypical presentation), including 2 of 6 (33%)
      with active (untreated) celiac disease and 3 of 9 (33%) with refractory celiac
      disease. Autoimmune disorders were seen in 12 of 19 (63%) patients and
      microscopic colitis (n=7), lymphocytic gastritis (n=2) or collagenous gastritis
      (n=2) were seen in nine patients. Subepithelial collagen thickness was mildly
      (n=6), moderately (n=10), or markedly (n=3) increased and villous atrophy was
      total (n=13) or subtotal (n=6). Phenotypically aberrant intraepithelial
      lymphocytes were not detected in any case. Polymerase chain reaction analysis
      showed a dominant T-cell clone in the only patient with refractory celiac disease
      type II. Histological improvement occurred in 7 of 11 (64%) patients. Overall, 8 
      of 19 (42%) responded to gluten-free diet, including 2 of 9 (22%) with refractory
      celiac disease and 10 responded to immunomodulatory therapy, including 6 of 9
      (67%) with refractory celiac disease. Only one patient died from complications of
      refractory celiac disease. No patient developed lymphoma. The vast majority of
      our patients with collagenous sprue had celiac disease. Although, many patients
      required immunomodulatory therapy for symptom control, a subset responded to
      gluten-free diet alone. In our experience, collagenous sprue patients had
      relatively good clinical outcomes.

AB  - Inflammatory diseases of the intestine, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis, and celiac disease are now very common in Australia and remain major
      challenges for clinicians. Australian (and New Zealand) clinicians and scientists
      have made considerable contributions to our current understanding of these
      diseases over the last 50 years, including pathogenesis (such as the 'butyrate
      hypothesis', 'endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress', and the identification of the
      peptide sequences that incite celiac disease), true population epidemiology
      (albeit in New Zealand), precise clinical observation, new investigative tools,
      innovative new potential therapies, influential clinical drug trials (such as
      triple antibiotics for Crohn's disease), and a dietary approach with efficacy for
      functional gut symptoms (the low FODMAP diet). Underpinning the success has been 
      clinical excellence and adaptation of clinicians to the changing landscape of
      disease severity and therapeutic options. The future is indeed bright if such
      trends continue.

AB  - In the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a number of extraintestinal
      manifestations are known to occur, being the dermatological ones often associated
      to both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum and erythema
      nodosum are the most frequent, but there are other skin manifestations less
      frequently reported such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. We present a case, in
      which Crohn's disease and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were simultaneously
      diagnosed, and corticoids treatment achieved complete remission of the both
      cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations.

TI  - Environmental factors affecting inflammatory bowel disease: have we made
      progress?
PG  - 215-25
LID - 10.1159/000228553 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially
      understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic, epithelial, immune, and
      nonimmune) factors are involved. The critical role for environmental factors is
      strongly supported by recent worldwide trends in IBD epidemiology. One important 
      environmental factor is smoking. A meta-analysis partially confirms previous
      findings that smoking was found to be protective against ulcerative colitis and, 
      after the onset of the disease, might improve its course, decreasing the need for
      colectomy. In contrast, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease 
      and aggravates its course. The history of IBD is dotted by cyclic reports on the 
      isolation of specific infectious agents responsible for Crohn's disease or
      ulcerative colitis. The more recently published cold chain hypothesis is
      providing an even broader platform by linking dietary factors and microbial
      agents. An additional, recent theory has suggested a breakdown in the balance
      between putative species of 'protective' versus 'harmful' intestinal bacteria -
      this concept has been termed dysbiosis resulting in decreased bacterial
      diversity. Other factors such as oral contraceptive use, appendectomy, dietary
      factors (e.g. refined sugar, fat, and fast food), perinatal events, and childhood
      infections have also been associated with both diseases, but their role is more
      controversial. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that economic development, leading 
      to improved hygiene and other changes in lifestyle ('westernized lifestyle') may 
      play a role in the increase in IBD. This review article focuses on the role of
      environmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of IBDs.

TI  - Do probiotics have a role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 155-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease treatments have generally revolved around
      immunological manipulations to reduce inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Bacterial interactions with the gastrointestinal epithelium may be a trigger for 
      inflammatory changes which occur in the gut. Antibiotics have been shown to alter
      disease activity in Crohn's disease. Probiotics (live microorganisms)
      administered for therapeutic purposes have been proposed due to the possibility
      of their altering the interaction of the gut mucosa with enteric bacteria.
      Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials
      indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific
      inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis. Trials in Crohn's disease have shown mixed results.

TI  - Dietary fiber, low-molecular-weight food constituents and colo-rectal
      inflammation in animal models -- a review.
PG  - 1281-8
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200800576 [doi]
AB  - This review provides an overview over studies in experimental animals aimed at
      elucidating the influence of dietary constituents on colo-rectal inflammation.
      Human studies as well as in vitro investigations will not be covered. In
      experimental animals, a variety of chemical treatments and genetic modifications,
      lead to various types of gut inflammation. In a number of these models, there is 
      good evidence for an anti-inflammatory action of dietary tocopherols, certain
      polyphenols, and curcumin at relatively high oral doses. It has also been
      established, that oral application of fats and oils rich in n-3 PUFAs and/or
      conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) can attenuate certain types of colitis in
      experimental animal models. While the effect of dietary calcium on experimental
      colitis is less clear, there are hints indicating that certain high-fiber diets
      or diets rich in digestion-resistant carbohydrates ("fiber") can attenuate
      experimental colitis in animals, although contradictory results have been
      reported. In summary, the anti-inflammatory potency of dietary constituents on
      colon inflammation in experimental animals seems to be rather limited. The
      reasons for this lack of activity seem to be manifold including pharmacokinetic
      limitations and intestinal degradation of the compounds, in particular
      insufficient local, i. e., intra- or sub-mucosal levels of the effective
      compounds, and general limitations of animal models.

AB  - The inhibitory effects of novel prodrugs, inclusion complexes of
      3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid (GOFA) and auraptene
      (AUR) with beta-cyclodextrin (CD), on colon carcinogenesis were investigated
      using an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model. Male CD-1 (ICR)
      mice initiated with a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM (10 mg/kg body
      weight) were promoted by the addition of 1.5% (w/v) DSS to their drinking water
      for 7 days. They were then given a basal diet containing 2 dose levels (100 and
      500 ppm) of GOFA/beta-CD or AUR/beta-CD for 15 weeks. At Week 18, the development
      of colonic adenocarcinoma was significantly inhibited by feeding with
      GOFA/beta-CD at dose levels of 100 ppm (63% reduction in multiplicity, p < 0.05) 
      and 500 ppm (83% reduction in the multiplicity, p < 0.001), when compared with
      the AOM/DSS group (multiplicity: 3.36 +/- 3.34). In addition, feeding with 100
      and 500 ppm (p < 0.01) of AUR/beta-CD suppressed the development of colonic
      adenocarcinomas. The dietary administration with GOFA/beta-CD and AUR/beta-CD
      inhibited colonic inflammation and also modulated proliferation, apoptosis and
      the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as nuclear
      factor-kappaB, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Stat3, NF-E2-related factor 2,
      interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta, which were induced in the adenocarcinomas. Our
      findings indicate that GOFA/beta-CD and AUR/beta-CD, especially GOFA/beta-CD, are
      therefore able to inhibit colitis-related colon carcinogenesis by modulating
      inflammation, proliferation and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in
      mice.

TI  - Zinc and micronutrient combinations to combat gastrointestinal inflammation.
PG  - 653-60
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283308dd6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with
      zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient
      deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of
      gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological
      observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both
      nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal
      response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The
      interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional
      status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed.
      These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient
      deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet;
      micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major
      types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and 
      HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be
      exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY:
      For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve
      immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of
      single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of
      uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.

AB  - Incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have shown a
      dramatic increase in last decades. Diagnosis can be made at any age, no sex
      predominance is apparent, and while mortality rates are similar to in general
      population, higher rates of colorec-tal cancer are evident in most studies,
      probably as a consequence of long-term chronic inflammation. Probably, IBD are
      polygenic diseases sharing genes of sus-ceptibility for both of them (Ulcerative 
      colitis and Crohn disease), but with other specific different genes for each one.
      Among environmental risk factors described, smoking is the most important, with
      different behaviour in both diseases, though there have been described other
      associated risk factors like appendectomy, oral contraceptives, infections, diet,
      childhood hygiene, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory intake.

PG  - 885-91
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the
      intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been
      postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information
      of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through 
      the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from
      genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and
      adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, 
      ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive
      immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with 
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD,
      including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly
      aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies
      such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory
      molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been
      supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and
      therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary 
      factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary 
      diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging
      concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields,
      nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the
      genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according 
      to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that
      develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in
      the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current
      intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a
      personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and 
      may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.

PG  - 1440-9
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181ae2545 [doi]
AB  - Collagenous sprue is a rare form of small bowel enteropathy characterized by
      chronic diarrhea and progressive malabsorption with little data available on its 
      natural history. The pathologic lesion consists of subepithelial collagen
      deposition associated with variable alterations in villous architecture. The
      small bowel biopsies of 12 cases were reviewed. Clinical details, celiac
      serology, and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement study results, when available,
      were collated. There were 8 females and 4 males (age ranged from 41 to 84 y) who 
      presented with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Small intestinal biopsies showed
      subepithelial collagen deposition with varying degrees of villous atrophy and
      varying numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Four patients had previous
      biopsies showing enteropathic changes without collagen deposition. Seven cases
      were associated with collagenous colitis and 1 also had features of lymphocytic
      colitis. Three patients also had collagen deposition in gastric biopsies. One
      case was associated with lymphocytic gastritis. Celiac disease (CD,
      gluten-sensitive enteropathy) was documented in 4 patients. Five patients made a 
      clinical improvement with combinations of a gluten-free diet and
      immunosuppressive therapy. Two patients died of complications of malnutrition and
      1 of another illness. Clonal T-cell populations were identified in 5 of 6 cases
      tested. Four of these patients improved clinically after treatment but 1 has
      died. Collagenous sprue evolved on a background of CD in 4 cases. There was no
      history of CD in others and these cases may be the result of a biologic insult
      other than gluten sensitivity. None has developed clinical evidence of lymphoma
      to date.

TI  - The benefits of a laparoscopic approach in ileal pouch anal anastomosis
      formation: a single institutional retrospective case-matched experience.
PG  - 197-200
LID - 10.1007/s11845-009-0399-0 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: A laparoscopic approach to ileoanal pouch formation is novel. By using
      prospectively gathered data, laparoscopic and open restorative proctocolectomy
      procedures in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis 
      (FAP) patients were compared using a case-matched design. METHODS: Ten
      consecutive patients have had laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA)
      since April 2005. Their intraoperative findings, immediate and early
      postoperative outcomes are compared with ten non-selected patients who had an
      open IPAA pre April 2005. RESULTS: Laparoscopic IPAA group had a shorter time to 
      ileostomy function, a reduced mean time to regular diet and a mean shorter
      hospital stay. Their overall opioid analgesia requirements were 50% that of the
      open group. There were no re-operations or readmissions in either group. Mean
      operative time was longer for the laparoscopic group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      undergoing laparoscopic IPAA can expect faster postoperative gastrointestinal
      recovery, reduced blood loss, reduced opioid requirements and improved cosmesis.

TI  - Linoleic acid, a dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and the aetiology of
      ulcerative colitis: a nested case-control study within a European prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1606-11
LID - 10.1136/gut.2008.169078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is
      metabolised to arachidonic acid, a component of colonocyte membranes. Metabolites
      of arachidonic acid have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the
      mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to 
      conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake
      of linoleic acid increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis.
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were
      available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden,
      Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the
      European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These
      participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Each case 
      was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of 
      intake of linoleic acid adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake
      and centre. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed ulcerative colitis
      (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years). The
      highest quartile of intake of linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk
      of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per 
      quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The
      data support a role for dietary linoleic acid in the aetiology of ulcerative
      colitis. An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes 
      higher than the lowest quartile of linoleic acid intake.

TI  - Reduction of colonic inflammation in HLA-B27 transgenic rats by feeding Marie
      Menard apples, rich in polyphenols.
PG  - 1620-8
LID - 10.1017/S0007114509990936 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are immunomediated ailments affecting millions 
      of individuals. Although diet is regarded as an important factor influencing IBD,
      there are no accepted dietary recommendations presently available. We
      administered 7.6 % lyophilised apples obtained from two cultivars (Golden
      Delicious and Marie Menard, low and high in polyphenols, respectively) to HLA-B27
      transgenic rats which develop spontaneous IBD. After 3 months feeding, rats fed
      Marie Menard apples had reduced myeloperoxidase activity (3.6 (sem 0.3) v. 2.2
      (sem 0.2) U/g tissue; P < 0.05) and reduced cyclo-oxygenase-2 (P < 0.05) and
      inducible NO synthase gene expression (P < 0.01) in the colon mucosa and
      significantly less diarrhoea (P < 0.05), compared with control rats. Cell
      proliferation in the colon mucosa was reduced significantly by feeding Golden
      Delicious apples, with a borderline effect of Marie Menard apples. Gene
      expression profiling of the colon mucosa, analysed using the Whole Rat Genome 4 x
      44 K Agilent Arrays, revealed a down-regulation of the pathways of PG synthesis, 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and TNFalpha-NF-kappaB in
      Marie Menard-fed rats. In the stools of the animals of this group we also
      measured a significant reduction of bacteria of the Bacteriodes fragilis group.
      In conclusion, the administration of Marie Menard apples, rich in polyphenols and
      used at present only in the manufacturing of cider, ameliorates colon
      inflammation in transgenic rats developing spontaneous intestinal inflammation,
      suggesting the possible use of these and other apple varieties to control
      inflammation in IBD patients.

TI  - [24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion in patients with
      ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 452-4
AB  - UNLABELLED: The experimental data show that in mucosal injury of the alimentary
      system serotonin metabolism and secretion is disturbed. Such suggestions are also
      drawn in discussions concerning pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. THE AIM OF
      THE STUDY: To perform a quantitative evaluation of 24-hour urine excretion of a
      major serotonin metabolite-5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied group comprised 50
      patients with exacerbated UC, aged 21-56 years. Among them 25 had mild and 25
      severe exacerbation according to Trulove's and Witts criteria. The control group 
      comprised 25 healthy persons. On the study day the patients remained on standard 
      liquid diet--Nutrdrink 3 x 400 ml with the caloric value of 1800 kcal. 5-HIAA
      concentration was measured by ELISA method applying IBL antibodies (RE 59131),
      and the results were presented in mg/dl and then the value of 24-hour urine
      excretion was calculated. Results. In the group o patients with severely
      exacerbated UC 5-HIAA excretion was significantly lower that in healthy
      volunteers--1.66 +/- 0.98 mg/24 hi 5.77 +/- 0.46 mg/24 respectively (p < 0.05).
      The results of 5-HIAA excretion showed positive correlation with serum albumin
      concentration. In the group of patients with mild colitis such significant
      changes and correlations were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: (1) In severe
      exacerbations of UC serotonin metabolism is largely changed. (2) 24-hour
      serotonin excretion can have a predictive value in UC.

TI  - Potential for amino acids supplementation during inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21017 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and
      involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially 
      immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to
      treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation.
      The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone
      or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However,
      standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be
      improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids.
      Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for
      enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are
      until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance
      glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved
      in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the
      effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other 
      candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated
      in the future.

TI  - Fish consumption and markers of colorectal cancer risk: a multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 354-61
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is a major factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer, with
      high fish consumption possibly decreasing colorectal cancer risk, as was shown in
      several observational studies. To date, no intervention trials have examined the 
      possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich
      or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. DESIGN: In a
      multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal 
      polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were
      recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 
      300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n
      = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured 
      in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213).
      RESULTS: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the
      salmon or cod group: -0.10 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.20),
      respectively, compared with the DA group. The total number of mitotic cells per
      crypt decreased nonsignificantly in the salmon group (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.41, 0.68)
      and in the cod group (-1.04; 95% CI: -2.62, 0.53) compared with the DA group.
      Furthermore, the distribution of mitosis within the crypt did not significantly
      change in either group. CONCLUSION: An increase in the consumption of either
      oil-rich or lean fish to 2 portions weekly over 6 mo does not markedly change
      apoptotic and mitotic rates in the colonic mucosa. This trial was registered at
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00145015.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal autoimmune condition with
      an inappropriate immune response. We investigated DNA damage induced in vitro in 
      lymphocytes from IBD patients caused by oxidative stress through H(2)O(2) and
      2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and whether the plant flavonoids,
      quercetin and epicatechin, found in fruits, tea and soybeans could effectively
      reduce such stress. Lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy volunteers were
      treated with 50 microg/ml H(2)O(2) or IQ in the presence of quercetin (0-250
      microg/ml) or epicatechin (0-100 microg/ml). Flavonoid supplementation (250
      microM quercetin or 100 microM epicatechin) caused an overall significant
      decrease of induced DNA damage resulting in a 48.6% (P < 0.001) reduction of
      H(2)O(2)-induced and a 43% (P < 0.001) reduction of IQ-induced DNA damage within 
      the patient groups; for the control groups, reductions in DNA damage were 35.2
      and 57.1%, respectively (both, P < 0.001). There was less induced DNA damage
      within lymphocytes from UC patients compared to CD patients for both series of
      experiments (H(2)O(2) and quercetin, IQ and epicatechin). In conclusion,
      flavonoids dramatically reduced oxidative stress in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD
      patients and healthy individuals. Thus, flavonoids could be very effective in the
      treatment of oxidative stress and encouraged in the diet of IBD patients.

TI  - The therapeutic impact of manipulating microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2074-86
AB  - It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal
      microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration
      of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome 
      of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher 
      risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore,
      probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use
      due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This
      review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role 
      of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD,
      and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.

TI  - Nutritional status and nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 2570-8
AB  - Underweight and specific nutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, a significant number of
      children with IBD, especially Crohn's disease (CD) have impaired linear growth.
      Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD. In adults with CD,
      enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD,
      although it is less efficient than corticosteroids. Exclusive EN is an
      established primary therapy for pediatric CD. Limited data suggests that EN is as
      efficient as corticosteroids for induction of remission. Additional advantages of
      nutritional therapy are control of inflammation, mucosal healing, positive
      benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects.
      The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for
      maintenance of remission in CD. More studies are needed to confirm these
      findings. However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as
      an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD. EN does not have a primary
      therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. Specific compositions of enteral
      diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to
      have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment
      of CD or UC need further evaluation. Recent theories suggest that diet may be
      implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches
      to reduce the risk of developing IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing between the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's 
      disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) is important for both management and
      prognostic reasons. Discrimination using noninvasive techniques could be an
      adjunct to conventional diagnostics. Differences have been shown between the
      intestinal microbiota of CD and UC patients and controls; the gut bacteria
      influence specific urinary metabolites that are quantifiable using proton
      high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study tested 
      the hypothesis that such metabolites differ between IBD and control cohorts, and 
      that using multivariate pattern-recognition analysis, the cohorts could be
      distinguished by urine NMR spectroscopy. METHODS: NMR spectra were acquired from 
      urine samples of 206 Caucasian subjects (86 CD patients, 60 UC patients, and 60
      healthy controls). Longitudinal samples were collected from 75 individuals. NMR
      resonances specific for metabolites influenced by the gut microbes were studied, 
      including hippurate, formate, and 4-cresol sulfate. Multivariate analysis of all 
      urinary metabolites involved principal components analysis (PCA) and partial
      least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: Hippurate levels were
      lowest in CD patients and differed significantly between the three cohorts
      (P<0.0001). Formate levels were higher and 4-cresol sulfate levels lower in CD
      patients than in UC patients or controls (P=0.0005 and P=0.0002, respectively).
      PCA revealed clustering of the groups; PLS-DA modeling was able to distinguish
      the cohorts. These results were independent of medication and diet and were
      reproducible in the longitudinal cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Specific urinary
      metabolites related to gut microbial metabolism differ between CD patients, UC
      patients, and controls. The emerging technique of urinary metabolic profiling
      with multivariate analysis was able to distinguish these cohorts.

AB  - Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably
      multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological
      factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar,
      fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were
      examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers
      infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD.
      Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing
      incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the
      aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary
      approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of
      nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and
      correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and
      vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key 
      points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy
      and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial
      nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. 
      The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.

TI  - Colon in food allergy.
PG  - S89-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a15d1a [doi]
AB  - The colon is a site of allergic reaction to food proteins. The most common
      manifestation is allergic proctocolitis. Although frequent in infancy, it may
      also affect older children. The diagnosis of allergic proctocolitis is mainly
      based on clinical and histological grounds, but there is a risk of overdiagnosis;
      challenge is strongly recommended to avoid unnecessary and expensive formula or
      changes in maternal diet that may discourage continuation of breast-feeding. The 
      benign clinical course and the spontaneous resolution in most infants suggest the
      need for further prospective studies to validate markers that allow the
      identification of those children needing a dietary approach. It remains to be
      assessed whether lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the colon is a manifestation of

AB  - Susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases depends upon interactions between
      the genetics of the individual and induction of chronic mucosal inflammation. We 
      hypothesized that administration of dietary phenolics, caffeic acid and rutin,
      would suppress upregulation of inflammatory markers and intestinal damage in a
      mouse model of colitis. Colitis was induced in C3H/ HeOuJ mice (8 weeks old, 6
      male/6 female per treatment) with 1.25% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 6 d in
      their drinking water. Rutin (1.0 mmol (524 mg)/kg in diet), caffeic acid (1.0
      mmol (179 mg)/kg in diet), and hypoxoside extract (15 mg/d, an anticolitic
      phenolic control) were fed to the mice for 7 d before and during DSS treatment,
      as well as without DSS treatment. Body weight loss was prevented by rutin and
      caffeic acid during DSS treatment. Colon lengths in mice fed caffeic acid and
      hypoxoside during DSS treatment were similar to DSS-negative control. Food intake
      was improved and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was decreased with each phenolic treatment
      in DSS-treated mice compared with DSS treatment alone. Colonic mRNA expression of
      IL-17 and iNOS were inhibited when IL-4 was increased by each phenolic treatment 
      combined with DSS, whereas CYP4B1 mRNA was increased only by caffeic acid in
      DSS-treated mice, compared with DSS treatment alone. Colonic and cecal
      histopathology scores of DSS-treated mice were significantly more severe (P <
      0.01) than in mice fed caffeic acid before and during DSS treatment, based on
      mucosal height, necrosis, edema, erosion, and inflammatory cell infiltration.
      Although both rutin and caffeic acid suppressed the expression of selected
      inflammatory markers, only caffeic acid protected against DSS-induced colitis, in
      association with normalization of CYP4B1 expression. The inhibition of
      DSS-induced colitic pathology by caffeic acid was mediated by mechanisms in
      addition to anti-inflammatory effects that deserve further study.

TI  - Allergic proctocolitis, food-induced enterocolitis: immune mechanisms, diagnosis 
      and treatment.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - The term food allergy refers to the immune reaction (mediated by IgE or
      otherwise) that develops in response to the ingestion of a concrete type of food.
      Among the different potential manifestations of an allergic reaction, those
      exclusively affecting the gastrointestinal system are described. In recent years,
      the study of non-IgE-mediated food allergy has grown in relevance. These
      disorders are almost always of a transient nature, inherent to (though not
      exclusive of) nursing infants, and with gastrointestinal symptoms that may have
      variable repercussions upon the nutritional state of the patient. The prevalence 
      of such reactions is not known, though some studies report that up to 60 % of all
      cases of allergy to cow's milk proteins (CMPs) are due to non-IgE-mediated
      mechanisms. The latency period between the time of ingestion and the appearance
      of the first clinical manifestations is greater than in the case of IgE-mediated 
      reactions, and the underlying immunopathological mechanism has not been clearly
      established although it is accepted that T cell mediation is involved. The
      gastrointestinal problems derived from these delayed or chronic reactions
      comprise allergic proctocolitis, enterocolitis and food protein enteropathies.
      These digestive disorders tend to appear in the first months of life, and are of 
      a progressive and generally self-limiting nature, with resolution at about two
      years of age. The most commonly implicated food is milk and, in our setting,
      there have also been reports implicating fish, egg and rice although such
      reactions can be triggered by any protein introduced into the infant diet. These 
      manifestations disappear after removing the causal protein from the diet. When
      the causal proteins are CMPs, a highly hydrolysed infant formula is supplied as
      substitute, and if the latter is not tolerated, an elemental amino acid-based
      formula is prescribed.

PG  - 1-6

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long been considered a disease that affects 
      predominantly a Western population. The incidence and prevalence rates from Asian
      populations are much lower in comparison. More recent data, however, have shown
      significantly higher rates in Asians and time trend studies have shown an
      increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and a similar but lower rise
      in Crohn's disease (CD). The epidemiological changes that are taking place mirror
      that of the Western experience seen 50 years previously and seem to occur in
      parallel with the rapid socioeconomic development taking place in Asia. It
      appears that certain racial groups are more prone than others to develop IBD. For
      instance, Indians in South-East Asia have higher rates compared to Chinese and
      Malays. While there is host genetic predisposition, environmental factor(s) may
      be responsible for this difference. Migrant studies of South Asians in the UK,
      where second-generation immigrants have assumed incidence rates as high as the
      indigenous whites and Asian Jews who develop high incidence rates comparable to
      Jews from Europe or North America in Israel point to the role of environmental
      factors. It is unclear which specific factors are responsible. Studies have
      suggested a change in diet to a more Westernized one may underlie this
      epidemiological change in the Asian population. It is likely that there are
      racial groups amongst Asians who are more susceptible to IBD and who will
      demonstrate a higher frequency of IBD when exposed to putative environmental
      factors.

TI  - Surgical treatment of complex enterocutaneous fistulas in IBD patients using
      human acellular dermal matrix.
PG  - 1208-12
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients represent a high-risk group
      for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) formation, related to both their disease
      process and the need for multiple surgeries. Often the abdominal wall is
      significantly involved with the ECF and requires partial resection. The use of
      synthetic prosthetic material to reconstruct the abdominal wall after ECF surgery
      is associated with increased risk of infection and recurrent fistulas. Herein we 
      report the use human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) in the surgical treatment and
      reconstruction of the abdominal wall in 11 consecutive IBD patients with complex 
      and medically refractory ECF. METHODS: After resection of the involved bowel
      segment and the overlying abdominal wall, a single sheet of hADM was used to
      reconstruct the defect. Pre- and perioperative risk factors were reviewed and
      patients were followed prospectively for a year (360 +/- 118 days). RESULTS:
      Operative mortality was nil. Three patients (27%) developed subcutaneous seroma
      and there were 2 cases (18%) of superficial wound infection, all of which
      resolved with conservative management. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.5 
      (+/-7.2) days and all patients were tolerating an oral diet at the time of
      dismissal. There were no recurrences. One patient with Crohn's disease developed 
      a new ECF from a separate bowel site on postoperative day 145, which was treated 
      with the same surgical approach. No further complications have occurred.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in a high-risk IBD patient population with
      multiple perioperative risk factors the use of hADM during ECF takedown is an
      effective and well-tolerated treatment option.

TI  - Total laparoscopic repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with short proximal necks.
PG  - 43-8
LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2008.09.005 [doi]
AB  - With the development of endovascular aneurysm repair, abdominal aortic aneurysms 
      with short infrarenal necks (< or =10 mm, AAASN) are considered juxtarenal
      aneurysms. Minimally invasive treatment consists of hybrid procedures or
      fenestrated endografts. We present our experience with direct aortic repair for
      AAASN performed via a total laparoscopic approach. Data are expressed as median
      values with extremes. From February 2002 to December 2007, 32 patients had total 
      laparoscopic AAASN repair. Length of the infrarenal aortic neck was 5 mm (0-10). 
      Median age of the 29 men and three women was 70 years (range 50-84). Nine
      patients presented with preoperative grade 1 renal insufficiency (28.1%). The
      procedure was totally laparoscopic in 30 patients (93.7%). Aortic approaches
      included left retrorenal (n = 24) and transperitoneal left retrocolic (n = 8)
      exposures. Median operative and clamping times were 270 (range 215-410) and 83
      (range 36-147) min, respectively. Aortic clamping was suprarenal in 14 cases
      (43.7%), with suprarenal clamping time of 24 min (range 9-37). Median blood loss 
      was 850 mL (range 215-2,400). Thirty-day mortality was 3.1% (one patient died
      from myocardial infarction). Two patients presented with severe systemic
      complications (6.4%, postoperative coagulopathy with hemorrhagic syndrome,
      pneumopathy). Seventeen patients developed mild or moderate systemic nonlethal
      complications (53.1%): transient renal insufficiencies (n = 12), grade 1 ischemic
      colitis (n = 1), surrenal insufficiency (n = 1), myocardial ischemia (n = 1), and
      cardiac arythmia (n = 2). One patient was reoperated for an intestinal
      obstruction. Liquid diet was reintroduced after 1 day (range 1-13). Most patients
      were ambulatory by day 3 (range 2-17). Median lengths of stay were 48 hr (range
      12-552) in the intensive care unit and 10 days (range 4-37) in the hospital. With
      a median follow-up of 27 months (range 1-50), 28 patients are alive, with
      complete recovery without graft anomalies. Three patients died, from pneumopathy 
      (n = 1) and carcinoma (n = 2), respectively, at 29, 19, and 44 months' follow-up.
      Two patients presented stable juxta-renal aortic dilation <35 mm. Total
      laparoscopic juxtarenal AAA repair is feasible and worthwhile for patients with
      AAASN. Short- and midterm results match well with those of open surgery. Total
      laparoscopic repair in AAASN reduces the trauma of extensive surgical approaches.
      Based on these encouraging early results, we elected to perform laparoscopy
      whenever possible in good surgical risk patients with AASN.

      inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA)
      composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw
      Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition
      were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters 
      were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the 
      number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic
      acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were
      inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP
      in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was
      correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated 
      in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and
      systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the
      active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the
      systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the
      systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal 
      disease activity.

      comparative observational study on long-term functional results.
PG  - 526-32
LID - 10.1007/s11605-008-0755-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Long-term results after laparoscopic ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA)
      have not been thoroughly evaluated. Our study prospectively compares short- and
      long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and open IPAA. METHODS: Between October 2002
      and November 2007, 73 laparoscopic and 106 open IPAA patients were enrolled.
      Patient- and disease-specific characteristics and short- and long-term outcomes
      were prospectively collected. RESULTS: There were no differences in demographics,
      treatment, indication, duration of surgery, and diversion between groups.
      Laparoscopic patients had faster return of flatus (p = 0.008), faster assumption 
      of a liquid diet (p < 0.001), and less blood loss (p = 0.026). While
      complications were similar, the incidence of incisional hernias was lower in the 
      laparoscopic group (p = 0.011). Mean follow-up was 24.8 months. Average number of
      bowel movements was 6.8 +/- 2.8/day for laparoscopy and 6.3 +/- 1.7 for open (p =
      0.058). Overall, 68.4% of patients were fully continent at 1 year, up to 83.7%
      long term without differences between groups. Other indicators of defecatory
      function and quality of life remain similar overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic
      IPAA confers excellent functional results. Most patients are fully continent and 
      have an average of six bowel movements/day. When present, minor incontinence
      improves over time. Laparoscopy mirrors the results of open IPAA and is a
      valuable alternative to open surgery.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Increased folate intake with no changes in serum homocysteine and decreased
      levels of C-reactive protein in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 627-33
LID - 10.1007/s10620-008-0398-4 [doi]
AB  - In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status 
      regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis)
      received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients 
      for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the
      study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of
      anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and
      blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid,
      homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency
      was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the 
      patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake
      (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid,
      homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant
      decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained
      at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of
      patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and
      homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to
      choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the
      inflammatory process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of emergency
      laparoscopic surgical management of complicated diverticular disease. METHOD: A
      prospectively collected electronic database of all colorectal laparoscopic
      procedures between April 2001 and September 2007 has been used to identify
      outcomes in patients presenting with complicated diverticular disease. RESULTS:
      Sixty-six patients (28 men), median age 69 years (23-95), ASA grade II (12), III 
      (38), IV (16) have undergone emergency surgery for complicated
      diverticulitis--Hinchey grades I (27), II (29), III (7) and diverticular bleeding
      (3) over a 6(1/2)-year period: 43 high anterior resections, 17 Hartmann's
      resections and seven low anterior resections. Diverticular fistulas were seen in 
      16 patients: colovaginal (7), colovesical (2), colo-fallopian (4), entero-colic
      (3). The median operation time was 110 min (45-195 min). There was one conversion
      to open surgery. Postoperative analgesia was provided by intravenous Paracetamol 
      in 33 patients (50%), patient-controlled analgesia in 24 (36%), oral Paracetamol 
      and Oramorph (12%) and epidural opioid infusion (1.5%). The median time to normal
      diet was 24 h (4 h-6 days) and median hospital stay 5 days (2-30). There were two
      deaths (3.3%); anastomotic leak, ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest.
      Other complications included: wound infection eight (12%), anastomotic leak four 
      (8%), port-site hernia one and one case of Clostridium difficile colitis
      requiring colectomy. There were five (7.5%) returns to theatre and two
      readmissions (3%). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic resectional surgery in complicated
      diverticular disease is a feasible, safe and a largely predictable operation that
      allows for early hospital discharge and, in our opinion, improved patient care.
      We are encouraged to continue to offer our patients the option of an emergency
      laparoscopic resection.

PG  - 149-55
LID - 10.1007/s00431-008-0721-2 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.

TI  - Free radical activity and lipid soluble anti-oxidant vitamin status in patients
      with long-term ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the operation of choice for
      patients with ulcerative colitis. Free radical activity and the status of lipid
      soluble antioxidant vitamins have not been previously assessed in patients with
      IPAA. The aim of the present study was to measure the plasma concentrations of
      lipophyllic antioxidants and free radical activity in IPAA patients and compare
      them with normal subjects. METHOD: Forty-eight IPAA patients and 50 healthy
      controls were studied. A dietary assessment of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and
      carotene was undertaken and plasma antioxidant status was assessed. Plasma
      malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured to assess the extent of free radical damage.
      In IPAA patients, association between the degree of inflammation in the pouch
      mucosa and the plasma concentration of lipophyllic antioxidants and extent of
      free radical activity was investigated. RESULTS: The dietary intake of carotene
      was similar in both groups. Intake of vitamin E was significantly lower in
      patients than controls (P = 0.01). In the IPAA group plasma concentrations of
      alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene were significantly lower (P < 0.001)
      and alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio significantly higher (P < 0.001). Free
      radical damage was significantly greater in patients than controls (P < 0.01).
      There were no significant correlations between the degree of inflammation in the 
      pouch and plasma concentrations of MDA, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol
      ratio or intake of vitamins. CONCLUSION: Compared with normal subjects, patients 
      with IPAA have significantly lower plasma concentrations of lipophyllic
      antioxidants alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene and higher free radical
      activity suggesting increased oxidative stress. These differences do not appear
      to be related to diet and do not correlate with histological severity of pouch
      inflammation.
