TI  - Nutrition in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it useful for prevention
      and therapy?
PG  - 983-90
AB  - Countless studies aiming to discover the cause and cure of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) have been conducted over the years world-wide. Food nutrients were 
      believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction
      with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal
      microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with
      controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has
      to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication
      can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent
      long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in
      preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of
      enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease,
      according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of
      administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on
      parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.

AB  - Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or
      fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days. More than three
      millions cases of acute diarrhea, presumably due to intestinal infections, are
      seen in general practice every year in France. Most of the cases are benign and
      resolve under symptomatic treatment within 3 days, without need for biological
      tests or antibiotics. In special contexts (septicemic syndrome, visible blood in 
      stools, severe dehydration, patients at risk of severe sepsis [valvulopathy]),
      biologic tests and probabilist antibiotic treatment are required. Hygiene,
      rehydration and diet recommendations are always part of the treatment of acute
      diarrhea, in addition to the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea and other
      digestive symptoms. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is clinically benign in most
      cases, and attributed to transient dysbiosis of gut microbiota. In the remaining 
      cases, diarrhea is the clinical expression of intestinal infection by Clostridium
      difficile, that should be treated with metronidazole, or the clinical expression 
      of a Klebsiella oxytoca-associated colitis that usually spontaneously resolves
      after stopping antibiotics.

TI  - Epigenetics and the developmental origins of inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 909-15
AB  - The gut microbiota, the intestinal mucosa and the host immune system are among
      the large biological networks involved in the development of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), which includes Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Host genetics and environmental factors can significantly modulate the
      interactive relationships among these biological systems and influence
      predilection toward IBD. High monozygotic twin discordance rates and the rapid
      rise in the prevalence of IBD indicate that environmental influences may be as
      important or even more important in their pathogenesis than genetic
      susceptibility. However, the nature and timing of environmental factors critical 
      for inducing IBD remain largely unknown. The molecular mechanisms and the key
      biological component(s) that may be affected by such factors are also in
      question. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (the methylation of
      cytosines followed by a guanine in CpG dinucleotides) can be modified by
      environmental influences during finite developmental periods and have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Mucosal DNA methylation can also react to 
      changes in the commensal microbiota, underscoring the intercalating relationships
      among the large biological systems involved in gastrointestinal disorders.
      Therefore, transient environmental influences during specific periods of
      development may induce critical change(s) in an isolated or concomitant fashion
      within the intestinal biomic networks and lead to increased susceptibility to
      IBD. The present review focuses on the emerging paradigm shift considering IBD to
      originate from critical environmental effects during pre- and postnatal
      development.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, inflammatory disease of the colon
      and rectum that may be associated with growth failure, nutritional derangements
      and psychosocial ramifications in affected children. Multiple medical options are
      available to achieve disease remission; however, some of these medications can
      have unwanted side effects, especially in younger patients. With increased
      understanding of the etiology of the disease, newer therapeutic alternatives have
      arisen in the form of biologic therapies, namely monoclonal antibodies targeted
      to a specific protein or receptor. Specifically, infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha
      agent, has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe pediatric ulcerative colitis.

AB  - The cytokine IL-1 is critical to the pathogenesis of a variety of human
      conditions and diseases. Unlike most other cytokines, IL-1 is counterbalanced by 
      two endogenous inhibitors. The functional significance of IL-1 receptor
      antagonist (IL-1RA) is well documented due to the clinical utilization of the
      recombinant human IL-1RA analog, anakinra. In contrast, much less is known about 
      the type 2 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R2), which acts as a decoy receptor for IL-1. While
      IL-1R2 is structurally similar to the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) responsible
      for IL-1 signal transduction, its truncated cytoplasmic domain and lack of
      Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) region renders IL-1R2 incapable of transmembrane
      signaling. IL-1R2 competes with IL-1R1 for ligands and for the IL-1R1
      co-receptor, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP). Additionally, IL-1R2
      exists in both a membrane bound and soluble form (sIL-1R2) that has biological
      properties similar to both a decoy receptor and a binding protein. Thus far,
      IL-1R2 has been implicated in arthritis, endometriosis, organ transplantation,
      sepsis/sickness behavior, diabetes, atherosclerosis, autoimmune inner ear disease
      (AIED), Alzheimer's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this review, we will
      detail the functional properties of IL-1R2 and examine its role in human disease.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0049547 [doi]
AB  - Pro-inflammatory cytokines like macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF),
      IL-1beta and TNF-alpha predominate in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and TNBS 
      colitis. Increased levels of serine proteases activating protease-activated
      receptor 2 (PAR-2) are found in the lumen and colonic tissue of IBD patients.
      PAR-2 activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines impair epithelial barrier,
      facilitating the uptake of luminal aggressors that perpetuate inflammation and
      visceral pain. Soy extracts contain phytoestrogens (isoflavones) and serine
      protease inhibitors namely Bowman-Birk Inhibitors (BBI). Since estrogens exhibit 
      anti-inflammatory and epithelial barrier enhancing properties, and that a BBI
      concentrate improves ulcerative colitis, we aimed to evaluate if a fermented soy 
      germ extract (FSG) with standardized isoflavone profile and stable BBI content
      exert cumulative or synergistic protection based on protease inhibition and
      estrogen receptor (ER)-ligand activity in colitic rats. Female rats received
      orally for 15 d either vehicle or FSG with or without an ER antagonist ICI
      182.780 before TNBS intracolonic instillation. Macroscopic and microscopic
      damages, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine levels, intestinal paracellular
      permeability, visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and PAR-2
      expression were assessed 24 h, 3 d and 5 d post-TNBS. FSG treatment improved the 
      severity of colitis, by decreasing the TNBS-induced rise in gut permeability,
      visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and PAR-2 expression at all
      post-TNBS points. All FSG effects were reversed by the ICI 182.780 except the
      decrease in faecal proteolytic activity and PAR-2 expression. In conclusion, the 
      anti-inflammatory properties of FSG treatment result from two distinct but
      synergic pathways i.e an ER-ligand and a PAR-2 mediated pathway, providing
      rationale for potential use as adjuvant therapy in IBD.

AB  - Primary duodenal localization of Crohn's disease (CD) is rare. Medical therapy
      can control symptoms, but surgery is required when progressive obstructive
      symptoms occur. Surgical options include bypass, resection, or strictureplasty,
      but it is still not clear which should be the treatment of choice. Reviewing the 
      medical records of 1253 patients undergoing surgery for CD between January 1986
      and December 2011 at the Digestive Surgery Unit of the Department of Clinical
      Physiopathology of the University of Florence, 10 patients (6 males and 4
      females) underwent operations for duodenal CD. Four patients had only a duodenal 
      localization, 6 patients had synchronous involvement of other intestinal tracts. 
      Strictures were distributed in all the duodenal portions: in 7 patients there
      were single lesions, in 3 patients there were multiple lesions. Eight patients
      were treated with strictureplasty: 5 with the Heineke-Mikulicz technique, 2 with 
      Jaboulay, and 1 with a pedunculated jejunal patch. Two patients were treated with
      resection: one with a B2 gastro-duodenal resection, and 1 with a duodenal-jejunal
      resection and an end to side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis. Follow up of the
      patients was from 2 to 18 years. No recurrence of duodenal CD was observed in the
      2 patients treated with resection, while 2 of the 8 patients treated with
      strictureplasty had a recurrence. In our experience, strictureplasty is indicated
      when less than 2 strictures are present in the 2nd or 3rd duodenal portion. In
      cases with multiple strictures localized in the 1st or the distal duodenal
      portion, resection is preferable.

TI  - [Frequency of anemia in ulcerative colitis in children].
PG  - 138-42
AB  - UNLABELLED: Anemia is one of most frequent complication of ulcerative colitis. It
      affects patients in the exacerbation of the disease as well as in the remission. 
      It may be caused by the loss of the blood, the disturbances of intestinal
      absorption or deficient diet. The aim of the study was to estimate the rate of
      anemia in children with ulcerative colitis during first hospitalization. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: The study comprised 36 children aged 2.5 to 18 years, 23 girls and
      13 boys in whom ulcerative colitis was diagnosed based on the Porto criteria.
      Anemia in children was assessed depending on the age, period between first
      symptoms and diagnosis of the disease and on the activity of the disease
      according to PUCAI scale. RESULTS: Anemia was diagnosed in 72.2% of the children.
      Hemoglobin concentration ranged from 6.3 to 12.4 g/dl, average 10.05 g/dl
      depending on age. Activity of the disease according to PUCAI scale amounted to 5 
      to 80 points, average 51.9 points. Time from first symptoms to the diagnosis of
      the disease extended from one week to 12 months, average 3.6 months. In children 
      without anemia the average concentration of hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dl, the
      activity of the disease 33.5 points and average time before diagnosis - 1.7
      months. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is a frequent symptom of ulcerative colitis in
      children. The presence of anemia depends on the disease activity and on the time 
      between first symptoms and diagnosis of the disease. There is a necessity of iron
      supplementation in children with anemia despite effective anti-inflammatory
      treatment.

PG  - 5862-9
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i41.5862 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years,
      including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of
      the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, 
      and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number
      of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life,
      including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of
      paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in
      children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include 
      isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal
      manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly
      compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of
      possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure
      prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns
      of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ
      substantially from adult-onset disease. Various treatment options are available
      for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a
      central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and
      surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and
      developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children 
      should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control 
      of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst
      preventing disease or treatment-related complications.

LID - 10.4161/gmic.22822 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic autoinflammatory responses triggered by dysregulated microbial
      interactions may lead to intestinal disorders and malignancies. Previously, we
      demonstrated that a lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus
      strain, NCK2025, ameliorated inflammation-induced colitis, significantly reduced 
      the number of polyps in a colonic polyposis cancer model and restored
      physiological homeostasis in both cases. Nonetheless, the regulatory signals
      delivered by NCK2025 to reprogram the gastrointestinal microenvironment, and thus
      resist colonic cancer progression, remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggest 
      that epigenetic changes, in the presence and absence of pathogenic inflammation, 
      can result in colorectal cancer (CRC). To test possible epigenetic modifications 
      induced by NCK2025, the expression of epigenetically regulated, CRC-associated
      genes was measured with and without bacterial treatment. In vivo and in vitro,
      NCK2025 enhanced the expression of tumor suppressor genes that may regulate CRC
      development. Therefore, differential epigenetic regulation of CRC-related genes
      by NCK2025 represents a potential therapy against colitis-associated and sporadic
      CRC.

AB  - Microbial metabolism of proteins and amino acids by human gut bacteria generates 
      a variety of compounds including phenol, indole, and sulfur compounds and
      branched chain fatty acids, many of which have been shown to elicit a toxic
      effect on the lumen. Bacterial fermentation of amino acids and proteins occurs
      mainly in the distal colon, a site that is often fraught with symptoms from
      disorders including ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In
      contrast to carbohydrate metabolism by the gut microbiota, proteolysis is less
      extensively researched. Many metabolites are low molecular weight, volatile
      compounds. This review will summarize the use of analytical methods to detect and
      identify compounds in order to elucidate the relationship between specific
      dietary proteinaceous substrates, their corresponding metabolites, and
      implications for gastrointestinal health.

PG  - 564
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-5-564 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is uncommon in the tropics and sub-tropics.
      We report a case of UC in a 7 year old girl whose parents were both Nigerians.
      This report is to alert healthcare professionals in sub-Saharan Africa that UC is
      not a rare health problem, especially in children. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient
      presented with frequent passage of blood stained stool, abdominal pain and
      significant weight loss. The diagnosis was entertained after she was investigated
      for common causes of chronic diarrhea in our setting and the findings were
      negative. The patient symptoms abated after she was commenced on steroid therapy.
      CONCLUSION: Under-diagnosis and misdiagnosis may account for a dearth of
      information on UC in African children.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The elderly represent a growing demographic of patients with
      IBD. No study has previously described variations in care or medication
      prescriptions in senior patients with IBD. We compared prescription rates among
      elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data.
      METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and 
      Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was
      assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an
      IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were
      identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific
      rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In
      patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for
      oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), 
      while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters).
      Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters 
      analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage 
      was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in
      the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal
      therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US
      and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication
      prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether 
      these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care
      costs.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutrition on gut microflora function in children with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1454-9
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.703234 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment in
      children with active Crohn's disease (CD) but is seldom used in adults with
      active disease. The mode of action of EEN in suppressing mucosal inflammation is 
      not fully understood, but modulation of intestinal microflora activity is one
      possible explanation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      6-week EEN in children with active CD, with special reference to intestinal
      microflora function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 18 children (11
      boys, 7 girls; median age 13.5 years) with active CD (13 children with small
      bowel/colonic and 5 with perianal disease) were analyzed for short chain fatty
      acid (SCFA) pattern as marker of gut microflora function. The children were
      studied before and after EEN treatment. Results from 12 healthy teenagers were
      used for comparison. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) of the children with small
      bowel/colonic CD responded clinically positively to EEN treatment showing
      decreased levels of pro-inflammatory acetic acid as well as increased
      concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyric acids and also of valeric acids,
      similar to the levels in healthy age-matched children. In children with active
      perianal CD, however, EEN had no positive effect on clinical status or
      inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present new data supporting the
      hypothesis that the well-documented anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children
      with active small bowel/colonic CD is brought about by modulation of gut
      microflora activity, resulting in an anti-inflammatory SCFA pattern. By contrast,
      none of the children with perianal disease showed clinical or biochemical
      improvement after EEN treatment.

TI  - Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity
      and disease.
PG  - 1095-119
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside
      in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the
      human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must
      maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive
      to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory
      processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence
      suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence
      susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
      Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased
      incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early
      childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an
      alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant
      immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced
      dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will
      be discussed.

TI  - Does preoperative total parenteral nutrition in patients with ulcerative colitis 
      produce better outcomes?
PG  - 1479-83
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1535-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Malnutrition is a frequent problem in patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) leading to increased postoperative complication rates. Preoperative total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been shown to reduce complications in some
      subgroups of patients, but has not been studied in UC. We investigated the impact
      of preoperative TPN on postoperative complication rates in patients undergoing
      surgery for UC. METHODS: This paper is a review of 235 patients who underwent
      surgery for UC; 56 received preoperative TPN and 179 did not. Postoperative
      complication rates were compared. RESULTS: Both had similar rates of anastomotic 
      leak (5.4 vs. 2.8 %, p = 0.356), infection (12.5 vs. 20.1 %, p = 0.199),
      ileus/bowel obstruction (21.4 vs. 15.6 %, p = 0.315), cardiac complications (3.6 
      vs. 0 %, p = 0.056), wound dehiscence (3.6 vs. 1.7 %, p = 0.595), reoperation
      (10.7 vs. 3.9 %, p = 0.086), and death (1.8 vs. 0 %, p = 0.238). The TPN group
      was more malnourished (albumin 2.49 vs. 3.45, p < 0.001), more often on steroids 
      (83.9 vs. 57.5 %, p < 0.001), had more emergent surgery (10.7 vs. 3.4 %, p =
      0.029), more severe colitis (89.3 vs. 65.9 %, p = 0.001), and lower Surgical
      Apgar Score (6.15 vs. 6.57, p = 0.033). After controlling for these with logistic
      regression, the TPN group still had higher complication rates (OR 2.32, p =
      0.04). When line infections were excluded, TPN did not significantly affect
      outcomes (OR 1.5, p = 0.311) CONCLUSION: There were no differences in
      postoperative complications when line infections were excluded. Our data does not
      support routine preoperative TPN in patients with UC. However, it may lead to
      equal surgical outcomes in the sickest and most malnourished patients at the cost
      of line-related morbidity.

AB  - The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component
      of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for
      free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been
      reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse
      models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation
      was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence
      that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial
      integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro
      model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects
      TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to
      death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that
      TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of
      gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have
      identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include
      the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through
      activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation
      of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired
      following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level
      was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible
      molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements
      ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in
      experimental colitis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the
      gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the
      heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host 
      genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota.
      Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also 
      clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, 
      attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on
      epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging
      high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow
      taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of
      patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields,
      "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics,"
      studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and
      "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health
      status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It
      is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the
      understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in 
      the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and
      treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on
      intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the
      potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients on
      conventional medical treatment compared to those after restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 325-33
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1561-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is not well studied in
      proctocolectomy patients with pediatric onset of ulcerative colitis (UC). We
      aimed to (1) compare the HRQL of proctocolectomy patients with those treated with
      conventional therapy and (2) determine factors that influence HRQL in UC patients
      < 18 years. METHODS: Chart review was done on patients diagnosed with pediatric
      onset of UC (<18) at the Stollery Children's Hospital. HRQL was evaluated in 88
      patients using disease- and age-specific questionnaires; IMPACT III (<18) and
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ; >/=18). Demographics, disease
      characteristics, disease index (PUCAI), HRQL EuroQoL visual analog scale
      (EQ-5D/VAS) were collected and analyzed from all patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five
      respondents completed the IMPACT III (74 %) and 23 patients completed the IBDQ
      (26 %). Thirty-three surgical patients (34 %) responded (mean IMPACT III score = 
      148.9 +/- 12.7; mean IBDQ = 171.2 +/- 40.1). There was no significant difference 
      in IMPACT III scores of surgical patients vs. medically treated patients (148.9
      +/- 12.7 vs. 140.6 +/- 19.4, p = 0.09). Patients with high IMPACT scores (>143
      points) were most likely to be in remission (p = 0.05), they were less likely to 
      be on medication (p < 0.05), have parent/guardian with postsecondary education (p
      = 0.01), did not suffer from fatigue (p < 0.01), and did not report depression (p
      < 0.02). The IMPACT correlation with PUCAI (adjusted r (2) = 0.33) and EQ-VAS
      (adjusted r (2) = 0.45) was strong. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients reported to
      have a HRQL comparable to or better than the nonsurgical patients. Depression,
      fatigue, parent/guardian education, and drugs influence HRQL.

TI  - Impact of environmental and dietary factors on the course of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 3814-22
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i29.3814 [doi]
AB  - Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted
      to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the
      outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of
      smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its
      influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD,
      active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this
      clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients
      who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit
      in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of
      IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very
      frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general
      dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients
      should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role 
      of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation
      of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem 
      to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil,
      medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a
      therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in
      inactive UC.

TI  - Recurrent blood eosinophilia in ulcerative colitis is associated with severe
      disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
PG  - 222-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2329-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A subset of IBD patients develops blood
      eosinophilia, and the clinical profile of these patients is undefined. We sought 
      to characterize IBD patients with and without eosinophilia. METHODS: We studied a
      prospective registry of 1,176 IBD patients followed in a tertiary referral
      center. Patients who developed eosinophilia at any time were identified by
      electronic medical record query. We performed a chart review case-control study
      comparing patients with recurrent eosinophilia versus randomly selected
      disease-matched patients with no history of eosinophilia. Histological analysis
      was performed on selected cases and controls. RESULTS: Eosinophilia at any time
      was more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than Crohn's disease
      patients (22.2 versus 12.7%), as was recurrent eosinophilia (3.4 versus 0.7%). UC
      patients with recurrent eosinophilia were predominantly male compared with the
      control UC population (81.3 versus 46.9%) and had higher rates of colectomy for
      either medically refractory disease or dysplasia/cancer than control UC patients 
      (56.3 versus 15.6%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurred in 37.5% of UC
      patients with recurrent eosinophilia compared with only 3.1% in the UC controls. 
      Histological analysis of random diagnostic samples from UC patients with
      recurrent eosinophilia demonstrated a normal eosinophil pattern as seen in the
      control UC population. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia-associated UC is a subgroup of
      IBD associated with severe colitis and PSC. Further studies are warranted to
      characterize molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophilia-associated UC and to
      determine optimal approaches for therapy.

PG  - 683-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCAs) have been detected in the serum of patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and their unaffected family
      members. The aim of this study was to establish the value of serological markers 
      as predictors of UC and CD. DESIGN: Individuals who developed CD or UC were
      identified from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
      (EPIC) study. At recruitment, none of the participants had a diagnosis of CD or
      UC. For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for
      centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of
      cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, 
      perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against
      Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional
      logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating
      characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77
      individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 
      (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively.
      Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in
      predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively).
      The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to
      diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is
      able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Estrogen has been proposed to modulate gut inflammation
      through an effect on estrogen receptors found on gastrointestinal epithelial and 
      immune cells. The role of postmenopausal hormone therapy on risk of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a
      prospective cohort study of 108,844 postmenopausal US women (median age, 54
      years) enrolled in 1976 in the Nurses' Health Study without a prior history of CD
      or UC. Every 2 years, we have updated information on menopause status,
      postmenopausal hormone use, and other risk factors. Self-reported diagnoses of CD
      and UC were confirmed through medical record review by 2 gastroenterologists who 
      were blinded to exposure information. We used Cox proportional hazards models to 
      calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
      RESULTS: Through 2008, with more than 1.8 million person-years of follow-up, we
      documented 138 incident cases of CD and 138 cases of UC. Compared with women who 
      never used hormones, the multivariate-adjusted HR for UC was 1.71 (95% CI,
      1.07-2.74) among women who currently used hormones and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.03-2.66)
      among past users. The risk of UC appeared to increase with longer duration of
      hormone use (P(trend) = .04) and decreased with time since discontinuation. There
      was no difference in risk according to the type of hormone therapy used (estrogen
      vs estrogen plus progestin). In contrast, we did not observe an association
      between current use of hormones and risk of CD (multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.19;
      95% CI, 0.78-1.82). The effect of hormones on risk of UC and CD was not modified 
      by age, body mass index, or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In a large prospective cohort
      of women, postmenopausal hormone therapy was associated with an increased risk of
      UC but not CD. These findings indicate that pathways related to estrogens might
      mediate the pathogenesis of UC.

      Netherlands.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - Our therapeutic goals for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are evolving. Until the last decade the goals were primarily the treatment of
      symptoms. Regulatory approval for ulcerative colitis therapies have been based on
      short-term improvements in clinical indices and, most recently, the ability to
      heal the colonic mucosa, whereas approval for Crohn's disease therapies have been
      based on reductions in the CDAI (Crohn's Disease Activity Index). Over the past
      decade there has been increasing evidence in favor of more 'objective' measures
      of biologic disease activity including biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and 
      mucosal healing in Crohn's disease and the histologic resolution of active
      inflammation in ulcerative colitis. The objective changes have provided expanded 
      therapeutic goals based on longer-term maintenance therapies with the potential
      to modify the chronic disease behavior and to reduce pharmacoeconomic costs
      (reductions in hospitalizations, surgeries and neoplasia).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Long-term data on the influence of cigarette smoking, especially
      cessation, on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      limited. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 229,111 women in the
      Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Biennially, we
      collected updated data on cigarette smoking, other risk factors, and diagnoses of
      CD or UC confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: Over 32 years in NHS and 18
      years in NHS II, we documented 336 incident cases of CD and 400 incident cases of
      UC. Compared with never smokers, the multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of CD was
      1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.53) among current smokers and 1.35
      (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) among former smokers. Increasing pack-years was associated
      with increasing risk of CD (Ptrend < 0.0001), whereas smoking cessation was
      associated with an attenuation of risk. By contrast, the multivariate HR of UC
      was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61-1.20) among current smokers and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.26-1.93)
      among former smokers. The risk of UC was significantly increased within 2-5 years
      of smoking cessation (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.00-4.67) and remained persistently
      elevated over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking is associated with an
      increased risk of CD, but not UC. By contrast, former smoking is associated with 
      an increased risk of UC, with risk persisting over two decades after cessation.

TI  - Management of pediatric ulcerative colitis: joint ECCO and ESPGHAN evidence-based
      consensus guidelines.
PG  - 340-61
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) shares many features with 
      adult-onset disease but there are some unique considerations; therefore,
      therapeutic approaches have to be adapted to these particular needs. We aimed to 
      formulate guidelines for managing UC in children based on a systematic review
      (SR) of the literature and a robust consensus process. The present article is a
      product of a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO)
      and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and
      Nutrition (ESPGHAN). METHODS: A group of 27 experts in pediatric IBD participated
      in an iterative consensus process including 2 face-to-face meetings, following an
      open call to ESPGHAN and ECCO members. A list of 23 predefined questions were
      addressed by working subgroups based on a SR of the literature. RESULTS: A total 
      of 40 formal recommendations and 68 practice points were endorsed with a
      consensus rate of at least 89% regarding initial evaluation, how to monitor
      disease activity, the role of endoscopic evaluation, medical and surgical
      therapy, timing and choice of each medication, the role of combined therapy, and 
      when to stop medications. A management flowchart, based on the Pediatric
      Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), is presented. CONCLUSIONS: These
      guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of UC in
      children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a standardized protocol that 
      allows effective, timely management and monitoring of the disease course, while
      acknowledging that each patient is unique.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that 
      affects primarily the gastrointestinal system but can be associated with
      extraintestinal manifestations. Latent pulmonary involvement in children with CD 
      has been described, but symptomatic pulmonary disease has rarely been reported in
      children. In this review, we report two pediatric cases, one with pleural
      effusion at the time of CD diagnosis and the other with bilateral cavitary
      lesions in a previously diagnosed CD patient. We review the current literature
      and summarize the diagnosis and management of pulmonary involvement in CD.
      Awareness of these pulmonary complications of CD in children may lead to more
      prompt diagnosis, guide appropriate therapy, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Clostridium
      difficile infection in hospitalized children with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) and to compare it to other immunosuppressed patients at risk (oncology
      patients) as well as to immunocompetent patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from 
      all hospitalized children who underwent stool detection of C. difficile toxins A 
      and B (n = 757) in a 5.5-year study period. RESULTS: The number of positive tests
      was significantly increased in the oncology group compared to the IBD group
      (12.45 vs. 6.02%, p = 0.03) and immunocompetent group (12.45 vs. 5.7%, p = 0.01).
      Patients who had C. difficile infection used antibiotics prior to the test more
      often than patients who did not (12.69 vs. 1.73%, p = 0.03). Pearson's
      correlation was positive for C. difficile infection and both antibiotics and
      immunosuppressants, while no correlation was found regarding age and gender.
      There were no significant differences regarding either IBD diagnosis (Crohn's
      disease vs. ulcerative colitis, p = 0.71) or treatment used for IBD (p = 0.53)
      and C. difficile infection. CONCLUSION: In our setting, the incidence of C.
      difficile infection among hospitalized children with active IBD was found to be
      low. Children at increased risk for C. difficile infection were oncology patients
      receiving immunosuppressants and antibiotics.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

TI  - [Postoperative morbidity after bowel resections in patients with Crohn's disease:
      risk, management strategies, prevention].
PG  - 595-600
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1299462 [doi]
AB  - The postoperative morbidity rate following bowel resections for Crohn's disease
      is higher than for other benign disease. The incidence of postoperative
      intraabdominal septic complications (anastomotic leak, bowel fistula,
      intraabdominal abscess, peritonitis) is 5 - 30 %. Preoperative weight loss,
      prolonged refractory symptoms and penetrating disease behaviour are significant
      determinants of postoperative complication risk. Preoperative enteral nutrition, 
      antibiotics, percutaneous abscess drainage and cessation of steroids might reduce
      the risk of surgery, however, more evidence is needed. The intake of
      immunosuppressive agents (mainly, azathioprine) can be continued perioperatively.
      The occurrence of postoperative intraabdominal septic complications is associated
      with an increased risk of surgical recurrence in patients with terminal ileitis, 
      however, the long-term prognosis could be improved in the latter patients by
      secondary fecal diversion. There is no association between postoperative
      morbidity and long-term outcome in patients with Crohn's colitis.

TI  - Is pediatric IBD treatment different than in adults?
PG  - 137-50
AB  - The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to rise in 
      most countries. Approximately 20-25% of IBD patients present before the age of
      20, and their management is associated with many unique challenges. These
      challenges stem both from the inherent differences between children and adults,
      and from the differences in the nature and course of the disease. Children with
      IBD are more likely than adults to present with extensive disease both in Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis requires a high index of
      suspicion, as children may present with less typical signs such as poor growth
      and delayed puberty. In the very young patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 
      the pediatric clinician must consider a broader range of immunological and
      allergic disorders. Optimal management requires recognition of pediatric patterns
      of presentation, efficacy and adverse-effect profiles, and understanding
      monitoring aspects unique to pediatrics. These aspects include pediatric
      disease-related psychological issues, adherence to therapy and transition to
      adult care. Inadequate attention to growth, puberty or bone health in childhood
      can result in long-term consequences, such as impaired adult height and increased
      risk of fractures. Management of pediatric IBD and prevention of adverse
      long-term consequences relies on a variety of therapies well-known to the adult
      practitioner, along with therapies that are not widespread in adults, most
      notably exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). The latter is as effective as
      corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in children, while achieving
      better results than corticosteroids with regard to mucosal healing and growth.
      This review discusses the broad variety of issues that form the basis for
      management of pediatric IBD.

TI  - Ischaemia-induced mucus barrier loss and bacterial penetration are rapidly
      counteracted by increased goblet cell secretory activity in human and rat colon.
PG  - 250-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonic ischaemia is frequently observed in clinical practice. This
      study provides a novel insight into the pathophysiology of colon
      ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) using a newly developed human and rat experimental
      model. DESIGN: In 10 patients a small part of colon that had to be removed for
      surgical reasons was isolated and exposed to 60 min of ischaemia (60I)
      with/without different periods of reperfusion (30R and 60R). Tissue not exposed
      to IR served as control. In rats, colon was exposed to 60I, 60I/30R, 60I/120R or 
      60I/240R (n=7 per group). The tissue was snap-frozen or fixed in glutaraldehyde, 
      formalin or methacarn fixative. Mucins were stained with Periodic Acid
      Schiff/Alcian Blue (PAS/AB) and MUC2/Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA). Bacteria
      were studied using electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescent in situ hybridisation
      (FISH). Neutrophils were studied using myeloperoxidase staining. qPCR was
      performed for MUC2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor
      alpha. RESULTS: In rats, PAS/AB and MUC2/DBA staining revealed mucus layer
      detachment at ischaemia which was accompanied by bacterial penetration (in EM and
      FISH). Human and rat studies showed that, simultaneously, goblet cell secretory
      activity increased. This was associated with expulsion of bacteria from the
      crypts and restoration of the mucus layer at 240 min of reperfusion. Inflammation
      was limited to minor influx of neutrophils and increased expression of
      proinflammatory cytokines during reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic ischaemia
      leads to disruption of the mucus layer facilitating bacterial penetration. This
      is rapidly counteracted by increased secretory activity of goblet cells, leading 
      to expulsion of bacteria from the crypts as well as restoration of the mucus
      barrier.

AB  - To the best of our knowledge, no cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) mimicking
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) have been reported so far. During a 28-year period
      5635 patients were followed up at our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit and 357 had HSP
      according to the European League Against Rheumatism, the Paediatric Rheumatology 
      International Trials Organisation and the Paediatric Rheumatology European
      Society validated classification criteria. At the same period, 148 patients with 
      IBD according to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology
      and Nutrition criteria were followed up at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in
      our University Hospital. Only two of them had vasculitis, as an extra intestinal 
      manifestation of UC mimicking HSP, and fulfilled both disease criteria. A 2-year 
      old girl had bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, arthritis in ankles,
      petechiae and palpable purpura not related to thrombocytopenia in lower limbs. A 
      5-year old boy had bloody diarrhoea, palpable purpura in buttocks, lower limbs,
      penis and scrotum associated with arthritis in knees, orchitis in right testicle 
      and periarticular swelling in hands and feet. Their ileocolonoscopy showed
      diffuse mucosal erythema, oedema, friability and multiple irregular ulcers, and
      histopathological examination of colonic specimen revealed diffuse chronic
      mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion and crypt abscesses suggesting ulcerative 
      colitis. There were no signs of intestinal vasculitis in both cases. In
      conclusion, this is the first study in a paediatric population that evidenced
      palpable purpura associated with UC mimicking HSP.

TI  - Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy in children and adolescents with cancer.
PG  - 450-60
LID - 10.3109/08880018.2012.678568 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Chemotherapy regimes in children with cancer often cause
      gastrointestinal side effects. Only limited data exist on the use of endoscopy in
      this group of patients. METHODS: Retrospective review over a time period of 8.5
      years identified 57 endoscopies (49 upper endoscopies, four colonoscopies, three 
      sigmoidoscopies, one rectoscopy) in 38 patients (mean age 12.8 years). Seventeen 
      children (45%) had hematological malignancies and 21 (55%) had solid tumors. In
      12 children, platelet count was <50 x 10(9)/L and 10 children were neutropenic
      (ANC < 1 x 10(9)/L; absolute neutrophil count). RESULTS: Forty diagnostic
      endoscopies, seven follow-up endoscopies, and 10 therapeutic endoscopies were
      performed. Biopsies were taken in 30 (75%) of 40 diagnostic endoscopies and
      microbiology samples in 17 (42.5%). Pathological findings identified in 33
      (82.5%) diagnostic endoscopies: esophagitis 15 (37.5%)-two of them infections: 1 
      candida, 1 HSV (herpes simplex virus); Mallory-Weiss tears 5 (12.5%); gastritis
      18 (45%; four Helicobacter pylori positive); ulcer 1 (2.5%); duodenitis 11
      (27.5%); neoplasia 3 (7.5%); and colitis 5 (12.5%). Therapeutic endoscopies: Four
      PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube placements, one tube removal, two 
      sclerotherapies for esophageal varices, three nasojejunal tubes for enteral
      nutrition (EN), and three additional tubes in primary diagnostic endoscopies.
      COMPLICATIONS: One episode of fever (>38.5 degrees C) after colonoscopy, one
      localized infection after PEG tube placement, and two episodes of temporary
      desaturation. No association of neutropenia with more infections was observed. No
      bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients was observed. CONCLUSION: The data show
      that endoscopy in high-risk pediatric patients with malignant diseases is a safe 
      procedure. Endoscopy reveals relevant information and have therapeutic impact
      with high probability. Tube placement techniques can help to maintain EN.

TI  - Paediatric nutrition risk scores in clinical practice: children with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 319-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01254.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk
      assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support.
      Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is 
      a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of
      inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition
      screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics
      (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids),
      Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition
      Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease.
      Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health
      Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS:
      There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but
      there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). 
      No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children 
      scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the 
      degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children
      had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high
      risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored
      at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools
      for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential
      to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Structure-function relationships of human milk oligosaccharides.
PG  - 383S-91S
LID - 10.3945/an.111.001404 [doi]
AB  - Human milk contains more than a hundred structurally distinct oligosaccharides.
      In this review, we provide examples of how the structural characteristics of
      these human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) determine functionality. Specific
      alpha1-2-fucosylated HMO have been shown to serve as antiadhesive antimicrobials 
      to protect the breast-fed infant against infections with Campylobacter jejuni,
      one of the most common causes of bacterial diarrhea. In contrast,
      alpha1-2-fucosylation may abolish the beneficial effects of HMO against Entamoeba
      histolytica, a protozoan parasite that causes colitis, acute dysentery, or
      chronic diarrhea. In a different context, HMO need to be both fucosylated and
      sialylated to reduce selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and
      activation, which may protect breast-fed infants from excessive immune responses.
      In addition, our most recent data show that a single HMO that carries not 1 but 2
      sialic acids protects neonatal rats from necrotizing enterocolitis, one of the
      most common and often fatal intestinal disorders in preterm infants.
      Oligosaccharides currently added to infant formula are structurally different
      from the oligosaccharides naturally occurring in human milk. Thus, it appears
      unlikely that they can mimic some of the structure-specific effects of HMO.
      Recent advances in glycan synthesis and isolation have increased the availability
      of certain HMO tri- and tetrasaccharides for in vitro and in vivo preclinical
      studies. In the end, intervention studies are needed to confirm that the
      structure-specific effects observed at the laboratory bench translate into
      benefits for the human infant. Ultimately, breastfeeding remains the number one
      choice to nourish and nurture our infants.

AB  - Combined immunosuppression by immunomodulators and biological therapy has become 
      standard in the medical management of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) because of clearly demonstrated efficacy. Clinical studies,
      registries, and case reports warn of the increased risk of infections,
      particularly opportunistic infections; however, already in the steroid
      monotherapy era, patients are at risk because it is accepted that a patient
      should be considered immunosuppressed when receiving a daily dose of 20 mg of
      prednisone for 2 weeks. Prescriptions increasingly involve azathioprine,
      methotrexate, and various biological agents. The TREAT registry evaluated safety 
      in >6000 adult patients, half of them treated with infliximab (IFX) for about 1.9
      years. IFX-treated patients had an increased risk of infections and this was
      associated with disease severity and concomitant prednisone use. The REACH study,
      evaluating the efficacy of IFX in children with moderate-to-severe Crohn disease,
      refractory to immunomodulatory treatment, reports serious infections as the major
      adverse events and their frequency is higher with shorter treatment intervals.
      The combination of immunosuppressive medications is a risk factor for
      opportunistic infections. Exhaustive guidelines on prophylaxis, diagnosis, and
      management of opportunistic infections in adult patients with IBD have been
      published by a European Crohn's and Colitis Organization working group, including
      clear evidence-based statements. We have reviewed the literature on infections in
      pediatric IBD as well as the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines
      to present a commentary on infection prophylaxis for the pediatric age group.

TI  - The mRNA level of the transforming growth factor beta1 gene, but not the amount
      of the gene product, can be considered as a potential prognostic parameter in
      inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 165-72
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1489-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in cell
      proliferation and differentiation, and it can modulate immune response. In this
      work, we asked whether levels of either TGF-beta1 or mRNA of the corresponding
      gene in plasma or tissue can be useful in diagnosing and/or monitoring of the
      clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: The study group
      consisted of 104 pediatric patients with IBD: 36 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68
      with ulcerative colitis (UC); 42 children represented the control group.
      TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and intestinal mucosa were estimated by ELISA and
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA were
      determined by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In patients with 
      IBD, and in subgroups with CD and UC, no significant differences in the TGF-beta1
      level in plasma and tissue were found relative to the control group. These
      variables were not dependent on the stage of the disease, its activity or
      severity of endoscopic and histopathological findings. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were
      significantly higher in tissue samples withdrawn during the relapse of the
      disease than in those taken during the remission or in the control group.
      However, no correlation between TGF-beta1 plasma levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA amount
      in the intestinal mucosa was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGF-beta1 mRNA level, but
      not the amount of the gene product, was significantly increased in the
      pathologically changed tissue during the relapse of IBD. We suggest that this
      parameter might be considered as a potential prognostic value when assessing IBD 
      in children.

      disease (IBD) observed at the National Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology and Nutrition, and to determine whether the presenting disease
      phenotype and disease outcomes have changed during the past decade. METHODS: The 
      annual incidence of IBD in Irish children aged <16 years was calculated for the
      years 2000-2010. Two subsets of patients, group A (diagnosed between 1 January
      2000 and 31 December 2001), and group B (diagnosed between 1 January and 31
      December 2008) were phenotyped according to the Paris Classification. Phenotype
      at diagnosis and 2-year follow-up were then compared. RESULTS: 406 new cases of
      IBD were identified. The incidence was 2.5/100 000/year in 2001, 7.3 in 2008 and 
      5.6 in 2010, representing a significant increase in the number of new cases of
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There were 238 cases of CD; 129
      of UC; and 39 of IBD unclassified. Comparing groups A and B, no differences were 
      found in disease location at diagnosis or, for CD, in its behaviour. CONCLUSIONS:
      There has been a substantial and sustained increase in the incidence of childhood
      UC and CD in Ireland over a relatively short period of time. However, disease
      phenotype at diagnosis has not changed. At 2 years follow-up, CD appears to
      progress less frequently than in some neighbouring countries. These variations
      remain unexplained. Prospective longitudinal studies will help to elucidate
      further the epidemiology of childhood IBD.

AB  - An abnormal composition of the gut microbiota is believed to be associated with
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We utilized terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis to quantify faecal
      bacterial communities from rats with experimental colitis. Male Sprague Dawley
      rats (n=10/group) ingested 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or water for up to 7
      days. Rats were killed and colonic tissues collected for histological analysis.
      Damage severity score in the distal colon was significantly greater (P<0.001)
      following DSS consumption compared to controls. T-RFLP faecal bacterial profiles 
      generated with either MspI or CfoI revealed a significant difference (P<0.001) in
      community composition between healthy and colitic rats, with bacterial
      composition in healthy rats more variable than in rats with colitis. Operational 
      taxonomic units (OTU: taxonomically related groups of bacteria) associated with
      either the healthy or colitic state were identified. OTU (116, 226, 360, and 948;
      CfoI) and (118 and 188; MspI) were strongly associated with untreated healthy
      rats, while OTU (94, 98, 174, and 384; CfoI) and (94 and 914; MspI) were
      predominantly associated with DSS-treated colitic rats. Phylogenetic OTU
      assignment suggested that Bacteroidales and Lactobacillus sp. were predominantly 
      associated with the colitic and healthy rats, respectively. These results show
      that faecal bacterial profiling is a rapid, sensitive and non-invasive tool for
      detecting and identifying changes in gut microbiota associated with colitis.
      Restoring microbial homeostasis by targeting colitis-associated OTU through
      specific microbiological interventions could form the basis of novel therapeutic 
      strategies for IBD.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      and oral treatment with specific bacteria can ameliorate IBD. One bacterial
      mixture, VSL#3, containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus, was
      clinically shown to reduce inflammation in IBD patients and normalize intestinal 
      levels of IP-10, a lymphocyte-recruiting chemokine, in a murine colitis model. We
      identified Lactobacillus paracasei prtP-encoded lactocepin as a protease that
      selectively degrades secreted, cell-associated, and tissue-distributed IP-10,
      resulting in significantly reduced lymphocyte recruitment after intraperitoneal
      injection in an ileitis model. A human Lactobacillus casei isolate was also found
      to encode lactocepin and degrade IP-10. L. casei feeding studies in a murine
      colitis model (T cell transferred Rag2(-/-) mice) revealed that a prtP-disruption
      mutant was significantly less potent in reducing IP-10 levels, T cell
      infiltration and inflammation in cecal tissue compared to the isogenic wild-type 
      strain. Thus, lactocepin-based therapies may be effective treatments for
      chemokine-mediated diseases like IBD.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can
      affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune
      processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves
      some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children,
      in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with
      similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody
      stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed 
      during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in
      these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be
      especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As
      such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating
      patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a 
      variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved
      endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis 
      and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of
      complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for
      practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks
      and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and
      especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not
      geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the
      management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to
      educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for
      children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans
      between primary care and subspecialty providers.

      diseases.

LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100630 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

AB  - AIM: To investigate all patients referred to our center with non-responsive
      celiac disease (NRCD), to establish a cause for their continued symptoms.
      METHODS: We assessed all patients referred to our center with non-responsive
      celiac disease over an 18-mo period. These individuals were investigated to
      establish the eitiology of their continued symptoms. The patients were first seen
      in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine
      blood work including tissue transglutaminase antibody measurement. They were also
      referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to identift any lapses
      in the diet and sources of hidden gluten ingestion. A repeat small intestinal
      biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital
      where possible. Colonoscopy, lactulose hydrogen breath testing, pancreolauryl
      testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the
      symptoms persisted. Their clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2
      years. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with
      NRCD. Twelve were found not to have celiac disease (CD). Of the remaining 100
      patients, 45% were not adequately adhering to a strict gluten-free diet, with 24 
      (53%) found to be inadvertently ingesting gluten, and 21 (47%) admitting
      non-compliance. Microscopic colitis was diagnosed in 12% and small bowel
      bacterial overgrowth in 9%. Refractory CD was diagnosed in 9%. Three of these
      were diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. After 2 years, 78 patients remained
      well, eight had continuing symptoms, and four had died. CONCLUSION: In
      individuals with NRCD, a remediable cause can be found in 90%: with continued
      gluten ingestion as the leading cause. We propose an algorithm for investigation.

TI  - Mucosal cytokine gene expression profiles as biomarkers of response to infliximab
      in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 538-47
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.667146 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mucosal cytokine profile determines T cell differentiation and may
      play an important role in the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). Cytokines from different T helper (Th) cell subsets are elevated in
      inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), contributing to the
      inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of
      pre-treatment mucosal cytokine profile in response to therapy with the anti-TNF
      agent infliximab (IFX). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression of Th1, Th17, Th2
      and T-regulatory (Treg)-related cytokines was quantified by real-time PCR in
      mucosal biopsies from 74 UC patients before initiation of IFX induction therapy. 
      Clinical and endoscopic effects were assessed after three infusions. Remission
      was defined as ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) below 3.
      RESULTS: Higher gene expression levels of IL-17A and IFN-gamma were significantly
      associated with remission after three IFX infusions (OR = 5.4, p = 0.013 and OR =
      5.5, p = 0.011, respectively). IL-17A and IFN-gamma mRNA expression showed
      positive correlation. Th2 and Treg-related mediators were not significantly
      associated with clinical outcome, but were expressed at higher levels in UC
      patients compared with the controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the
      presence of cells expressing both IL-17A and IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: High
      expression of Th1- and Th17-related cytokines in the mucosa of UC patients can
      potentially predict a favorable outcome of IFX induction therapy. Th2 and
      Treg-related mediators do not appear useful as predictive markers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely
      used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies
      examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD.
      METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed
      retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha
      beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for
      loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed.
      RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or
      indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean
      age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration
      of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the
      cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was
      associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with
      linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001).
      Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly
      (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha
      treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders
      had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha 
      treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the
      effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD.
      Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of
      immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the 
      spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our
      study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the
      United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through 
      codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia,
      etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with
      infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There
      were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, 
      comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis,
      infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition,
      TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold
      greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of
      infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), 
      pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and
      weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were
      also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) 
      and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for
      significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately
      impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C
      difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.

TI  - Decreased mucosal sulfide detoxification is related to an impaired butyrate
      oxidation in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2371-80
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Defective detoxification of sulfides leads to damage to the mucosa
      and may play a role in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). The colonic
      mucosal thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) enzyme removes H(2) S by conversion
      to the less toxic thiocyanate. In this study we measured colonic mucosal TST
      enzyme activity and gene expression in UC and controls. In addition, the
      influence of sulfides on butyrate oxidation was evaluated. METHODS: Colonic
      mucosal biopsies were collected from 92 UC patients and 24 controls. TST activity
      was measured spectrophotometrically. To assess gene expression, total RNA from
      biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was reassessed after their 
      first treatment with infliximab. To evaluate the effect of sulfides on butyrate
      oxidation, biopsies were incubated with 1.5 mM NaHS. RESULTS: TST enzyme activity
      and gene expression were significantly decreased in UC patients vs. controls (P <
      0.001). UC patients, classified into disease activity subgroups, showed a
      significantly decreased TST activity and gene expression in the subgroups as
      compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.05 for all). In 20 patients, gene expression 
      was reassessed after their first infliximab therapy. In responders to infliximab,
      a significant increase in TST gene expression was observed. However, TST mRNA
      levels did not return to control values after therapy in the responders. In
      controls, but not in UC, sulfide significantly decreased butyrate oxidation.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found an impaired detoxification mechanism of sulfide at TST
      protein and RNA level in UC. Inflammation was clearly associated with the
      observed TST deficiency.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - e1030-41
LID - 10.1542/peds.2011-1700 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unintended variation in the care of patients with Crohn disease (CD) 
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) may prevent achievement of optimal outcomes. We
      sought to improve chronic care delivery and outcomes for children with
      inflammatory bowel disease by using network-based quality improvement methods.
      METHODS: By using a modified Breakthrough Series collaborative structure, 6
      ImproveCareNow Network care centers tested changes in chronic illness care and
      collected data monthly. We used an interrupted time series design to evaluate the
      impact of these changes. RESULTS: Data were available for 843 children with CD
      and 345 with UC. Changes in care delivery were associated with an increase in the
      proportion of visits with complete disease classification, measurement of
      thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) before initiation of thiopurines, and
      patients receiving an initial thiopurine dose appropriate to their TPMT status.
      These were significant in both populations for all process variables (P < .01)
      except for measurement of TPMT in CD patients (P = .12). There were significant
      increases in the proportion of CD (55%-68%) and UC (61%-72%) patients with
      inactive disease. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of CD
      patients not taking prednisone (86%-90%). Participating centers varied in the
      success of achieving these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the outcomes of 
      patients with CD and UC were associated with improvements in the process of
      chronic illness care. Variation in the success of implementing changes suggests
      the importance of overcoming organizational factors related to quality
      improvement success.

TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea: a review of pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment
      strategies.
PG  - 130-8
LID - 10.3810/hp.2012.02.953 [doi]
AB  - Diarrhea is a frequent complication among hospitalized patients. Nosocomial
      diarrhea is generally diagnosed as increased frequency and decreased consistency 
      of stools developing after 72 hours of hospitalization. The causes of nosocomial 
      diarrhea may be infectious or noninfectious. Noninfectious etiologies occur most 
      commonly, and are often adverse effects of medications or enteral nutrition
      therapies. Infectious etiologies are most concerning and include Clostridium
      difficile and norovirus. Patients with nosocomial diarrhea should be placed in
      isolation with contact precautions in place until the presence of C difficile
      infection is determined. Irrespective of etiology, diarrhea can cause serious
      complications in hospitalized patients, including malnutrition, hemodynamic
      instability, metabolic acidosis, and potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis. 
      This article reviews nosocomial diarrhea, including its pathophysiology,
      infectious and noninfectious causes, and treatment strategies based on identified
      cause.

PG  - 687-91
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.12.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anaemia and iron deficiency are common in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) however it is not known if the prevalence of
      anaemia and iron deficiency alters following diagnosis. METHODS: Laboratory
      results from diagnosis, and at follow up one and two years later were recorded
      retrospectively in children with IBD recruited from a tertiary centre. Anaemia
      was defined using WHO standards and iron deficiency defined using published
      guidelines. RESULTS: 46 children (16 girls) with Crohn's disease and 34 children 
      (18 girls) with UC were studied. 75% of children with IBD were anaemic at
      diagnosis, 30% were anaemic at follow up two years later. 90% of children with
      Crohn's and 95% of children with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) were iron deficient at
      diagnosis. At follow up two years later 70% of children with Crohn's and 65% of
      children with UC were iron deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent anaemia and iron
      deficiency are common in childhood IBD, prevalence alters with duration of time
      from diagnosis.

TI  - Low-dose smoking resumption in ex-smokers with refractory ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 756-62
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.12.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is primarily a disease of
      non-smokers. Ex-smokers may have a more refractory disease course and anecdotal
      evidence in non-controlled clinical trials have suggested that smoking
      resumption, or the administration of nicotine, may ameliorate signs and symptoms 
      of UC in ex-smokers. We report outcomes of ex-smokers with refractory UC who
      resumed low-dose cigarette smoking. METHODS: 17 ex-smokers with refractory UC
      were identified. Clinical remission was defined as a disease activity index score
      of 0. RESULTS: Two out of 17 patients refused the recommendation to resume
      smoking. Of the 15 patients who resumed smoking, the mean daily number of
      cigarettes was 8.6. Fourteen out of those 15 patients who resumed smoking were
      able to maintain prolonged clinical remission off steroids. One out of the 15
      patients failed to improve and required oral steroids. Another patient was
      compelled to quit smoking since he became addicted. His disease flared after
      maintaining a prolonged remission of 3 years and he eventually underwent surgery.
      Three out of these 15 patients switched from cigarettes smoking to nicotine
      compounds and continued to maintain remission. CONCLUSION: Resumption of low dose
      smoking in a selected group of ex-smokers with refractory UC may ameliorate signs
      and symptoms. Quality of life, medication side effects, and smoking risk factors 
      should all be considered and discussed with patients. Smokers should be
      meticulously followed for compliance with "low-dose" regimen and all associated
      smoking risks.

TI  - Vitamin D as a therapy for colitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 405-11
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.01.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on immune disorders
      has been a topical research focus. The aim of this systematic review was to
      examine the current evidence of the effect of vitamin D supplementation as a
      therapy for colitis. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE,
      Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials using the terms 'inflammatory bowel disease'
      'Crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'colitis' [and] 'vitamin D'. Both human
      and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference
      lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any
      relevant studies. RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. 
      All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation.
      The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse
      rate for Crohn's disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation
      were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some evidence that supplemental
      vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this
      evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials
      are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.

TI  - Use of small bowel MRI enteroclysis in the management of paediatric IBD.
PG  - 550-6
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.10.014 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently present
      with small bowel involvement at some stage of their disease. Hence, reliable
      assessment of the entire small bowel is required in order to adjust treatment
      accordingly. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the small bowel in
      combination with luminal contrast agent delivered via a naso-jejunal tube (MR
      enteroclysis) is an emerging technique demonstrating good results in adult
      patients. However, data on its use and benefits in children is limited. AIMS: In 
      this study we report our experience on performing small bowel MR enteroclysis
      (MRE) in children with IBD. Specifically, we reviewed indications, MR findings,
      advantages and disadvantages of the technique in a tertiary unit. METHODS: A
      total of 34 MRE studies (29 paediatric IBD patients) were retrospectively
      analysed. All patients underwent upper and lower endoscopy under general
      anaesthetic (GA) the day before MR imaging was performed. Nasojejunal (NJ)-tube
      was placed during endoscopy. RESULTS: Frequently detected findings included small
      and large bowel wall thickening, small bowel strictures and intestinal lymph node
      enlargement. Importantly, in all our clinical cases, MRE results were key to
      making a clinical decision in the given scenario regardless of whether MRE
      findings were positive or negative. CONCLUSIONS: Within our setup, MR
      enteroclysis is a well-tolerated, sensitive technique for small bowel imaging,
      providing detailed information at crucial clinical decision points. Moreover,
      accurate information then allows appropriate clinical decisions to be made.

TI  - Preoperative immunosuppression is not associated with increased postoperative
      complications following colectomy in children with colitis.
PG  - 421-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to review postoperative
      complications of pediatric patients undergoing colectomy for ulcerative colitis
      (UC) or inflammatory bowel disease-unspecified (IBD-U) with a focus on
      preoperative immunosuppression including exposure to infliximab. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective chart review of all of the children with UC or IBD-U
      undergoing colectomy at our institution from 1996 to 2010. Data collected
      included indication for colectomy, immunosuppressive medications taken within 30 
      to 90 days of colectomy, surgical techniques and staging, and early and late
      postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients underwent colectomy 
      (45 UC, 6 IBD-U) (55% male, 63% pancolitis at diagnosis, mean age at diagnosis
      10.8 +/- 3.8 years, mean age at colectomy 13.1 +/- 3.8 years). Indications for
      colectomy were fulminant colitis in 26% and medically refractory chronic disease 
      in 74%. Patient exposure to immunosuppression in the 30 days before colectomy
      included corticosteroids (88%), thiopurines (51%), and calcineurin inhibitors
      (4%). Within 90 days before colectomy, 65% of patients were exposed to
      infliximab. Small bowel obstruction was the most common postoperative
      complication, occurring in 19% (treated surgically in 30%), followed by wound
      infection in 8% and intraabdominal abscess in 6%. One patient developed
      postoperative sepsis. There was no increased incidence of early or late
      infectious or noninfectious complications in those patients taking or not taking 
      thiopurines or calcineurin inhibitors (within 30 days), or infliximab (within 90 
      days). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative exposure to thiopurines or calcineurin
      inhibitors (within 30 days) or infliximab (within 90 days) was not associated
      with increased postoperative complications in our cohort undergoing colectomy for
      UC or IBD-U.

TI  - Geriatric inflammatory bowel disease: phenotypic presentation, treatment
      patterns, nutritional status, outcomes, and comorbidity.
PG  - 2408-15

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The U.S. population is aging and the burden of geriatric
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has increased. Systematic data
      describing phenotypic presentation, treatment regimens, outcomes and
      comorbidities in elderly IBD patients is limited. We performed a retrospective
      observational study of IBD patients age >/=65 followed in a 20-hospital system to
      determine patterns of phenotypic presentation, treatment, polypharmacy,
      nutritional status and comorbidity. METHODS: Data were extracted from electronic 
      medical record based on ICD-9 coding/indexed terms on Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. RESULTS: A total of 393 geriatric IBD patients 
      were identified (49.1% males; 50.9% females; 61.8% UC; 38.2% CD; 73.4 +/- 6.6
      years old). Younger age at diagnosis of CD (</=64) was associated with greater
      prevalence of small bowel surgeries (63.6%) compared with those diagnosed after
      age >/=65 (20.9%) (p < 0.005). Fistulizing/penetrating disease was frequent in
      patients diagnosed with CD at a younger age (43.6% compared to 7%) (p < 0.005).
      IBD maintenance treatment included: 44% 5-ASA agents; 31.6% maintenance
      prednisone (defined as >/=6 months treatment duration); 4.8% steroid
      suppositories; 5.6% 6MP/azathioprine; 1.3% methotrexate; 1.3% adalimumab; 1.3%
      infliximab; 9.4% loperamide/diphenoxylate/atropine; 0.5% had no IBD medications. 
      Longer duration of CD disease correlated with vitamin B12, vitamin D and iron
      deficiency. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients diagnosed with CD earlier in life had 
      greater small bowel involvement compared with new onset geriatric CD. There is
      low utilization of immunomodulator and biologic agents in geriatric IBD patients.
      Duration of CD correlates with nutrient deficiency. Prospective studies are
      warranted in this respect.

TI  - Characterization of a probiotic-derived soluble protein which reveals a mechanism
      of preventive and treatment effects of probiotics on intestinal inflammatory
      diseases.
PG  - 25-8
LID - 10.4161/gmic.19245 [doi]
AB  - The beneficial effects of probiotics have been demonstrated in many diseases,
      such as inflammatory bowel disease. The known mechanisms for probiotic action
      include blocking pathogenic bacterial effects, enhancing the innate immunity and 
      decreasing pathogen-induced inflammation, and promoting intestinal epithelial
      cell survival, barrier function, and protective responses. We purified and cloned
      a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived soluble protein, p40. This protein
      ameliorated cytokine-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells through
      activation of the EGF receptor and its down-stream target, Akt. By using special 
      hydrogel beads to protect p40 from degradation, we showed that p40 reduced
      intestinal epithelial apoptosis and preserved barrier function in the colon
      epithelium in an EGF receptor-dependent manner, thereby preventing and treating
      intestinal inflammation in mouse models of colitis. Further works regarding
      structural analysis of p40, regulation of EGF receptor activation and
      immunoregulatory effects by p40 are discussed. These results may provide insights
      into the clinical application of probiotics for intestinal inflammatory
      disorders.

PG  - 166-73
LID - 10.1007/s11894-012-0249-5 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease encompasses a spectrum of disease phenotype,
      severity, and responsiveness to treatment. Intestinal healing rather than merely 
      symptom control is an especially important therapeutic goal in young patients,
      given the potential for growth impairment as a direct effect of persistent
      chronic inflammation and the long life ahead, during which other disease
      complications may occur. Corticosteroids achieve rapid symptom control, but
      alternate steroid-sparing strategies with greater potential to heal the intestine
      must be rapidly adopted. Exclusive enteral nutrition is an alternate short-term
      treatment in pediatric Crohn's disease. The results of multi-center pediatric
      clinical trials of both infliximab and adalimumab in Crohn's disease and of
      infliximab in ulcerative colitis (all in children with unsatisfactory responses
      to other therapies) have now been reported and guide treatment regimens in
      clinical practice. Optimal patient selection and timing of anti-TNF therapy
      requires clinical judgment. Attention must be paid to sustaining responsiveness
      safely.

TI  - Role of fecal calprotectin testing to predict relapse in teenagers with
      inflammatory bowel disease who report full disease control.
PG  - 2018-25
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease undergo regular follow-up
      visits to watch for symptoms that may indicate relapse. Current disease activity 
      is frequently estimated with the use of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). We
      examined the capacity of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) to
      predict relapse in teenagers who report no symptoms. Second, we examined whether 
      calprotectin and CRP as an "add-on test" improve the specificity of PUCAI or
      PCDAI to predict relapse. METHODS: We collected data of 62 consecutive teenagers 
      (31 with Crohn's disease and 31 with ulcerative colitis) who scored their degree 
      of disease control between 90 and 100% on two successive outpatient clinic
      visits. Calprotectin, PUCAI or PCDAI, and CRP were measured at baseline. Primary 
      outcome was symptomatic relapse within 3 months of baseline, necessitating the
      introduction of steroids, exclusive enteral nutrition, or an aminosalicylate dose
      escalation. RESULTS: Fifteen teenagers (24%) developed symptomatic relapse within
      3 months of baseline. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the
      optimum calprotectin cutpoint to differentiate high from low risk patients was
      500 mug/g. The PUCAI or PCDAI predicted relapse in 42% (11/26) of teenagers with 
      a positive result (score >/= 10 points), while a negative PUCAI or PCDAI result
      reduced the risk of relapse to 11% (4/36). Teenagers with a positive calprotectin
      test had a 53% (10/19) risk of progressing to symptomatic relapse within 3
      months, whereas a negative calprotectin result gave a 12% (5/43) risk of
      symptomatic relapse. A positive CRP result (cutoff 10 mg/L) gave a 50% (4/8) risk
      of relapse, whereas a negative CRP result hardly reduced the risk compared with
      the pretest probability (from 24% to 21% (11/53)). As an add-on test after PUCAI 
      or PCDAI, the calprotectin test limited the number of false positives and thus
      increased the specificity to detect gastrointestinal inflammation: 60% (9/15) of 
      teenagers with positive concordant test results progressed to symptomatic
      relapse. Negative concordance reduced the risk of relapse to 10% (3/32). CRP
      contributed little as add-on test after PUCAI or PCDAI: two of five teenagers
      with positive concordant tests progressed to symptomatic relapse (40%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Unlike CRP, fecal calprotectin as an add-on test after PUCAI or
      PCDAI facilitates recognition of preclinical relapse. This could help to identify
      teenagers who require treatment intensification at the time of minimal disease
      rather than at the time of clinically overt relapse. Further studies are
      warranted to determine the impact of fecal calprotectin testing on treatment
      management and outcome.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of early colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastamosis versus
      standard medical therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 117-24
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182445321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases are costly chronic gastrointestinal
      diseases. We aimed to determine whether immediate colectomy with ileal pouch-anal
      anastamosis (IPAA) after diagnosis of severe ulcerative colitis (UC) was
      cost-effective compared to the standard medical therapy. METHODS: We created a
      Markov model simulating 2 cohorts of 21-year-old patients with severe UC,
      following them until 100 years of age or death, comparing early colectomy with
      IPAA strategy to the standard medical therapy strategy. Deterministic and
      probabilistic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Standard medical care accrued a
      discounted lifetime cost of $236,370 per patient. In contrast, early colectomy
      with IPAA accrued a discounted lifetime cost of $147,763 per patient. Lifetime
      quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALY-gained) for standard medical therapy was
      20.78, while QALY-gained for early colectomy with IPAA was 20.72. The resulting
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (Deltacosts/DeltaQALY) was approximately
      $1.5 million per QALY-gained. Results were robust to one-way sensitivity analyses
      for all variables in the model. Quality-of-life after colectomy with IPAA was the
      most sensitive variable impacting cost-effectiveness. A low utility value of less
      than 0.7 after colectomy with IPAA was necessary for the colectomy with IPAA
      strategy to be cost-ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Under the appropriate clinical
      settings, early colectomy with IPAA after diagnosis of severe UC reduces health
      care expenditures and provides comparable quality of life compared to exhaustive 
      standard medical therapy.

TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on paracellular permeability in the gut.
PG  - 104-17
LID - 10.3390/nu3010104 [doi]
AB  - Paracellular permeability is determined by the complex structures of junctions
      that are located between the epithelial cells. Already in 1996, it was shown that
      the human probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and the rat-originating
      strain Lactobacillus reuteri R2LC could reduce this permeability in a
      methotrexate-induced colitis model in the rat. Subsequently, many animal models
      and cell culture systems have shown indications that lactobacilli are able to
      counteract increased paracellular permeability evoked by cytokines, chemicals,
      infections, or stress. There have been few human studies focusing on the effect
      of lactobacilli on intestinal paracellular permeability but recently it has been 
      shown that they could influence the tight junctions. More precisely, short-term
      administration of L. plantarum WCSF1 to healthy volunteers increased the
      relocation of occludin and ZO-1 into the tight junction area between duodenal
      epithelial cells.

TI  - Aluminum as an adjuvant in Crohn's disease induction.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1177/0961203311430090 [doi]
AB  - Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a
      ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water,
      waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of
      aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal
      inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet
      unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of
      inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the
      immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be
      adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared
      cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and
      stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota,
      trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The
      inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology.
      It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of
      innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted
      with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound
      surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic
      criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by
      adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the
      consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.

TI  - Hybrid procedures of restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis for large bowel disorders.
PG  - 537-40
LID - 10.2478/v10035-011-0085-6 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to describe the authors' experience in
      performing laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with the formation of an
      intestinal reservoir of the J-pouch type, anal anastomosis and protective
      ileostomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2011, a total of 23 patients
      underwent laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy with the formation of an
      intestinal reservoir of the J-pouch type, anal anastomosis and protective
      ileostomy for ulcerative colitis (n = 17) or familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 
      6). A statistical analysis of the treatment outcomes was performed. RESULTS: No
      intraoperative complications were observed and none of the patients required
      conversion or blood transfusions. The mean duration of the procedure was 4.08
      hours (2.5-6.0 hours). The mean duration of hospitalization was 15.4 days (8-24
      days). We observed three major postoperative complications requiring
      intervention: two cases of small bowel obstruction (one due to postoperative
      adhesions and the other due to volvulus) and one case of infection of the
      surgical and ostomy wound healed following ileostomy closure. CONCLUSIONS: For
      such extensive procedures as restorative proctocolectomy, laparoscopic techniques
      prove safe and are characterised by a better patient acceptance thanks to the low
      invasiveness and good cosmetic effects. The technological progress and the
      increasing experience in performing laparoscopy provide more and more arguments
      to support the selection of this method as the preferred method of treatment.

TI  - Glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius inhibit colitis-associated
      colon carcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - 504-18
LID - 10.1007/s00535-011-0514-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recently demonstrated that polysaccharides from fruiting body
      extract (FBE) or mycelia extract (ME) of the edible mushroom Pleurotus
      pulmonarius exert antiproliferative effects in intestinal cells and an
      anti-inflammatory effect in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of fungal FBE and ME in
      colon carcinogenesis. METHODS: In vitro, human colorectal cancer cells were
      treated with FBE and ME and analyzed for inflammation response, for markers of
      apoptosis, and for cell-cycle progression. In vivo, FBE and ME were tested in a
      mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis induced by cyclic
      treatments with DSS and azoxymethane. Treated mice were fed a daily diet
      containing 2 or 20 mg FBE or ME per mouse for 80 days. RESULTS: In vitro, FBE and
      ME induced apoptosis in a dose-responsive manner and modulated the expression of 
      Bcl-2, Bax, and cytochrome c, and blocked tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha-induced inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF) (Ikappa)-Balpha degradation 
      and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. In vivo, dietary administration of FBE and
      ME significantly reduced the formation of aberrant crypt foci, which precedes
      colorectal cancer, and of microadenomas. The treatments significantly lowered the
      expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increased the number of
      cells undergoing apoptosis in the colon. Additionally, FBE and ME inhibited the
      expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in colonic tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that P. pulmonarius FBE and ME inhibit
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced in mice through the modulation of
      cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of inflammation.

TI  - Alterations in the gut microbiome of children with severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1799-808
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22860 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the role of microbes in disease pathogenesis is well
      established, data describing the variability of the vast microbiome in children
      diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) are lacking. This study characterizes the 
      gut microbiome in hospitalized children with severe UC and determines the
      relationship between microbiota and response to steroid therapy. METHODS: Fecal
      samples were collected from 26 healthy controls and 27 children hospitalized with
      severe UC as part of a prospective multicenter study. DNA extraction, polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA, and microarray
      hybridization were performed. Results were analyzed in GeneSpring GX 11.0
      comparing healthy controls with children with UC, and steroid responsive (n = 17)
      with nonresponsive patients (n = 10). RESULTS: Bacterial signal strength and
      distribution showed differences between UC and healthy controls (adjusted P <
      0.05) for Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Phylospecies levels with
      reduction in Clostridia and an increase in Gamma-proteobacteria. The number of
      microbial phylospecies was reduced in UC (266 +/- 69) vs. controls (758 +/- 3, P 
      < 0.001), as was the Shannon Diversity Index (6.1 +/- 0.23 vs. 6.49 +/- 0.04,
      respectively; P < 0.0001). Steroid nonresponders harbored fewer phylospecies than
      responders (142 +/- 49 vs. 338 +/- 62, P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Richness,
      evenness, and biodiversity of the gut microbiome were remarkably reduced in
      children with UC compared with healthy controls. Children who did not respond to 
      steroids harbored a microbiome that was even less rich than steroid responders.
      This study is the first to characterize the gut microbiome in a large cohort of
      pediatric patients with severe UC and describes changes in the gut microbiome as 
      a potential prognostic feature.

TI  - Induction and maintenance therapy with infliximab for children with moderate to
      severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 391-9.e1
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2011.11.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of infliximab for
      inducing and maintaining benefit in children with moderately to severely active
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Patients (6-17 years old) who had active UC
      (Mayo scores of 6-12; endoscopic subscores >/= 2) and had not responded to or
      tolerated conventional treatment were given 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and
      6. The primary end point was response at week 8 (decreases in Mayo scores >/= 30%
      and >/= 3 points and decreases in rectal bleeding subscores of >/= 1 or an
      absolute subscore of </= 1). At week 8, only responders were randomly assigned to
      groups given infliximab every 8 or 12 weeks (q8w or q12w) and followed through
      week 54. Maintenance end points included pediatric UC activity index scores <10
      points, defined as remission. RESULTS: At week 8, infliximab induced a response
      in 73.3% of patients (44 of 60) (95% confidence interval, 62.1%-84.5%; a positive
      result was defined by 95% confidence interval lower limit >40%). Among
      responders, twice as many were in remission at week 54 after q8w (8 of 21, 38.1%)
      than q12w (4 of 22, 18.2%; P = .146) therapy. Assuming the q8w remission rate for
      responders, the overall remission rate at week 54 would be 28.6%. Serious adverse
      events and infusion reactions occurred in similar proportions in the q8w and q12w
      groups. No deaths, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or
      delayed hypersensitivity reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was
      safe and effective, inducing a response at week 8 in 73.3% of pediatric patients 
      with moderate to severely active UC who did not respond to conventional therapy. 
      The overall remission rate at week 54 for all enrolled patients was 28.6%,
      assuming the more effective q8w remission rate.

TI  - Clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease in children do not correlate
      with four common polymorphisms of the transforming growth factor beta1 gene.
PG  - 641-4
AB  - Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a cytokine affecting cell
      proliferation and development, which also has an immunomodulatory activity.
      Correlations between polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene and clinical parameters 
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported previously in adults. Here, we 
      tested whether such correlations occur in pediatric patients suffering from IBD. 
      One hundred and four pediatric IBD patients were involved in this study. Among
      them, 36 were diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (CD) and 68 were diagnosed with
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The control group consisted of 103 children, in which
      IBD was excluded. TGF-beta1 levels were determined in plasma and intestinal
      mucosa samples. The presence of the TGF beta1 protein and the amount of TGF beta1
      mRNA were estimated in intestinal mucosa by immunohistochemistry and reverse
      transcription Real-Time PCR, respectively. Four common polymorphisms of the
      TGF-beta1 gene were investigated: -800G/A, -509C/T, 869T/C and 915G/C. No
      significant correlation between TGF-beta1 genotypes and (i) TGF-beta1 levels in
      plasma and tissue samples, (ii) TGF-beta1 gene expression efficiency in
      intestinal mucosa, (iii) IBD clinical parameters and (iv) inflammatory activity
      could be detected in children suffering from IBD. We conclude that, contrary to
      previous suggestions, the four common polymorphisms of the TGF-beta1 gene do not 
      influence the susceptibility to or clinical parameters of IBD in the tested
      population of children.

TI  - Relevance of protein fermentation to gut health.
PG  - 184-96
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100542 [doi]
AB  - It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial
      effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids,
      whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health.
      Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get
      depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as
      ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these
      metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some
      important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis
      appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein
      fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat
      are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society.
      Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also
      induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also
      play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the
      relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly 
      investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity 
      of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be
      summarized.

PG  - 24-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32834c453e [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes
      in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems.
      This review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal
      pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A 
      number of intestinal pathogens including Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter species
      are associated at fairly high prevalence with Crohn's disease, while two recent
      studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. In a prospective study, M.
      avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early Crohn's disease was low and 
      comparable to controls, while much higher in an established inflammatory bowel
      disease cohort. In the pediatric setting, a high prevalence of Clostridium
      difficile was seen in both active and inactive Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients. Some studies have speculated that Salmonella or Campylobacter
      infection may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on long-term
      follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure the risk. Recent studies in
      mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of factors, including viral
      pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal microflora, can lead to
      intestinal pathology. SUMMARY: No evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel
      disease by a single agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been 
      strongly associated with the presence of disease. The majority of recent studies 
      support a role for the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic
      inflammation in individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other
      environmental factors which remain to be identified. These factors may include
      subsets of commensal microflora.

PG  - 414-7
LID - 10.4103/1319-3767.87185 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorder of colon.
      Frequency of UC is gradually increasing over few years worldwide. Prevalence is
      35 to 100/100,000 people in USA, 1% of them are infants. UC develops in a
      genetically predisposed individual with altered intestinal immune response. An
      eight-month-old girl presented with loose bloody stool, growth failure, and
      moderate pallor. The girl was diagnosed as a case of UC by colonoscopy and
      biopsy. Treatment was thereafter started with immunosuppressive drugs. After
      initial induction therapy with parenteral steroid and infliximab, the patient is 
      now on remission with azathioprine and mesalamine. UC is rare in Bangladesh,
      especially in children, and it is rarer during infancy. Several conditions like
      infective colitis, allergic colitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, Crohn's disease,
      etc. may mimic the features of UC. So, if a child presents with recurrent bloody 
      diarrhea, UC should be considered as differential diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology behind
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) although the exact mechanism is far from fully
      understood. In the era of new technology, over the last years molecular
      approaches have shed light on the inflammatory mechanisms and their metabolic end
      products. This opens for a molecular fingerprinting that can be used in the
      biomarker field of IBD. There is a great need of biomarkers for prediction of
      clinical outcome and prognostic biomarker for prediction of therapeutic effects
      in IBD. Although the biomarker concept is old, so far very few really useful
      biomarkers exist in IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here, we review the predictive and
      prognostic biomarkers in IBD in the era of new technologies with emphasis on the 
      potential of molecular fingerprinting. RESULTS: Very few candidate biomarkers
      have been documented. The most promising candidate predictor is tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, but there is a lack of validation. CONCLUSION: So far, there are
      few biomarkers documented in IBD, but we are at the start of a new scientific
      field that will be of great value for the handling of the disease.

TI  - Functional analysis of colonic bacterial metabolism: relevant to health?
PG  - G1-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00048.2011 [doi]
AB  - With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of
      major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota.
      In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize
      microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of
      microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial
      metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven
      targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from
      carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g.,
      p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes.
      The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant
      solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down
      approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based
      on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites
      and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal
      samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory
      processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can
      function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal 
      diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future
      research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites 
      and different disease states.

TI  - Induction of dsRNA-activated protein kinase links mitochondrial unfolded protein 
      response to the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 1269-1278
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300767 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) feature multiple cellular stress
      responses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein responses
      (UPRs). UPRs represent autoregulatory pathways that adjust organelle capacity to 
      cellular demand. A similar mechanism, mitochondrial UPR (mtUPR), has been
      described for mitochondria. ER UPR in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
      contributes to the development of intestinal inflammation, and since
      mitochondrial alterations and dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      IBDs, the authors characterised mtUPR in the context of intestinal inflammation. 
      METHODS: Truncated ornithine transcarbamylase was used to selectively induce
      mtUPR in a murine IEC line. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) was administered to PKR
      (double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase) knockout mice to induce IEC stress
      in vivo and to test for their susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Expression
      levels of the mitochondrial chaperone chaperonin 60 (CPN60) and PKR were
      quantified in IECs from patients with IBDs and from murine models of colitis
      using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Selective mtUPR
      induction by truncated ornithine transcarbamylase transfection triggered the
      phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha and cJun
      through the recruitment of PKR. Using pharmacological inhibitors and small
      inhibitory RNA, the authors identified mtUPR-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and transcription factor activation (cJun/AP1) as being dependent on the
      activities of the mitochondrial protease ClpP and the cytoplasmic kinase PKR.
      Pkr(-/-) mice failed to induce CPN60 in IECs upon DSS treatment at early time
      points and subsequently showed an almost complete resistance to DSS-induced
      colitis. Under inflammatory conditions, primary IECs from patients with IBDs and 
      two murine models of colitis exhibited a strong induction of the mtUPR marker
      protein CPN60 associated with enhanced expression of PKR. CONCLUSION: PKR
      integrates mtUPR into the disease-relevant ER UPR via eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and AP1 activation. Induction of mtUPR and PKR was observed in IECs from murine
      models and patients with IBDs. The authors' results indicate that PKR might link 
      mitochondrial stress to intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Impaired butyrate oxidation in ulcerative colitis is due to decreased butyrate
      uptake and a defect in the oxidation pathway.
PG  - 1127-36
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate metabolism is impaired due to a
      defect in the butyrate oxidation pathway and/or transport. In the present study
      we correlated butyrate uptake and oxidation to the gene expression of the
      butyrate transporter SLC16A1 and the enzymes involved in butyrate oxidation
      (ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2) in UC and controls. METHODS: Colonic
      mucosal biopsies were collected during endoscopy of 88 UC patients and 20
      controls with normal colonoscopy. Butyrate uptake and oxidation was measured by
      incubating biopsies with (14) C-labeled Na-butyrate. To assess gene expression,
      total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was
      reassessed after treatment with infliximab. RESULTS: Butyrate uptake and
      oxidation were significantly decreased in UC versus controls (P < 0.001 for
      both). Butyrate oxidation remained significantly reduced in UC after correction
      for butyrate uptake (P < 0.001), suggesting that the butyrate oxidation pathway
      itself is also affected. Also, the mucosal gene expression of SLC16A1, ACSM3,
      ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2 was significantly decreased in UC as compared
      with controls (P < 0.001 for all). In a subgroup of patients (n = 20), the gene
      expression was reassessed after infliximab therapy. In responders to therapy, a
      significant increase in gene expression was observed. Nevertheless, only ACSM3
      mRNA levels returned to control values after therapy in the responders groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The deficiency in the colonic butyrate metabolism in UC is initiated
      at the gene expression level and is the result of a decreased expression of
      SLC16A1 and enzymes in the beta-oxidation pathway of butyrate.

      colitis.
PG  - 1112-26
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21879 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are considered important in
      maintaining physiological homeostasis in many systems. Their expression is
      altered greatly in several pathophysiological conditions. Herein, we assess the
      expression and cellular localization of HSPGs in two murine models of human
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Expression and localization of HSPGs, 
      syndecans, and HS epitopes were examined in the colon of 129SvEv interleukin 10
      knockout (IL10(-/-)), C3Bir IL10(-/-), and their genetic control (IL10(+/+))
      counterparts (129SvEv; C3H/HeJ). mRNA expression of syndecans and heparan sulfate
      biosynthesis enzymes were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Localization of HSPGs was determined by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: mRNA for all
      syndecans was detected and expression in colonic tissues altered in IL10(-/-)
      mice. Syndecan-1 protein was expressed in the intestinal epithelium and on lamina
      propria cells of IL10(-/-) and control mice but was significantly reduced on the 
      intestinal epithelial cells of IL10(-/-), mice particularly with severe colitis. 
      Syndecan-2 was not detected, whereas syndecan-3 immunoreactivity was localized in
      the lamina propria but did not differ between control and IL10(-/-) mice.
      Syndecan-4 was present on epithelial cells of all mice but was significantly
      reduced in IL10(-/-) mice. Differences in the expression of HS epitopes between
      control and IL10(-/-) mice were also confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The study has
      revealed altered expression of syndecan-1 and -4 and HS epitopes in the gut of
      mice with an IBD-like gut disorder. The IL10(-/-) mouse is a useful model for
      further study of the functional role of HSPGs in chronic inflammation and in
      maintaining healthy gut barrier.

TI  - Medical radiation exposure in children with inflammatory bowel disease estimates 
      high cumulative doses.
PG  - 2326-32
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21626 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergo imaging using 
      ionizing radiation and may be exposed to high cumulative radiation. We
      hypothesized that children with IBD have high exposure to radiation from medical 
      imaging. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective
      chart review from 2002-2008 was performed on all patients with IBD. Radiographic 
      studies performed were recorded and exposure for each study was estimated.
      RESULTS: A total of 117 children with IBD (86 Crohn's disease [CD], 31 ulcerative
      colitis [UC]) were evaluated. The median current exposure was 15.1 mSv in CD and 
      7.2 mSv in UC (P = 0.005). Computed tomography (CT) scan and small bowel
      follow-through (SBFT) were responsible for 43% and 36% of all radiation
      exposures, respectively. The rate of radiation was higher in CD compared to UC
      (4.3 versus 2.2 mSv/yr). In CD, the rate of exposure was highest in the first 3
      years of diagnosis (8.2 mSv/yr), and no different between the 3-5 year follow-up 
      and 5+ year follow-up groups (3.8 versus 4.3 mSv/yr). Using the annual dose rate 
      in those followed for more than 3 years, an estimated 47 out of 78 (60%) children
      (40 CD, 7 UC) would exceed 50 mSv by 35 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation
      exposure from medical imaging is high in a subset of children diagnosed with IBD.
      Estimation of radiation exposure at age 35 suggests a significant portion of
      children with IBD will have high radiation exposure in their lifetime.
      Nonionizing imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound
      should be offered to children with IBD as an alternative to current imaging that 
      employs radiation.

PG  - 1173-84

AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of association between homocysteine metabolism and
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains unknown, whereas the association
      between hyperhomocysteinaemia and thrombosis remains controversial in IBD. AIM:
      To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine these issues.
      METHODS: The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE database and
      international conference abstracts from January 1966 to April 2011 and included
      all studies that evaluated plasma homocysteine level in IBD. RESULTS:
      Twenty-eight studies evaluated the plasma homocysteine level and/or
      hyperhomocysteinaemia risk in IBD patients. Five studies assessed the association
      of hyperhomocysteinaemia with thrombosis. The mean plasma homocysteine level was 
      significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls (weighted mean
      difference (WMD)=3.75 mumol/L; 95% CI, 2.23-5.26 mumol/L; P<0.0001; reference
      ranges for plasma homocysteine level: 5-12 mumol/L). The mean plasma homocysteine
      level did not differ between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)
      (WMD=0.41 mumol/L; 95% CI, -2.45 to 3.06 mumol/L; P=0.76). The risk of
      hyperhomocysteinaemia was significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with
      controls [odds ratio (OR)=4.65; 95% CI, 3.04-7.09; P<0.0001]. The risk of
      hyperhomocysteinaemia was not higher among IBD patients who experienced
      thromboembolic complications (OR=1.97; 95% CI, 0.83-4.67; P=0.12). Plasma folate 
      level was inversely correlated with IBD risk associated with MTHFR C677T
      polymorphism (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia is
      significantly higher in IBD patients when compared with controls. The risk
      assessment of hyperhomocysteinaemia-related thrombosis in IBD requires further
      investigation. Deficient folate status is associated with a higher impact of
      MTHFR C677T polymorphism on IBD risk.

PG  - 203-10

AB  - Increased levels of homocysteine are found systemically and in intestinal mucosa 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and, specifically, in ulcerative
      colitis (UC). However, there are controversial reports regarding the factors
      contributing to increased levels of homocysteine in UC. Furthermore, little
      information is available regarding the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia 
      (HHcy), vitamin status, and genetic polymorphisms of homocysteine-related enzymes
      in these patients. This study examined four functional polymorphisms linked to
      homocysteine metabolism (MTHFR C677T and A1298C, MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G), and
      evaluated plasma levels of homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B(12) in 310
      consecutive patients with UC and 936 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from
      southeast China. The variant allele and genotypic frequencies in MTHFR A1298C,
      MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G genes were significantly higher in patients with UC
      compared to healthy controls. Further, HHcy and low levels of folate and vitamin 
      B(12) were more frequent in patients with UC. The MTR 2756G allele, extent of the
      disease, and gender were the independent determinants of HHcy in these patients. 
      These findings suggest that genetic and nutritional factors have a synergetic
      effect on HHcy in patients with UC. In conclusion, our data highlight a
      prevention strategy for moderation of HHcy and supplementation with folate and
      vitamine B(12) in patients with UC from Southeast China.

TI  - Nutritional problems in inflammatory bowel disease: the patient perspective.
PG  - 443-50
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.04.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that
      impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective
      reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease
      process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored
      nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied.
      This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important
      to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services
      provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited
      to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews.
      The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have
      experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they
      had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients
      completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and 
      nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of
      IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and
      UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%)
      CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than
      half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address 
      these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD
      patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with 
      CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling,
      highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal
      provision of services for both groups.

      systematic evaluation in pediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 423-9
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.05.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has not been an extensive comparison of CRP and ESR in
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and thus, we aimed to explore their utility in UC.
      METHODS: Four previously enrolled cohorts of 451 children with UC were utilized, 
      all including laboratory, clinical and endoscopic data. A longitudinal analysis
      was performed on prospectively collected data of 75 children. Disease activity
      was captured by both global assessment and pediatric UC activity index (PUCAI).
      RESULTS: The best thresholds to differentiate quiescent, mild, moderate and
      severe disease activity, were <23, 23-29, 30-37, >37 mm/h for ESR, and <2.5,
      2.5-5, 5.01-9, >9 mg/L for CRP (area under the ROC curves 0.70-0.81). Correlation
      of endoscopic appearance with CRP and ESR were 0.55 and 0.41, respectively
      (P<0.001). Both CRP and ESR may be completely normal in 34% and 5-10% of those
      with mild and moderate-severe disease activity, respectively. Elevated CRP in the
      presence of normal ESR or vice versa was noted in 32%, 38%, 30% and 17% of those 
      with quiescent, mild, moderate and severe disease activity. Over time, the
      utility of CRP and ESR in reflecting disease activity remained stable in 70-80%
      of cases. CONCLUSION: In ~2/3 of children, both CRP and ESR values reflect
      disease activity to a similar degree and in the remaining, either CRP or ESR may 
      be sufficient, with slight superiority of CRP. CRP is more closely correlated
      with endoscopic appearance. When either CRP or ESR performs well for a given
      patient, this is likely to remain so over time. Therefore, it may not be
      justified to routinely test both ESR and CRP in monitoring disease activity.

LID - 10.1016/j.cppeds.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of
      overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific
      dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be
      given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
      For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however,
      enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as
      corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses,
      advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is
      warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as
      polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as
      transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons,
      nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are
      most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth,
      pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new
      field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific
      diet to the patient genotype.

TI  - Clostridium difficile infection in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence and risk factors.
PG  - 844-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21837 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and microbiological data suggest that Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) plays a substantial role in the clinical initiation of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study was to investigate
      the prevalence and risk factors of CDI in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with
      IBD. METHODS: The current investigation was a retrospective study. All patients
      newly diagnosed with IBD in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic in Warsaw
      between 2007 and 2010 were included in the present study. The patients were
      diagnosed according to Porto criteria and microbiology evaluation screening tests
      for CDI were conducted. Risk factors including prior hospitalization, use of
      antibiotics within 2 months of CDI detection, colonic involvement, and the
      duration of symptoms were evaluated. CDI diagnosis was based on a positive stool 
      enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In the present study, 134 patients were evaluated
      (54 patients with Crohn's disease, and 80 with ulcerative colitis; 87% of the
      patients had colonic disease). The average age of the patients was 12.3 years,
      and the prevalence of CDI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-56%).
      Significant differences in the prevalence of CDI between patients with Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.72; odds ratio [OR] = 1.187, 95% CI,
      0.56-2.52) were not observed. The risk of CDI was associated with an increase in 
      the age of the patient and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The
      prevalence of CDI in newly diagnosed IBD patients was high and was independent of
      the type of disease.

TI  - Evaluating the use of metabolite measurement in children receiving treatment with
      a thiopurine.
PG  - 1106-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04848.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical response to thiopurine medication is related to the
      concentration of its metabolites. Proxy measures are traditionally used to assess
      dose adequacy. We present our experience of using tioguanine (previously
      known/formerly referred to as thioguanine) metabolite measurements in paediatric 
      patients and evaluate their effect on clinical practice. AIMS: To report our
      experience of using tioguanine metabolite measurements in paediatric patients and
      to evaluate their effects on clinical practice. METHODS: The 6-tioguanine
      nucleotide (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) were measured in children
      prescribed thiopurine medication for at least 3 months. Data were collected on
      thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) genotype, drug dose, laboratory indices and 
      management changes. Therapeutic 6-TGN levels were defined as 235-400 pmol/8 x
      10(8) RBCs. Seventy individuals (30 males) with a median age of 15 years.
      Underlying diagnoses were 'IBD' (68/70) and two cases of eosinophilic colitis.
      Sixty-three were treated with azathioprine and seven with mercaptopurine. A total
      of 103 separate measurements were made. RESULTS: On initial measurement, 68% of
      patients had 6-TGN levels outside therapeutic levels despite standard thiopurine 
      dosing. Initial 6-TGN levels were significantly higher in patients with TPMT
      mutations. Toxicity occurred in seven cases. The 6-TGN levels were significantly 
      higher in those with signs of marrow toxicity. The 6-TGN level correlated with
      WBC, leukocyte count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and DeltaMCV; however, the
      ability of each of these to predict therapeutic 6-TGN levels was poor. After
      initial measurement, management was changed in 25/70 cases (36%). CONCLUSIONS:
      6-TGN levels were therapeutic in a minority of those patients who were tested.
      Proxy measures perform poorly in predicting therapeutic 6-TGN levels. Measuring
      thiopurine metabolites is useful for dosage adjustment in children, and for the
      detection of potential toxicity.

TI  - Genetic variations in matrix metalloproteinases may be associated with increased 
      risk of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1117-27
LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2011.08.011 [doi]
AB  - Increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays an important role 
      in tissue damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Genetically encoded
      variation between individuals in MMP production may therefore contribute to
      disease onset, type, or severity. We undertook an extensive candidate gene single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) study of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12, -13, 
      and -14 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)-1, -3, and -4 in
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We identified tagging SNPs across these genes, and
      genotyped these SNPs in a Caucasian New Zealand dataset consisting of 419 UC
      patients and 907 controls. SNPs in a number of MMP genes were associated with UC.
      After correcting for multiple testing SNPs in MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-10, and MMP-14
      remained significant in their associations with UC. In a second study, using
      samples from a Dutch cohort, most of the significant findings in the New Zealand 
      cohort were not replicated. However, data from an international meta-analysis
      provide some support for the initial findings. In conclusion, this study provides
      preliminary evidence to suggest that genetic variation in the MMPs may play a
      role in interindividual differences in UC susceptibility and clinical outcome.
      Further studies are needed in other cohorts to determine the robustness of these 
      observations in different populations.

TI  - Cardiac involvement in inflammatory bowel disease: role of acylcarnitine esters.
PG  - e105-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular complications have been frequently described in
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Both Crohn disease and Ulcerative Colitis are
      characterized by malabsorption of some micronutrients, such as carnitine, which
      is a very important element for myocardial metabolism, being demonstrated that
      its deficiency correlates with heart involvement in coeliac disease. Aims of this
      study are to evaluate cardiac function in IBD patients asymptomatic for
      cardiovascular diseases and to correlate the cardiac data with the profile of
      carnitine esters plasma levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out 
      on 20 IBD patients by comparison with 18 sex- and age-matched clinically healthy 
      controls. Personal and familial history, physical examination, standard
      electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed in all subjects. Complete
      panel of nutritional status parameters and serum levels of free carnitine and its
      esters were evaluated both in IBD patients and control subjects. RESULTS:
      Isovaleryl-carnitine, Tiglyl-carnitine, Octenoylcarnitine and Decanoyl-carnitine,
      were found to be significantly lower in IBD patients. Significant correlations
      were found between some carnitine esters and echocardiographic parameters
      although total and free carnitine were meanly more elevated in IBD. No
      statistically significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were found 
      between IBD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of some
      isoforms of carnitine, especially those esterified with short chain fatty acids, 
      may play an important role in cardiac involvement in course of IBD and could
      lead, over time, to dilated cardiomiopathy.

TI  - NADPH oxidase complex and IBD candidate gene studies: identification of a rare
      variant in NCF2 that results in reduced binding to RAC2.
PG  - 1028-35
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex produces reactive oxygen species and
      plays a critical role in the killing of microbes by phagocytes. Genetic mutations
      in genes encoding components of the complex result in both X-linked and autosomal
      recessive forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Patients with CGD often
      develop intestinal inflammation that is histologically similar to Crohn's
      colitis, suggesting a common aetiology for both diseases. The aim of this study
      is to determine if polymorphisms in NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex genes that do not 
      cause CGD are associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). METHODS: Direct sequencing and candidate gene approaches were used to
      identify susceptibility loci in NADPH oxidase complex genes. Functional studies
      were carried out on identified variants. Novel findings were replicated in
      independent cohorts. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified a novel missense
      variant in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2) gene that is associated with 
      very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) and subsequently found in 4% of patients with
      VEO-IBD compared with 0.2% of controls (p=1.3x10(-5), OR 23.8 (95% CI 3.9 to
      142.5); Fisher exact test). This variant reduced binding of the NCF2 gene product
      p67(phox) to RAC2. This study found a novel genetic association of RAC2 with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and replicated the previously reported association of NCF4
      with ileal CD. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the rare novel p67(phox)
      variant results in partial inhibition of oxidase function and are associated with
      CD in a subgroup of patients with VEO-IBD; and suggest that components of the
      NADPH oxidase complex are associated with CD.

TI  - Intestinal steroid profiles and microbiota composition in colitic mice.
PG  - 159-66
LID - 10.4161/gmic.2.3.16104 [doi]
AB  - Reduced gut microbiota diversity in conjunction with a bloom of few bacterial
      species is a common feature in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
      However, the environmental changes caused by inflammation and their possible
      impact on the microbiota are largely unknown. Since IBD is associated with an
      impaired intestinal steroid metabolism, we hypothesized that changes in
      intestinal steroid and particularly bile acid (BA) concentrations affect
      microbial communities. We used Interleukin-10 deficient (IL-10-/-) mice as a
      model for chronic gut inflammation. Healthy wild-type mice served as controls. In
      these animals, intestinal steroid concentrations and gut microbial diversity were
      analyzed at 24 weeks of age. The IL 10-/- mice developed moderate inflammation in
      cecum and colon and colorectal tumor formation was observed in 55 % of the
      animals. Compared to the healthy conditions, gut inflammation was associated with
      higher intestinal cholesterol and cholic acid concentrations and a reduced
      microbial diversity. The latter was accompanied by a proliferation of
      Robinsoniella peoriensis, Clostridium innocuum, Escherichia coli, and
      Enterococcus gallinarum. All these species proved to be highly bile acid
      resistant. We concluded that chronic colitis in IL-10-/- mice is associated with 
      changes in intestinal steroid profiles. These changes may be due to alterations
      in gut microbiota composition or vice versa. Whether the bacterial sterol and
      bile acid metabolism is implicated in colitis and colorectal carcinoma etiology
      remains to be clarified.

TI  - Interactions with M cells and macrophages as key steps in the pathogenesis of
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections.
PG  - e23594
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0023594 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are food-borne pathogens that can cause
      serious infections ranging from diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Translocation of Shiga-toxins (Stx) from the gut
      lumen to underlying tissues is a decisive step in the development of the
      infection, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Many bacterial pathogens
      target the follicle-associated epithelium, which overlies Peyer's patches (PPs), 
      cross the intestinal barrier through M cells and are captured by mucosal
      macrophages. Here, translocation across M cells, as well as survival and
      proliferation of EHEC strains within THP-1 macrophages were investigated using
      EHEC O157:H7 reference strains, isogenic mutants, and 15 EHEC strains isolated
      from HC/HUS patients. We showed for the first time that E. coli O157:H7 strains
      are able to interact in vivo with murine PPs, to translocate ex vivo through
      murine ileal mucosa with PPs and across an in vitro human M cell model. EHEC
      strains are also able to survive and to produce Stx in macrophages, which induce 
      cell apoptosis and Stx release. In conclusion, our results suggest that the
      uptake of EHEC by M cells and underlying macrophages in the PP may be a critical 
      step in Stx translocation and release in vivo. A new model for EHEC infection in 
      humans is proposed that could help in a fuller understanding of EHEC-associated
      diseases.

TI  - Diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease in
      Europe: results of a 5-year audit of the EUROKIDS registry.
PG  - 374-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318231d984 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2005, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working Group of the
      European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition
      published consensus guidelines on the diagnostic workup of paediatric IBD, the
      Porto criteria. According to these guidelines, children suspected of having IBD
      should undergo an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), ileocolonoscopy, and (except
      in cases of definitive ulcerative colitis) adequate imaging of the small bowel.
      To audit and evaluate the diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with IBD in
      Europe, the Working Group created EUROKIDS, a prospective, Web-based registry of 
      newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: Patients with IBD (ages
      0-18 years) were registered in 44 centres in 18 countries. Data on diagnostic
      workup were analysed according to the year of diagnosis, type of IBD, and centre 
      size. Diagnostic yield of OGD and ileal intubation were evaluated. RESULTS:
      Between 2004 and 2009, 2087 newly diagnosed patients were correctly registered.
      Both OGD and ileocolonoscopy had been performed in 64% of all of the patients and
      increased significantly from year 1 (52 %) to 5 (71%, P < 0.001). Small-bowel
      follow-through use decreased during the years (year 1 n = 213, year 5 n = 108; P 
      < 0.001), whereas magnetic resonance imaging use increased (year 1 n = 25, year 5
      n = 171; P < 0.001). Patients diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD, 59%) and
      ulcerative colitis (58%) were more likely to have had a complete diagnostic
      workup than patients diagnosed as having IBD unclassified (45%). In CD, the
      diagnostic yield of OGD was 7.5% and the yield of ileal intubation was 13%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The quality of diagnostic workup in paediatric patients with IBD
      increased steadily between 2004 and 2009. Small-bowel imaging by magnetic
      resonance imaging superseded the use of small-bowel follow-through. OGD and ileal
      intubation contributed to a definitive diagnosis of CD.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 571-80

AB  - The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively
      unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent
      and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First
      principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut
      whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with 
      short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors 
      the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of
      active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are
      accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple
      polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient
      evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the
      maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN
      reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in
      support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute
      flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the
      evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better 
      those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.

AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics provide therapeutic benefits in
      inflammatory bowel disease. In vitro evidence suggested that Lactobacillus
      paracasei also called ST11 (CNCM I-2116) is a potent strain with immune
      modulation properties. However, little is known about its capacity to alleviate
      inflammatory symptoms in vivo In this context, the main objective of this study
      was to investigate the role of ST11 on intestinal inflammation using the adoptive
      transfer mouse model of experimental colitis. Rag2(-/-) recipient mice were fed
      with ST11 (10(9) CFU/day)a month prior toinduce colitis by adoptive transfer of
      naive T cells. One month later, in clear contrast to nonfed mice, weight loss was
      significantly reduced by 50% in ST11-fed mice. Further analysis of colon
      specimens revealed a significant reduction neutrophil infiltration and mucosal
      expression of IL1beta, IL-6, and IL12 proinflammatory cytokines, whereas no
      consistent differences in expression of antibacterial peptides or tight junction 
      proteins were observed between PBS and ST11-fed mice. All together, our results
      demonstrate that oral administration of ST11 was safe and had a significant
      preventive effect on colitis. We conclude that probiotics such as Lactobacillus
      paracasei harbor worthwhile in vivo immunomodulatory properties to prevent
      intestinal inflammation by nutritional approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin has detrimental effects on the gastrointestinal tract mucosa 
      and may play a role in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To
      investigate if the regular use of aspirin is associated with the development of
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using, for the first time, a
      prospective cohort study design. METHODS: A total of 135,780 men and women in
      Europe, aged 30-74years, were recruited into the European Prospective
      Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Participants completed
      questionnaires at baseline detailing their regular aspirin use and were then
      followed up to identify those who developed either incident CD or UC. Each case
      was matched with four controls and odds ratios (OR) were calculated, adjusting
      for cigarette smoking. Potential interactions between aspirin and smoking were
      assessed. RESULTS: A total of 35 participants developed CD and a further 84 were 
      diagnosed with UC. Regular aspirin intake was positively associated with the risk
      of developing CD (OR=6.14, 95% CI=1.76-21.35). In those who took aspirin and
      smoked there was no detectable increased risk of CD (OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-3.08). 
      No association was found between regular aspirin use and UC (OR=1.29, 95%
      CI=0.67-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: A strong positive association between regular aspirin
      use and CD, but not UC, was observed. The data suggest that regular aspirin use
      should be measured in epidemiological work on CD. If such findings are consistent
      in other work then aspirin may affect the development of CD in a middle-aged to
      elderly population.

AB  - The treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease have expanded with the
      introduction of biological therapies. Recently published controlled clinical
      trials were searched and those that impact the clinical management of ulcerative 
      colitis (UC) are discussed in this review. In the management of mild to moderate 
      UC, mesalamine still remains the first choice of drug. The newly developed once
      daily formulations have shown equal efficacy to divided doses and possibly
      portend better compliance owing to a simplified regimen. In outpatients with
      moderate to severe UC, recent data indicate that infliximab induced and
      maintained remission leads to decreased colectomy rates and fewer
      hospitalizations. An alternative anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent,
      adalimumab, was also recently shown to be effective for induction of remission in
      moderate to severe UC. The use of immunosuppressives, such as azathioprine and
      mercaptopurine, is associated with decreased colectomy rates and thioguanine was 
      shown to be effective in maintaining clinical remission in those who are
      intolerant to azathioprine/mercaptopurine. In hospitalized patients with steroid 
      resistant severe UC, infliximab and tacrolimus may be alternatives to
      cyclosporine in those who are otherwise candidates for colectomy. Adequate
      long-term maintenance therapy with immunosuppressives or anti-TNF therapy is
      required after rescue therapy for a sustained benefit. Future research is needed 
      to position the available anti-TNF agents and combined immunosuppressive therapy 
      in the treatment of UC to achieve and maintain steroid free remission.

      IBD.
PG  - 150-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182144c74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of
      treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however,
      its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study
      was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and
      adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents 
      with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 
      healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at 
      the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in
      controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the
      baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P
      < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05).
      During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased
      in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease
      remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD
      during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1
      concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group
      (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving
      remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor
      production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which
      possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: Is there a shift towards onset at a
      younger age?
PG  - 141-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318218be35 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are reported. To determine whether this 
      observation is a consequence of a shift towards onset at a younger age, we
      analysed retrospective data from patients enrolled in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study 
      (SIBDCS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SIBDCS is a disease-based cohort in
      Switzerland, which collects retrospective and prospective data on a large sample 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients, diagnosed from 1980,
      were stratified according to diagnosis of CD and UC. Age at disease onset (age at
      first symptoms and age at diagnosis) was analysed in relation to calendar year of
      disease onset. Data were extracted from physician and patient questionnaires.
      Linear regressions of age at disease onset by calendar year of disease onset
      adjusted by sex, country of birth, and education were performed. RESULTS:
      Adjusted regression coefficients for CD and UC were significantly positive, that 
      is, age at disease onset has increased with time. Male sex was associated with an
      increase in age at disease onset, and birth in Switzerland with a decrease. These
      associations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the
      SIBDCS do not support the hypothesis that disease onset of both CD and UC occur
      today at a younger age. On the contrary, our results show that there is a
      significant trend for age at disease onset occurring at an older age today as
      compared with recent decades. We conclude that the observation of increasing
      numbers of paediatric and adolescent patients with IBD is not caused by a trend
      towards disease onset at a younger age, but that this may rather be a consequence
      of the overall increasing incidence of these conditions.

TI  - Fecal osteoprotegerin may guide the introduction of second-line therapy in
      hospitalized children with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1726-30
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21561 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is increased in inflamed colonic mucosa and has
      a role in immune regulation and apoptosis resistance. Fecal OPG may be useful in 
      predicting corticosteroid resistance in hospitalized children with severe
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to determine whether fecal OPG predicts the
      need for second-line therapies in children hospitalized for UC. METHODS: We
      included 83 children with UC admitted for intravenous corticosteroid treatment.
      Children were classified as responders/nonresponders based on the need for
      therapy escalation. Fecal OPG results were compared with those of four other
      fecal markers. RESULTS: Of the enrolled children, seven had day 1 samples only,
      53 children had day 3 samples only, and 23 had both. Twenty-two children failed
      corticosteroid therapy and required infliximab (n = 20) or colectomy (n = 2). On 
      the third treatment day the median fecal OPG levels were significantly higher in 
      the nonresponders group compared with the responders: 77 pmol/L (interquartile
      range [IQR] 27-137) versus 13 pmol/L (3-109); P = 0.007. The best day 3 fecal OPG
      cutoff to predict second-line therapy was >50 pmol/L with a sensitivity of 71%
      and specificity of 69% (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] of 0.70%-95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.82). Fecal OPG was superior to day 3 fecal
      calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 as a predictor of corticosteroid
      nonresponse, but equivalent to the less commonly used M2-pyruvate kinase.
      CONCLUSIONS: Day 3 fecal OPG may guide the decision to institute second-line
      therapy in children with severe UC. The role of OPG in the inflammatory response 
      in pediatric UC deserves further study.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial
      community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This
      endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host
      and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and
      non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen
      exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host,
      various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial 
      composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further
      impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have
      been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition,
      extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also
      associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is
      an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating
      its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and
      maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship
      between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present
      evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease
      development.

      disease.
PG  - 1275-8
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2011.594087 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Europe has
      increased significantly. At least a fourth of patients are children.
      Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is believed to be an important component of innate
      immunity, acting as an opsonin and activator of the lectin pathway (LP) of
      complement. The data relating any of the LP factors to IBD are sparse and
      contradictory and were obtained mainly from adult patients. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the possible role of MBL in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in children. METHODS: MBL2 gene single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) and MBL concentrations (ELISA) were determined. RESULTS:
      The frequency of MBL2 gene variants responsible for MBL deficiency (LXPA/O and
      O/O) is significantly higher in CD patients compared with controls or children
      with UC. A relatively high frequency of the codon 52 mutation (D allele) was
      noted in these patients. Practically no difference was found between UC and
      control (C) groups. Similarly, the average MBL levels as well as the number of
      MBL-deficient (MBL concentrations < 150 ng/ml) individuals differed between CD
      patients and controls or children suffering from UC. Again, there was no
      difference between UC and C groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBL
      deficiency may be associated with CD but not with UC in pediatric patients. The
      possible role of MBL in IBD requires confirmation in larger series and further
      investigation of the mechanisms involved.

TI  - [When to think about Crohn's disease when facing with chronic abdominal pain in
      children and adolescents?].
PG  - 643-7
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) together with ulcerative colitis (UC) and indeterminate
      colitis (IC) are the so called inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Epidemiological
      data show an increased incidence of both UC and CD and, especially in North
      America and in Europe, an increased prevalence of CD. European data show that
      northern countries present higher rates of IBD than southern ones. It is
      estimated that 15%-20% of CD patients experience onset of their symptoms under 20
      years of age. An increasing number of children enter disease before 8 years of
      age. The pathogenesis of CD has became more documented involving both the immune 
      system and changes in intestinal microbiota. Chronic abdominal pain associated
      with failure to thrive and inflammatory syndrome with or without intestinal
      transit disorders suggest CD. Onset of a anoperineal disease is also suggestive
      of CD and is a severity sign. The diagnosis is based on clinical history,
      physical examination, radiological studies, endoscopy, and histology. CD is
      defined by evidence of a discontinuous chronic inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract with or without granulomas and supported by clinical,
      biochemical, and radiological evidence. Treatment aims to reducing inflammation
      and restauring growth. Enteral feeding has become a key issue in allowing to
      avoid steroids. Immunosuppressive treatment based on azathioprine is increasingly
      used for maintaining remission. Anti-TNF treatment is a rescue therapy in case of
      refractory, frequently relapsing disease especially those with ano-perineal
      disease.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunct VSL#3 therapy versus standard medical
      therapy in pediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 489-96
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182293a5e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are costly chronic
      gastrointestinal diseases, with pediatric IBD representing increased costs per
      patient compared to adult disease. Health care expenditures for ulcerative
      colitis (UC) are >$2 billion annually. It is not clear whether the addition of
      VSL#3 to standard medical therapy in UC induction and maintenance of remission is
      a cost-effective strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review
      of the literature and created a Markov model simulating a cohort of 10-year-old
      patients with severe UC, studying them until 100 years of age or death. We
      compared 2 strategies: standard medical therapy versus medical therapy + VSL#3.
      For both strategies, we assumed that patients progressed through escalating
      therapies--mesalamine, azathioprine, and infliximab--before receiving a colectomy
      + ileal pouch anal anastamosis (IPAA) if the 3 medical therapy options were
      exhausted. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness
      ratio (ICER), defined as the difference of costs between strategies for each
      quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way sensitivity analyses were
      performed on variables to determine the key variables affecting
      cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Standard medical care accrued a lifetime cost of
      $203,317 per patient, compared to $212,582 per patient for medical therapy +
      VSL#3. Lifetime QALYs gained was comparable for standard medical therapy and
      medical therapy + VSL#3 at 24.93 versus 25.05, respectively. Using the definition
      of ICER <50,000/QALY as a cost-effective intervention, medical therapy + VSL#3
      produced an ICER of $79,910 per QALY gained, making this strategy
      cost-ineffective. Sensitivity analyses showed that 4 key parameters could affect 
      the cost-effectiveness of the 2 strategies: cost of colectomy + IPAA, maintenance
      cost after surgery, probability of developing pouchitis after surgery, and the
      quality of life after a colectomy + IPAA. High surgical and postsurgical costs, a
      high probability of developing pouchitis, and a low quality of life after a
      colectomy + IPAA could make adjunct VSL#3 use a cost-effective strategy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Given present data, adjunct VSL#3 use for pediatric UC induction and
      maintenance of remission is not cost-effective, although several key parameters
      could make this strategy cost-effective. The quality of life after an IPAA is the
      single most important variable predicting whether this procedure benefits
      patients over escalating standard medical therapy.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms that increase expression of the guanosine
      triphosphatase RAC1 are associated with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 633-41
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.04.057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: RAC1 is a guanosine triphosphatase that has an evolutionarily 
      conserved role in coordinating immune defenses, from plants to mammals. Chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with dysregulation of immune defenses.
      We studied the role of RAC1 in inflammatory bowel diseases using human genetic
      and functional studies and animal models of colitis. METHODS: We used a candidate
      gene approach to HapMap-Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery
      cohort; findings were confirmed in 2 additional cohorts. RAC1 messenger RNA
      expression was examined from peripheral blood cells of patients. Colitis was
      induced in mice with conditional disruption of Rac1 in phagocytes by
      administration of dextran sulfate sodium. RESULTS: We observed a genetic
      association between RAC1 with ulcerative colitis in a discovery cohort, 2
      independent replication cohorts, and in combined analysis for the single
      nucleotide polymorphisms rs10951982 (P(combined UC) = 3.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 
      1.43 [95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.63]) and rs4720672 (P(combined UC) = 4.7 x 
      10(-6), odds ratio = 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.58]). Patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease who had the rs10951982 risk allele had increased
      expression of RAC1 compared to those without this allele. Conditional disruption 
      of Rac1 in macrophage and neutrophils of mice protected against dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Human studies and knockout mice demonstrated
      a role for the guanosine triphosphatase RAC1 in the development of ulcerative
      colitis; increased expression of RAC1 was associated with susceptibility to
      colitis.

AB  - We present here two siblings with a history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers,
      neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations. The diagnosis of Behcet's
      disease in a context of familial aggregation was assumed. Facing repeated
      steroid-dependent flares and failure of maintenance therapies with colchicine and
      intolerance to pentoxifilline and disulone, adalimumab was started. Rapid
      response was observed in both patients, with clinical remission after induction
      therapy, which currently sustains under maintenance schedule. This case report
      suggests the effectiveness of adalimumab as first anti-TNFalpha in case of
      steroid-dependent/resistant gastrointestinal BD.

TI  - Air pollution: An environmental factor contributing to intestinal disease.
PG  - 279-86
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.02.017 [doi]
AB  - The health impacts of air pollution have received much attention and have
      recently been subject to extensive study. Exposure to air pollutants such as
      particulate matter (PM) has been linked to lung and cardiovascular disease and
      increases in both hospital admissions and mortality. However, little attention
      has been given to the effects of air pollution on the intestine. The recent
      discovery of genes linked to susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) 
      explains only a fraction of the hereditary variance for these diseases. This,
      together with evidence of increases in incidence of IBD in the past few decades
      of enhanced industrialization, suggests that environmental factors could
      contribute to disease pathogenesis. Despite this, little research has examined
      the potential contribution of air pollution and its components to intestinal
      disease. Exposure of the bowel to air pollutants occurs via mucociliary clearance
      of PM from the lungs as well as ingestion via food and water sources. Gaseous
      pollutants may also induce systemic effects. Plausible mechanisms mediating the
      effects of air pollutants on the bowel could include direct effects on epithelial
      cells, systemic inflammation and immune activation, and modulation of the
      intestinal microbiota. Although there is limited epidemiologic evidence to
      confirm this, we suggest that a link between air pollution and intestinal disease
      exists and warrants further study. This link may explain, at least in part, how
      environmental factors impact on IBD epidemiology and disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often question their doctors about
      diet. The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing
      dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical
      societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD;
      listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and
      creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the
      existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from
      sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding 
      foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals,
      drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral
      supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat,
      reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice 
      exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease
      patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effect of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids in intestinal microvascular endothelium.
PG  - 678-87
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2011.05.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of endothelial cells in inflammatory bowel disease
      has been recently emphasized. Endothelial activation and expression of adhesion
      molecules are critical for leukocytes recruitment into the inflammatory wall.
      Compelling evidence demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of long chain n-3 PUFA
      in inflammatory models. We previously showed that long chain n-3 PUFA (EPA and
      DHA) inhibited inflammatory response in epithelial and dendritic cells. As long
      chain n-3 PUFA treatment led to a decreased expression of adhesion molecules in
      endothelial cells from other organs, we have now investigated their effect on
      intestinal endothelial cells in vitro and in colitic rats. METHODS: In vitro
      study: Primary culture of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells
      (HIMEC) were pre-treated with DHA and then incubated with IL-1beta. In vivo
      study: Colitis was induced in 2 groups at day0 by intrarectal injection of
      2-4-6-trinitrobenzen sulfonic acid (TNBS). Rats received by gavage either fish
      oil, rich in EPA and DHA (TNBS+n-3) or an isocaloric isolipidic oil formula for
      14 days. RESULTS: DHA led to a decreased VCAM-1, TLR4, cyclooxygenase-2 and
      VEGFR2 expression and a decreased production of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF and a
      reduced production of PGE(2) and LTB(4) (p < 0.001) in IL-1beta-induced HIMEC.
      Similarly, dietary intervention with fish oil rich in EPA and DHA significantly
      decreased colon production of PGE(2) and LTB(4,) endothelial VCAM-1 and VEGFR2 in
      rats with colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies
      reveal a potential anti-angiogenic role of long chain n-3 PUFA in intestinal
      endothelial cells. This protective effect of long chain n-3 PUFA may partly
      explain the observed benefit of dietary intake of long chain n-3 PUFA in IBD
      development.

AB  - Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure
      in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone
      disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular
      (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic
      (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of
      autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive
      tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are 
      microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free
      diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial
      lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic
      lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient 
      in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and 
      correct the over-mortality related to these complications.

TI  - Fecal bacteriotherapy for ulcerative colitis: patients are ready, are we?
PG  - 676-84
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal bacteriotherapy (FB) has been proposed as a safe and effective 
      alternative treatment for a number of gastrointestinal conditions including
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a qualitative study to explore the
      attitudes and concerns of adult patients and parents of children with UC
      regarding FB as a potential treatment. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups for
      adult patients with UC and parents of children with UC or indeterminate colitis. 
      Participants were asked about their perceptions of and interest in FB as a
      treatment for UC. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed to identify
      domains, themes, and major concepts. RESULTS: The focus groups included 15 adult 
      patients and seven parents of children with colitis. We identified five major
      domains pertaining to FB: impressions of treatment, benefits, risks, potential
      mechanisms, and social concerns. All but one participant expressed interest in FB
      and several wished it were already available. Participants compared FB to
      probiotics, felt it was "natural," easier than current therapies, and with donor 
      screening would be safe. Although initial distaste and the "yuck factor" were
      uniformly mentioned, these concerns were outweighed by perceived benefits.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine important ethical and social
      issues surrounding FB as a treatment for UC. Given adequate supporting research, 
      donor selection, and screening, adult patients and parents of children with UC
      will consider FB and are eager for it to become available. These findings have
      important implications for future microbiome-based treatments.

      disease: a one-year prospective follow-up study.
PG  - 718-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to longitudinally study serum homocysteine 
      levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in
      relation to disease activity and B vitamin status. METHODS: In all, 98
      consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28)
      were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were
      no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary
      intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once
      during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels
      during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to
      elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently
      in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin 
      B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a
      significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001,
      B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse 
      relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r =
      -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients
      with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between
      disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have
      vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated
      homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.

AB  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis commonly affect women in their childbearing 
      years. Fortunately, advances in the field of inflammatory bowel disease have made
      successful pregnancy outcomes a reality for many women. These advances have led
      to family planning as a common discussion between gastroenterologists and
      inflammatory bowel disease patients. Common discussion topics are fertility,
      conception, medication safety, pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding although
      there are limited available data. Education and patient awareness have become
      vital factors in successful pregnancy outcomes.

      Activity Index scores.
PG  - 708-13
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182099018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Currently validated ulcerative colitis (UC) activity measures are
      physician based, but incorporate patient reports of symptoms. We aimed to assess 
      whether patient-completed Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) scores are
      comparable to those of physician scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a
      single-center prospective study to assess agreement between patient- and
      physician-completed PUCAI scores. Seventy patients with UC (ages 4-29)
      representative of all of the disease activity categories (inactive, mild,
      moderate, and severe) in the currently published physician-completed scoring
      system were recruited. Agreement was analyzed for PUCAI scores both as continuous
      and categorical measures. To ascertain validity, we compared both patient- and
      physician-completed PUCAI scores with the physician global assessment and serum
      inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Patient- and physician-completed PUCAI summary
      scores were identical 49% of the time, were different but within the minimal
      clinically important difference (MCID) of 20 points 48% of the time, and were at 
      or beyond the MCID only 3% of the time. In general, patients reported higher mean
      disease severity on their questionnaires than did their physicians, with a mean
      difference in PUCAI scores of 3 +/- 8 (95% confidence interval 2%-5%). A
      categorical comparison of the 2 sets of questionnaires using the disease activity
      groups demonstrated perfect agreement for 60 (86%) pairs (kappa coefficient 0.78;
      95% confidence interval 0.65%-0.90%). Both patient- and physician-completed PUCAI
      scores also correlated well with the physician global assessment and serum
      inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate strong agreement between
      PUCAI scores obtained directly from patients and those completed by physicians.
      Hence, a patient-based PUCAI could complement existing instruments in both
      clinical and research settings.

TI  - Combined azithromycin and metronidazole therapy is effective in inducing
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 222-6
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.01.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an aberrant response to the 
      gut microbiota. We aimed to assess whether azithromycin based therapy is
      effective in inducing remission in CD, due to its effect in inducing apoptosis
      and efficacy against biofilms and intracellular bacteria. METHODS: Retrospective 
      analysis of patients treated with an 8 week course of combined azithromycin and
      metronidazole. Patients were included if they had active CD defined as pediatric 
      CD activity index (PCDAI) >/= 10, and were not receiving any other medication for
      inducing remission in active disease. PCDAI score and CRP were recorded at
      baseline and 8 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: Thirty two patients (mean age 13.1 +/- 
      3.9, mean duration of disease 0.65 years) were included, of whom 21 (66%) entered
      clinical remission (PCDAI<10) after 8 weeks of treatment. The mean age at
      treatment and duration of disease did not differ between patients entering
      remission and those unresponsive to therapy. CRP, normalized in 54% of patients
      with elevated CRP at baseline. Factors associated with lack of response were a
      more severe disease (reflected by higher PCDAI and CRP values at baseline),
      presence of arthritis and extensive disease (ileocolonic, or prominent upper
      intestinal disease). CONCLUSIONS: An 8 week course of azithromycin and
      metronidazole therapy may be effective in inducing clinical remission in
      mild-moderate luminal CD in children and young adults.

TI  - Intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatants from ulcerative colitis patients
      triggers altered permeability and inflammation in mice: role of cathepsin G and
      protease-activated receptor-4.
PG  - 1409-14
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cathepsin G (Cat-G) is a neutrophil serine-protease found in the
      colonic lumen of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Cat-G is able to activate
      protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR(4) ) located at the apical side of
      enterocytes, leading to epithelial barrier disruption. However, the mechanisms
      through which Cat-G triggers inflammation are not fully elucidated. The aims of
      our study were to evaluate in vivo the effects of UC fecal supernatants and Cat-G
      on epithelial barrier function and inflammation, and the connection between these
      two parameters. METHODS: Male balb/c mice were used in this study. We evaluated
      the effect of a 2-hour intracolonic infusion of 1) fecal supernatants from UC
      patients pretreated or not with specific Cat-G inhibitor (SCGI); 2) PAR(4)
      -activating peptide (PAR(4) -AP); and 3) Cat-G on colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and paracellular permeability (CPP). The involvement of PAR(4) was
      assessed by pretreating animals with pepducin P4pal-10, which blocks PAR(4)
      signaling. We investigated the role of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase by using
      its inhibitor, ML-7, and we determined phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) levels in mice
      colonic mucosa. RESULTS: UC fecal supernatants, Cat-G, and PAR(4) agonist
      increased both CPP and MPO activity in comparison with healthy subjects fecal
      supernatants. ML-7 inhibited the CPP increase triggered by Cat-G by 92.3%, and
      the enhanced MPO activity by 43.8%. Intracolonic infusion of UC fecal supernatant
      determined an increased phosphorylation level of MLC. CONCLUSIONS: These
      observations support that luminal factors such as Cat-G play an important
      proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of colitis, mainly depending on CPP
      increase by MLC phosphorylation.

TI  - miR-143 and miR-145 are downregulated in ulcerative colitis: putative regulators 
      of inflammation and protooncogenes.
PG  - 94-100
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: miR-143 and miR-145 are believed to function as colon cancer tumor
      suppressors, as they inhibit colon cancer cell growth and are downregulated in
      sporadic colonic tumors. We speculated that miR-143 and miR-145 might also be
      downregulated and contribute to malignant transformation of colonic epithelium in
      longstanding ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Biopsies were obtained 20 cm
      proximal to the anus from individuals with quiescent UC and from normal controls.
      RNA and proteins were extracted and measured. miR-143 and miR-145 were quantified
      by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and miR-145 was also assessed by in 
      situ hybridization. Putative targets of these miRNAs, K-RAS, API5, MEK-2
      (miR-143), and IRS-1 (miR-145) were determined by western blotting. To assess the
      effects of miR-143 and miR-145 on these predicted targets, HCT116 and HCA-7
      colorectal cancer cells were transfected with miR-143 and miR-145 and expression 
      levels of these proteins were measured. RESULTS: In UC, miR-143 and miR-145 were 
      significantly downregulated 8.3-fold (3.4-20.1) (P < 0.0001) and 4.3-fold
      (2.3-7.8) (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared to normal colon. In contrast,
      IRS-1, K-RAS, API5, and MEK-2 were upregulated in UC, consistent with their
      assignments as targets of these miRNAs. Furthermore, transfected miR-143 and
      miR-145 significantly downregulated these proteins in HCT116 or HCA-7 cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared to normal colonic mucosa, in chronic UC miR-143 and miR-145
      were significantly downregulated and their predicted targets, IRS-1, K-RAS, API5,
      and MEK-2 were upregulated. We postulate that loss of these tumor suppressor
      miRNAs predispose to chronic inflammation and neoplastic progression in IBD.

TI  - [Application of the Porto criteria for the diagnosis of paediatric inflammatory
      bowel disease in a paediatric reference centre].

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have classically included two
      entities: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The correct
      differentiation between these two diseases has important implications. The term
      inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDu) describes inflammatory changes of 
      the colon that cannot be classified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
      This situation has been described in 20-30% of paediatric IBD at diagnosis. In
      order to reach a definitive diagnosis of suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease 
      in children, the ESPGHAN (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology and Nutrition) established the Porto criteria (PC) in July 2005. The
      recommendations include: 1) total colonoscopy with ileal intubation, 2) upper
      endoscopy, 3) multiple biopsies and 4) complete small bowel exploration. AIM: To 
      evaluate the diagnostic procedures used in our IBD patients regarding the PC.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the data of our IBD patients
      diagnosed in the last ten years (1999-2008) in a Spanish tertiary hospital,
      differentiating two periods: before and after the publication of the PC. RESULTS:
      A total of 108 IBD patients had been diagnosed (51 UC, 52 CD, 5 IBDu), 43 girls
      (39.81%), 65 boys (60.18%). According to the Montreal classification: 1) UC, 40
      (78%) extensive colitis, 5 left-sided colitis (9.8%), 6 proctitis (11%), 2) CD:
      44 ileo-colonic (84%), 13 ileal, 7 colonic. Median age at diagnosis: 13 years 1
      month (p25-p75: 10 years 3 months- 14 years 9months). The Porto criteria were
      followed in 49% of the cases (33.3% before its publication, 64.8% after, P=.001).
      Upper endoscopy was performed in 62 patients (58%): 38.9% versus 72.2%, P<.001.
      Upper involvement was found in 51% of our CD patients. Total colonoscopy with
      ileoscopy was achieved in 85.2% of the cases. The mean number of ileo-colonic
      segments biopsied was 6.6 (7 different segments). Granulomas at biopsies were
      present in 38% of our CD patients. Up to 38% of the CD patients had microscopic
      inflammation in endoscopically normal appearing segments. During the follow-up,
      initial diagnosis among the IBDu patients, was changed to CD in 1, to UC in 2 and
      the other 3 remained with the same diagnosis. We did not observe other changes in
      diagnosis in the remaining 103 patients (median follow-up: 4y 8mo). Thirty
      patients were discharged when becoming adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical practice
      in IBD diagnosis has changed after the PC. Upper endoscopy is a useful tool to
      find upper involvement in CD. Total colonoscopy with ileoscopy and performance of
      multiple biopsies are essential to determine extension of the inflammatory
      changes. We have not observed changes in the final diagnosis in our CD and UC
      patients after a median follow-up of 4 years.

AB  - In the West, the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases has
      increased in the past 50 years, up to 8-14/100,000 and 120-200/100,000 persons,
      respectively, for ulcerative colitis (UC) and 6-15/100,000 and 50-200/100,000
      persons, respectively, for Crohn's disease (CD). Studies of migrant populations
      and populations of developing countries demonstrated a recent, slow increase in
      the incidence of UC, whereas that of CD remained low, but CD incidence eventually
      increased to the level of UC. CD and UC are incurable; they begin in young
      adulthood and continue throughout life. The anatomic evolution of CD has been
      determined from studies of postoperative recurrence; CD begins with aphthous
      ulcers that develop into strictures or fistulas. Lesions usually arise in a
      single digestive segment; this site tends to be stable over time. Strictures and 
      fistulas are more frequent in patients with ileal disease, whereas Crohn's
      colitis remains uncomplicated for many years. Among patients with CD, intestinal 
      surgery is required for as many as 80% and a permanent stoma required in more
      than 10%. In patients with UC, the lesions usually remain superficial and extend 
      proximally; colectomy is required for 10%-30% of patients. Prognosis is difficult
      to determine. The mortality of patients with UC is not greater than that of the
      population, but patients with CD have greater mortality than the population. It
      has been proposed that only aggressive therapeutic approaches, based on treatment
      of early recurrent lesions in asymptomatic individuals, have a significant impact
      on progression of these chronic diseases.

AB  - Various genes that may influence the intestinal barrier have been identified,
      including MAGI2, PARD3, and MYO9B. These genes are associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) in several European studies. A total of 2,049 individuals
      (656 Crohn's disease [CD], 544 ulcerative colitis [UC], and 849 controls) were
      genotyped and association studies were performed for 1 single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) in MAGI2, 1 SNP in PARD3, and 6 SNPs in MYO9B. We reported an 
      association between 3 SNPs in MYO9B and ileal involvement with rs1457092 as the
      most significant SNP (p = 0.0073, odds ratio [OR] 0.69 [95% confidence interval
      (95% CI) 0.52-0.90]). The nonsynonymous SNP rs1545620 exhibited a p value of
      0.014, OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.55-0.93). MYO9B was not associated with UC. MAGI2 or
      PARD3 was not associated with IBD. A 6-SNP haplotype block in MYO9B demonstrated 
      association with CD and ileal CD (p = 0.0030 and 0.0065, respectively). These
      data demonstrate an association of MYO9B with ileal CD; however, there was no
      association of MAGI2 and PARD3 with IBD. Because the direction of association of 
      MYO9B in this Canadian study was not consistent with European studies, further
      studies are needed to elucidate the role of MYO9B in IBD.

TI  - Varicella immunity in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 386-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31821e1917 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Varicella zoster is a childhood disease that can cause devastating
      illness and death in immunocompromised individuals, including those who are
      taking steroids. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is managed by decreasing or
      controlling the inflammation using immunosuppression. Our objective was to show
      that at least 90% of patients newly diagnosed as having IBD had antibodies
      against varicella zoster and were protected by vaccination or natural disease.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all of the charts of the patients 
      diagnosed with IBD at the University of Buffalo's Digestive Diseases and
      Nutrition Center for 5 years from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009. RESULTS: 
      There were 163 new diagnoses of IBD during this time; 57% were boys. Mean age was
      12 years (range 1-19 years); 62% had Crohn disease, 33% ulcerative colitis, and
      5% indeterminate colitis. A total of 66% of all of the patients had a history of 
      disease or vaccination. Measurable titers against varicella were found in only
      77% of all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of varicella immunity is common in 
      children and adolescents at the time of diagnosis of IBD. Routine screening for
      varicella immune status may be warranted. Offering immunization to susceptible
      patients should confer protection, but this may be difficult to achieve once
      immune suppression has begun.

TI  - Nutritional modulation of the inflammatory bowel response.
PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1159/000323456 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The
      corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment 
      for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. 
      Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various
      chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and
      the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of
      reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of
      the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional
      treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote 
      the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify
      the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction.
      Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a
      significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional
      components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to
      present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the
      management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Association of vitamin K deficiency with bone metabolism and clinical disease
      activity in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1023-8
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2010.10.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process in 
      the digestive tract and patients with IBD develop osteopenia. Although vitamins K
      and D are important for maintaining bone health and inhibiting inflammation,
      their roles in patients with IBD are not clear. We investigated the roles of
      vitamins K and D in the bone health and inflammation in patients with IBD.
      METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD], n
      = 47, and ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 40) was measured with dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. Vitamin K and D levels of patients with IBD and healthy
      volunteers (n = 41) were evaluated by measuring serum undercarboxylated
      osteocalcin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, respectively. Clinical activity index
      was evaluated in patients with CD and UC. RESULTS: BMD was low in patients with
      CD and UC. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were significantly higher
      in patients with CD, but not with UC, compared with healthy subjects, indicating 
      that bone vitamin K is insufficient in patients with CD. The levels of
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin were significantly correlated with the clinical
      activity index of CD, although they were not correlated with BMD. The levels of
      1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly lower in patients with CD and UC than 
      in healthy subjects. The levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D were inversely
      correlated with BMD in patients with UC and were not correlated with the clinical
      activity index of CD. CONCLUSION: Vitamins K and D are insufficient in patients
      with IBD. Insufficiency of vitamin K is suggested to be associated with
      inflammatory processes of CD.

TI  - Idiopathic pancreatitis preceding the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is 
      more frequent in pediatric patients.
PG  - 714-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182065cad [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be a rare extraintestinal 
      manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There are only a few reports
      of AP presenting before the diagnosis of IBD. We aimed to characterize the
      demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients with IBD in whom AP
      preceded disease onset and compare the presentation of AP between children and
      adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric and adult patients presenting with AP as 
      the first symptom of IBD were retrospectively identified (10 years, 7 university 
      hospitals). Demographic and clinical data, IBD type, disease extension, and
      laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Imaging methods, number of AP
      episodes, and lag time between onset of first pancreatitis episode and onset of
      IBD were recorded. RESULTS: AP preceding the diagnosis of IBD was found in 10 in 
      460 pediatric patients with IBD (2.17%), compared with only 2 in 3500 adults
      (0.06%). Eight children had colonic disease (4 Crohn disease, 4 ulcerative
      colitis [3 pancolitis]). Mean amylase level was 1419 and range 100 to 1370. Three
      children (30%) had mildly elevated transaminases. Median time between onset of
      first episode of AP in relation to onset of IBD was 24 (range 1-156) weeks. AP
      most commonly presented with abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: IBD presenting as AP
      was more frequent among the pediatric population with IBD in comparison to
      adults. It was more common in patients with colitis than in those with ileal
      disease, suggesting that patients with idiopathic AP should be observed carefully
      for a possible diagnosis of IBD.

TI  - Does anti-TNF therapy reduce the requirement for surgery in ulcerative colitis? A
      systematic review.
PG  - 1440-7
AB  - Infliximab has demonstrated its efficacy in moderate to severe ulcerative
      colitis. The Active Ulcerative Colitis Trial (ACT) -1 and 2 have demonstrated the
      beneficial impact of infliximab on the short-term colectomy rate. However, data
      evaluating this outcome beyond one year remains scarce. To provide evidence on
      the potential impact of infliximab on the long-term colectomy rate in patients
      suffering from ulcerative colitis, data was reviewed from randomized and
      controlled studies, referral centre studies and population-based studies, in
      adult and pediatric populations. In the pre-biologic era, 9-33%, 50% and 29% of
      adult patients with ulcerative colitis underwent colectomy in clinical trials,
      referral center studies and population-based cohorts, respectively. In the
      pediatric population, 9-61% and 8-20% underwent colectomy in referral centers and
      population-based cohorts, respectively. Between 10 and 36% of adult patients
      treated with infliximab for ulcerative colitis underwent colectomy in clinical
      trials, referral center studies and population-based cohorts. In the pediatric
      population treated with infliximab, long-term data is lacking, with colectomy
      rates ranging from 16 to 28%. Whether infliximab proves to be a disease modifying
      treatment in ulcerative colitis in the long term remains to be elucidated and
      will require further long-term prospective studies.

LID - 10.1002/ibd.21654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the incidence, treatment, surgery rate, and
      anthropometry at diagnosis of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      METHODS: Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 in
      Eastern Denmark, Funen, and Aarhus were included from a background population of 
      668,056 children <15 years of age. For evaluation of incidence, treatment, and
      surgery rate, a subcohort from Eastern Denmark was extracted for comparison with 
      a previously published population-based cohort from the same geographical area
      (1998-2006). RESULTS: In all, 130 children with IBD: 65 with Crohn's disease
      (CD), 62 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and three with IBD unclassified (IBDU)
      were included. The mean incidence rates per 10(6) in 2007-2009 were: IBD: 6.4
      (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4-7.7), CD: 3.2 (2.5-4.1), UC: 3.1 (2.4-4.0) and
      IBDU: 0.2 (0.05-0.5). Comparing the two cohorts from Eastern Denmark we found
      higher incidence rates for IBD (5.0 and 7.2 in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009,
      respectively, P = 0.02) and CD (2.3 versus 3.3, P = 0.04). Furthermore, we found 
      a significant decrease in surgery rates (15.8/100 person-years versus 4.2, P =
      0.02) and an increase in the rate of initiating immunomodulators (IM) within the 
      first year (29.0/100 person-years versus 69.2, P < 0.001). IM use was associated 
      with a trend towards a decreased surgery risk (relative risk [RR] 0.38;
      0.15-1.0). Children with CD had poor nutritional status at diagnosis compared
      with the general pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 12 years we
      found an increase in the incidence of IBD in children, an increasing use of IM,
      and decreasing 1-year surgery rates. CD patients had poor nutritional status.

AB  - In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids,
      especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the
      innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that
      improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might
      have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of
      fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list
      over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a
      low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was
      evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of
      chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants
      were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs
      with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some
      of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and 
      rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for 
      risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible
      benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for 
      convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though
      formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty
      acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings,
      especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions
      such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to
      enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and
      these questions merit randomized trials.

PG  - 233-7
LID - 10.1258/acb.2010.010093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) on tumour necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8) in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) has not yet been examined. The aim of the present study
      was to determine the effect of administration of GBF on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and
      -8 levels in UC patients in remission. METHODS: Forty-one patients with UC were
      divided into two groups, namely control and GBF group. Twenty-one patients in the
      control group received standard treatment while 20 patients in the GBF group
      received 30 g of GBF daily by oral administration during two months of the study 
      along with standard drug therapy. RESULTS: Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 all
      decreased in the GBF group compared with baseline during the two-month study,
      while in the control group all values rose. For IL-6 and -8 this effect was
      significant, P = 0.034 and 0.013, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the
      present study showed that the consumption of GBF may reduce the level of serum
      TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 in patients with UC. This investigation was designed as a 
      pilot study and the results may provide a basis for more future clinical trials.

TI  - Using optical markers of nondysplastic rectal epithelial cells to identify
      patients with ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasia.
PG  - 2427-35
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21639 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current surveillance guidelines for patients with long-standing
      ulcerative colitis (UC) recommend repeated colonoscopy with random biopsies,
      which is time-consuming, discomforting, and expensive. A less invasive strategy
      is to identify neoplasia by analyzing biomarkers from the more accessible rectum 
      to predict the need for a full colonoscopy. The goal of this pilot study was to
      evaluate whether optical markers of rectal mucosa derived from a novel optical
      technique, partial-wave spectroscopic microscopy (PWS), could identify UC
      patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer (CA) present anywhere in their
      colon. METHODS: Banked frozen nondysplastic mucosal rectal biopsies were used
      from 28 UC patients (15 without dysplasia and 13 with concurrent HGD or CA). The 
      specimen slides were made using a touch prep method and underwent PWS analysis.
      We divided the patients into two groups: 13 as a training set and an independent 
      15 as a validation set. RESULTS: We identified six optical markers, ranked by
      measuring the information gain with respect to the outcome of cancer. The most
      effective markers were selected by maximizing the cross-validated training
      accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier. The optimal classifier was applied to the
      validation data yielding 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results indicate that the PWS-derived optical markers can accurately predict UC
      patients with HGD/CA through assessment of rectal epithelial cells. By aiming for
      high sensitivity, our approach could potentially simplify the surveillance of UC 
      patients and improve overall resource utilization by identifying patients with
      HGD/CA who should proceed with colonoscopy.

TI  - Upregulation of P-glycoprotein by probiotics in intestinal epithelial cells and
      in the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis in mice.
PG  - G1115-23
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00027.2011 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediates efflux of xenobiotics and bacterial toxins from
      the intestinal mucosa into the lumen. Dysregulation of P-gp has been implicated
      in inflammatory bowel disease. Certain probiotics have been shown to be effective
      in treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, direct effects of probiotics on 
      P-gp are not known. Current studies examined the effects of Lactobacilli on P-gp 
      function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 monolayers and a
      mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were utilized. P-gp
      activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive [(3)H]digoxin transepithelial flux. 
      Multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1)/P-gp expression was measured by real-time
      quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Culture supernatant (CS; 1:10 or 1:50, 24 h)
      of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment of
      differentiated Caco-2 monolayers (21 days postplating) increased ( approximately 
      3-fold) MDR1/P-gp mRNA and protein levels. L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus CS
      stimulated P-gp activity ( approximately 2-fold, P < 0.05) via phosphoinositide
      3-kinase and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways. In mice, L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus
      treatment (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) increased mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein 
      expression in the ileum and colon (2- to 3-fold). In the dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS)-induced colitis model (3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days), the degree of 
      colitis as judged by histological damage and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced
      by L. acidophilus. L. acidophilus treatment to DSS-treated mice blocked the
      reduced expression of mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein in the distal colon. These
      findings suggest that Lactobacilli or their soluble factors stimulate P-gp
      expression and function under normal and inflammatory conditions. These data
      provide insights into a novel mechanism involving P-gp upregulation in beneficial
      effects of probiotics in intestinal inflammatory disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is efficacious therapy for adults with Crohn's disease
      (CD). AIM: To summarise the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland paediatric
      adalimumab experience. METHODS: British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN) members with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 
      patients <18 years old commencing adalimumab with at least 4 weeks follow-up.
      Patient demographics and details of treatment were then collected. Response and
      remission was assessed using the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      (PCDAI)/Physicians Global Assessment (PGA). RESULTS: Seventy-two patients [70 CD,
      1 ulcerative colitis (UC), 1 IBD unclassified (IBDU)] from 19 paediatric-centres 
      received adalimumab at a median age of 14.8 (IQR 3.1, range 6.1-17.8) years;
      66/70 CD (94%) had previously received infliximab. A dose of 80 mg then 40 mg was
      used for induction in 41(59%) and 40 mg fortnightly for maintenance in 61 (90%). 
      Remission rates were 24%, 58% and 41% at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively.
      Overall 43 (61%) went into remission at some point, with 24 (35%) requiring
      escalation of therapy. Remission rates were higher in those on concomitant
      immunosuppression cf. those not on immunosuppression [34/46 (74%) vs. 9/24 (37%),
      respectively, (chi(2) 8.8, P=0.003)]. There were 15 adverse events (21%)
      including four (6%) serious adverse events with two sepsis related deaths in
      patients who were also on immunosuppression and home parenteral nutrition (3%
      mortality rate). CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in treatment of refractory
      paediatric patients with a remission rate of 61%. This treatment benefit should
      be balanced against side effects, including in this study a 3% mortality rate.

TI  - Methotrexate in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: an 8-year
      retrospective study in a Canadian pediatric IBD center.
PG  - 2521-6
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21653 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is used as an alternative immunosuppressive
      treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the
      study was to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of MTX for children with IBD.
      METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in our pediatric IBD center of all
      children having received MTX for the treatment of their IBD between 2000 and
      2008. Remission was defined as discontinuation of steroids and Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index <4 for Crohn's disease (CD) patients or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index (PUCAI) <10 for ulcerative (UC) or indeterminate colitis (IC)
      patients. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients had CD, 5 UC, and 13 IC. Mean age at
      diagnosis was 11 (0.6-17.4) years. Ninety patients were previously treated with
      purine analogs and 26 with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Among patients
      assessed for effectiveness of MTX (n = 79), clinical remission was observed in
      29, 37, 25, and 16% of CD patients (n = 63) and 19, 25, 13, and 7% of patients
      with UC or IC (n = 16), respectively, 3, 6,12, and 24 months after initiation of 
      MTX. The 1-year remission rate for CD patients was significantly higher in
      patients with colonic disease. Forty-six patients (49%) experienced side effects 
      but only 13 (14%) had to discontinue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term
      remission rate with MTX in our pediatric IBD population was low. However, MTX was
      generally well tolerated and induced and maintained remission in some patients
      who previously had failed a purine analog and/or anti-TNF. Prospective controlled
      trials are indicated to determine the place of MTX in the management of pediatric
      IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New medical therapies have improved outlook in inflammatory bowel
      disease but published impact on surgical rates has been modest suggesting that
      many patients are still not attaining remission. AIM: To review remission rates
      with current medical treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: We
      searched MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1966 to January, 2011). RESULTS: Induction and
      maintenance of remission was observed in 20% (range, 9-29.5%) and 53% (range,
      36.8-59.6%) of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients treated with oral 5-ASA
      derivatives. Induction of remission was noted in 52% (range, 48-58%) of Crohn's
      disease (CD) patients and 54% of UC patients treated with steroids in
      population-based cohorts. Maintenance of remission was reported in 71% (range,
      56-95%) of CD patients on azathioprine over a 6-month to 2-year period and in 60%
      (range, 41.7-82.4%) in UC at 1 year or longer. Induction and maintenance of
      remission was noted in 39% (range, 19.3-66.7%) and 70% (range, 39-90%) of CD
      patients on methotrexate over a 40-week period. Induction of remission was
      reported in 32% (range, 25-48%), 26% (range, 18-36%) and 20% (range, 19-23%) of
      CD patients on infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab pegol, respectively. The
      corresponding figures were 45% (range, 39-59%), 43% (range, 40-47%) and 47.9% at 
      weeks 20-30 among initial responders. Induction of remission was observed in 33% 
      (range, 27.5-38.8%) and 18.5% of UC patients on infliximab or adalimumab,
      respectively. Maintenance of remission was noted in 33% (range, 25.6-36.9%) of UC
      patients on infliximab at week 30. Approximately one-fifth of CD and UC patients 
      treated with biologicals require intestinal resection after 2-5 years in
      referral-centre studies. CONCLUSION: In the era of biologics, the proportion of
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease not entering remission remains high.

TI  - STAT6 activation in ulcerative colitis: a new target for prevention of
      IL-13-induced colon epithelial cell dysfunction.
PG  - 2224-34
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21628 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is upregulated in ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
      increases colon epithelial permeability by inducing apoptosis and expression of
      the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2. IL-13 induces activation of
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). However, the STAT6
      phosphorylation status in patients with UC is unknown, as is the effect of STAT6 
      inhibition on colonic epithelium exposed to IL-13. The study aims were to
      determine if mucosal STAT6 phosphorylation is increased in patients with UC, and 
      if STAT6 inhibition attenuates IL-13-induced colon epithelial cell dysfunction.
      METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated (p) STAT6 was performed 
      on colonic tissue from newly diagnosed pediatric subjects with UC (early UC) or
      Crohn's disease (CD), colectomy tissue from adults with UC (advanced UC), and
      controls. Colon HT-29 and T84 cells were transfected with STAT6 small interfering
      RNA (siRNA), or treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone
      deacetylase inhibitor that inhibits STAT6, prior to IL-13 treatment. RESULTS: The
      median score for epithelial pSTAT6 was 0 in control subjects, 2 in early UC
      (versus control P = 0.019), 4 in advanced UC (P = 0.003), and 0 in CD (P = 0.4). 
      Cell transfection with STAT6 siRNA prevented IL-13-induced apoptosis and
      claudin-2 expression. SAHA inhibited IL-13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation,
      apoptosis, and claudin-2 expression, and mitigated IL-13-induced reductions in
      transepithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: UC is associated with increased colonic 
      epithelial STAT6 phosphorylation, and STAT6 inhibition prevents IL-13-induced
      apoptosis and barrier disruption. These data identify STAT6 as a novel target for
      UC treatment and support further study of SAHA as a therapeutic agent.

TI  - Maternal methyl-donor supplementation induces prolonged murine offspring colitis 
      susceptibility in association with mucosal epigenetic and microbiomic changes.
PG  - 1687-96
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr044 [doi]
AB  - Developmental epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been recognized
      as potential pathogenic factors in inflammatory bowel diseases, the hallmark of
      which is an exaggerated immune response against luminal microbes. A methyl-donor 
      (MD) diet can modify DNA methylation at select murine genomic loci during early
      development. The components of the MDs are routinely incorporated into prenatal
      human supplements. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal MD
      supplementation on offspring colitis susceptibility and colonic mucosal DNA
      methylation and gene expression changes in mice as a model. Additionally, we
      investigated the offspring mucosal microbiomic response to the maternal dietary
      supplementation. Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic mucosa
      from offspring of MD-supplemented mothers following reversal to control diet at
      weaning was interrogated by methylation-specific microarrays and pyrosequencing
      at postnatal days 30 (P30) and P90. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed by
      microarray profiling and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction. The mucosal microbiome was studied by high throughput pyrosequencing of
      16S rRNA. Maternal MD supplementation induced a striking susceptibility to
      colitis in offspring. This phenotype was associated with colonic mucosal DNA
      methylation and expression changes. Metagenomic analyses did not reveal
      consistent bacteriomic differences between P30 and P90, but showed a prolonged
      effect of the diet on the offspring mucosal microbiome. In conclusion, maternal
      MD supplementation increases offspring colitis susceptibility that associates
      with persistent epigenetic and prolonged microbiomic changes. These findings
      underscore that epigenomic reprogramming relevant to mammalian colitis can occur 
      during early development in response to maternal dietary modifications.

AB  - AIM: To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium
      lactis (B. lactis) in an adoptive transfer model of colitis. METHODS: Donor and
      recipient mice received either B. lactis or bacterial culture medium as control
      (deMan Rogosa Sharpe) in drinking water for one week prior to transfer of a mix
      of naive and regulatory T cells until sacrifice. RESULTS: All recipient mice
      developed signs of colonic inflammation, but a significant reduction of weight
      loss was observed in B. lactis-fed recipient mice compared to control mice.
      Moreover, a trend toward a diminution of mucosal thickness and attenuated
      epithelial damage was revealed. Colonic expression of pro-inflammatory and T cell
      markers was significantly reduced in B. lactis-fed recipient mice compared to
      controls. Concomitantly, forkhead box protein 3, a marker of regulatory T cells, 
      was significantly up-regulated by B. lactis. CONCLUSION: Daily oral
      administration of B. lactis was able to reduce inflammatory and T cells mediators
      and to promote regulatory T cells specific markers in a mouse model of colitis.

AB  - Thromboembolic events are one of the important extraintestinal manifestations of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases that are associated with considerable morbidity and
      mortality. Iliac vein thrombosis is rarely reported in inflammatory bowel
      diseases. A 9.5 year-old girl was presented with joint pain, nausea, vomiting and
      weight loss. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and right internal iliac vein
      thrombosis. With the implementation of immunosuppressive and anticoagulant
      therapies clinical picture has improved and thrombosis has resolved. Timely
      diagnosis and early treatment of extraintestinal complications of inflammatory
      bowel diseases might be lifesaving.

      therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 48-53
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.08.007 [doi]
AB  - Thiopurines represent an effective and widely used immunosuppressant in the
      therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease. However up to 25% of
      patients may be unable to continue the drug due to side effects. The incidence of
      hepatotoxicity associated with thiopurine use is reported between 0% and 32%.
      Veno-occlusive disease, peliosis hepatis, perisinusoidal fibrosis and nodular
      regenerative hyperplasia have all been described with thiopurines. Recent trials 
      of 6-tioguanine, although successful in patients with allergies to azathioprine
      or mercaptopurine, have been compromised by increased hepatotoxicity, either
      veno-occlusive disease or nodular regenerative hyperplasia. We describe a report 
      of nodular regenerative hyperplasia in a Crohn's disease patient associated with 
      6-mercaptopurine therapy and have reviewed the management and the literature
      regarding this complication. Our report strengthens the importance of further
      safety studies to evaluate the etiology, prevalence, risk factors and screening
      modalities for hepatotoxicity, in particular of nodular regenerative hyperplasia,
      in patients treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease.

      disease.
PG  - 13-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.07.021 [doi]
AB  - Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is defined as a "state of nutrition in which a 
      deficiency or excess (or imbalance) of energy, protein, and other nutrients
      causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and
      composition) and function, and clinical outcome". Although this definition
      resulted from a long discussion among experts, it lacks concise assessment
      criteria. Essential to an effective practice of nutrition support, however, is
      the ability to identify who actually needs medical nutrition therapy. Patients
      with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are a high risk group for
      protein-energy malnutrition, with a prevalence ranging up to 75%.

TI  - Consensus for managing acute severe ulcerative colitis in children: a systematic 
      review and joint statement from ECCO, ESPGHAN, and the Porto IBD Working Group of
      ESPGHAN.
PG  - 574-88
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.481 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASC) is a potentially
      life-threatening disease. We aimed to formulate guidelines for managing ASC in
      children based on systematic review of the literature and robust consensus
      process. This manuscript is a product of a joint effort of the ECCO (European
      Crohn's and Colitis Organization), the Pediatric Porto Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      (IBD) Working group of ESPGHAN (European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition) and ESPGHAN. METHODS: A group of 19 experts in
      pediatric IBD participated in an iterative consensus process including two
      face-to-face meetings. A total of 17 predefined questions were addressed by
      working subgroups based on a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: The
      recommendations and practice points were eventually endorsed with a consensus
      rate of at least 95% regarding: definitions, initial evaluation, standard
      therapy, timing of second-line therapy, the role of endoscopic evaluation and
      heparin prophylaxis, how to administer second-line medical therapy, how to assess
      response, surgical considerations, and discharge recommendations. A management
      flowchart is presented based on daily scoring of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index (PUCAI), along with 28 formal recommendations and 34 practice
      points. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide
      the management of ASC in children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a
      standardized protocol that allows effective monitoring of disease progress and
      timely treatment escalation when needed.

      center's experience.
PG  - 50-3
LID - 10.1007/s12519-011-0245-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: we aimed to analyze clinical and inflammatory markers of steroid
      non-response in patients with moderate/severe ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time
      of diagnosis. METHODS: this study included patients who were graded as having
      moderate/severe UC and received corticosteroids as first-line therapy.
      Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings and pediatric ulcerative colitis
      activity scores (PUCAS) were recorded. Response to corticosteroids was assessed
      30 days after the induction and long-term therapy. RESULTS: twenty-eight children
      were diagnosed as having moderate/severe UC. Their mean age +/- SD was 1 2.2 +/- 
      4 years, and 17% were under 5 years of age. PUCAS at their initial admission was 
      56.9 +/- 11.8. UC was observed at the left colon in 9 patients (32.1%), and
      pancolitis in 19 (67.9%). At the end of the 30th day, UC was completely remitted 
      in 15 patients (53.5%), partially remitted in 2 (7.1%), and no response in 11
      (39.2%). Short-term follow-up showed partial remission in 2 patients, and overall
      remission with steroid in 17 (60.7%). Non-responders were given second-line
      treatment; steroid dependency was documented in 2 patients (7.1%) and another 2
      (7.1%) patients underwent colectomy. Predictors for steroid non-response were
      analyzed and only PUCAS at the initial admission was found to be associated with 
      non-response to steroids (51.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 65.4 +/- 6.8, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      approximately half of the pediatric patients had complete response to steroid
      therapy in a long period. PUCAS could be used as a potential marker of "failed
      response" to steroid, but should be supported with a number of prospective
      randomized controlled studies.

TI  - Octreotide for symptomatic treatment of diarrhea due to cytomegalovirus colitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the improvement of diarrhea in a patient with
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis who was treated with octreotide after failure of
      loperamide. CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old male presented with chronic diarrhea and
      CMV colitis; he had been experiencing protracted diarrhea since 2006. In October 
      2009 he failed a 21-day course of valgancyclovir 900 mg orally twice daily.
      Several months later, due to continuing diarrhea and progressive malnutrition, a 
      colonoscopy and subsequent biopsy again showed CMV. In March 2010 he was started 
      on a 28-day course of intravenous ganciclovir 130 mg daily. Three weeks into
      treatment he continued with copious amounts of diarrhea, with no relief from
      loperamide, which was titrated from 2 mg/day to 2 mg every 6 hours. On day 20 of 
      ganciclovir treatment he was started on octreotide 50 mug subcutaneously every 8 
      hours; within a few days, the patient began to experience decreased stool
      frequency and consistency. He completed the full 28-day course of ganciclovir,
      with octreotide continuing unchanged, with much improvement in his diarrheal
      symptoms and improvement in appetite, nutritional status, and quality of life.
      DISCUSSION: Studies regarding the treatment of CMV colitis-associated diarrhea
      are scarce, and are typically limited to treating the underlying cause with
      antiviral medications and with the addition of antimotility agents. Three cases
      have been reported in the literature in which octreotide was used for the
      symptomatic treatment of diarrhea, none of which was refractory to loperamide.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known case of a patient with chronic diarrhea due 
      to CMV colitis that was unresponsive to loperamide, required protracted antiviral
      treatment (valgancyclovir and gancyclovir), and subsequently experienced relief
      by the use of octreotide 50 mug subcutaneously every 8 hours.

PG  - 417-27
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04541.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do 
      not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs.
      Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable
      or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of
      nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to
      corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to
      identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series
      and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach
      relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose,
      and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate,
      thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional 
      therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin
      in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may
      respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence
      base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.

AB  - Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often
      necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these
      operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed
      patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional 
      outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence
      (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed 
      in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 
      had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of
      85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1
      stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent
      enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to
      significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The
      transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of 
      unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years
      required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one 
      death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and
      ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective
      ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in
      five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13)
      stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean
      Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All
      attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than
      18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had
      ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves
      frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a
      reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons
      should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and
      families.

PG  - G191-201

AB  - Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect 
      bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may
      contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and
      inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. 
      It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased
      mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone
      resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD 
      and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge
      the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly
      complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss.
      Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation)
      are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical
      for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted
      therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of 
      inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and
      phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential
      limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.

LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181eb5a9f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Variation in the prevalence of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases
      in different geographical regions has not been extensively studied. The aim of
      the present study was to define the regional and national prevalence of
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, and differences in practice approaches.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered a survey electronically to members of the
      American College of Gastroenterology, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma,
      and Immunology, and the North American Society Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition. Questions pertained to the number and proportion of
      patients seen with eosinophilic gastroenteritis or colitis and eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE), and methods used to diagnose and treat these conditions.
      RESULTS: A total of 1836 physicians responded from 10,874 requests (17%
      response). Extrapolating responses from our US sample, we estimated an overall
      prevalence of 52 and 28/100,000 for EoE and eosinophilic gastroenteritis or
      colitis. The patient burden of EoE is higher in urban (0.58) and suburban (0.44) 
      compared with rural settings (0.36, P < 0.0065), observations consistent with
      other allergic disorders. There was also increased prevalence in northeast region
      when calculated by prevalence per 100,000. There was considerable variability in 
      criteria and initial treatment options used to diagnose EoE. Only one-third of
      respondents reported using diagnostic criteria proposed in a 2007 consensus
      document. Seventy-one and 35% of respondents reported treating some patients with
      EoE with a food elimination or elemental diet, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EoE is 
      diagnosed more often in northeastern states and urban areas. There is
      considerable variability in diagnostic criteria and initial treatment approach
      supporting the need for additional clinical trials and consensus development.

AB  - The United States spends more for healthcare than any other country in the world.
      With the rising prevalence of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents the leading chronic gastrointestinal 
      disease with increasing healthcare expenditures in the US. IBD costs have shifted
      from inpatient to outpatient care since the introduction of biologic therapies as
      the standard of care. Gastroenterologists need to be aware of the national cost
      burden of IBD and clinical practices that optimize cost-efficiency. This
      investigation offers a systematic review of the economics of IBD and
      evidence-based strategies for cost-effective management.

LID - 10.1002/ibd.21463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gene-environment interplay modulates inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD). Dioxin-like compounds can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and
      alter macrophage function as well as T-cell polarization. We hypothesized that
      attenuation of the AhR signaling pathway will ameliorate colitis in a murine
      model of IBD. METHODS: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis was induced in
      C57BL/6 AhR null mice (AhR(-/-) ), heterozygous mice (AhR(-/+) ), and their
      wildtype (WT) littermates. Clinical and morphopathological parameters were used
      to compare the groups. PATIENTS: AhR pathway activation was analyzed in biopsy
      specimens from 25 IBD patients and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: AhR(-/-) mice
      died before the end of the treatment. However, AhR(-/+) mice exhibited decreased 
      disease activity compared to WT mice. The AhR(-/+) mice expressed less
      proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (6.1-
      versus 15.7-fold increase) and IL17 (23.7- versus 67.9-fold increase) and
      increased antiinflammatory IL-10 (2.3-fold increase) compared with the AhR(+/+)
      mice in the colon. Colonic macrophage infiltration was attenuated in the AhR(-/+)
      group. AhR and its downstream targets were significantly upregulated in IBD
      patients versus control (CYP1A1 -19.9, and IL8- 10-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS:
      Attenuation of the AhR receptor expression resulted in a protective effect during
      DSS-induced colitis, while the absence of AhR exacerbated the disease. Abnormal
      AhR pathway activation in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients may promote
      chronic inflammation. Modulation of AhR signaling pathway via the diet, cessation
      of smoking, or administration of AhR antagonists could be viable strategies for
      the treatment of IBD.

AB  - Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need
      to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American
      Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national
      guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may
      differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of
      Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics 
      in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions 
      of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of
      activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid
      dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease,
      in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer;
      risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special
      situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical
      literature and clinical experience of a national working group.

TI  - Physician assessment of ulcerative colitis activity correlates poorly with
      endoscopic disease activity.
PG  - 1008-14
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective physician assessment is the cornerstone of routine
      ulcerative colitis (UC) management. Endoscopic and histologic assessment of UC
      provides objective measures of inflammatory disease activity. The level of
      agreement between physician impression of UC activity and endoscopic disease
      activity has not been evaluated. The aim was to assess the level of agreement
      between physician's clinical impression of UC disease activity and endoscopic and
      histologic findings of inflammation. METHODS: Using the Medical Archival
      Retrieval System at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, we reviewed
      clinical information on all UC patients between 1995 and 2008 who had clinic
      visits recorded prior to colonoscopy. Clinical UC disease activity was defined by
      the physician's clinical impression and the endoscopic and histologic activity by
      colonoscopy with biopsy. The level of agreement between colonoscopy assessment of
      UC with histologic and clinical assessment was determined by sensitivity,
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the kappa coefficient. 
      RESULTS: There were 369 UC patients who had a clinic visit proximate to a
      colonoscopy. The mean age of patients was 46 +/- 16 years (50% female). The
      performance of clinical impression in recognizing disease activity, as determined
      by endoscopy, was relatively poor: sensitivity = 56.0%, predictive value negative
      = 56.8%, kappa coefficient = 0.35. In contrast, the performance of histological
      evaluation in recognizing disease activity was markedly better: sensitivity =
      93.5%, predictive value negative = 89.1%, kappa coefficient = 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The physician's clinical impression of UC activity shows poor agreement with
      endoscopy and histology, with over one-third of patients with chronic
      inflammation underrecognized by clinical impression. The consequences of
      underestimated UC activity by clinical assessment may include undertreatment of
      active disease and uncontrolled chronic inflammation.

TI  - Body composition in childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 112-5
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

TI  - Is Crohn's creeping fat an adipose tissue?
PG  - 747-57
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21413 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In human pathology, the "creeping fat" (CF) of the mesentery is
      unique to Crohn's disease (CD). CF is usually referred to as an ectopic extension
      of mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT). However, since no animal model developing CF 
      has ever been established, very little is known about this type of fat-depot
      expansion and its role in the development of the disease. METHODS: We developed
      and standardized an experimental protocol in mice that reproducibly induces CF
      development when a severe colonic inflammation is obtained by intracolonic
      instillation of DNBS. RESULTS: Macro-microscopic observations revealed a fatty
      appearance of CF. Yet when compared to MAT from the same animals, CF contains
      very little triglycerides, few adipocytes, and we observed a very low expression 
      and protein levels of both adipose markers (hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin) 
      and adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin). The decreased expression of perilipin
      in CF was also observed by immunohistochemistry. Conversely, the expression of
      proinflammatory and fibrous markers (Pref-1) was much higher in CF than in MAT.
      These observations were fully consistent with those made on CF recovered from
      five CD patients and compared with subcutaneous and mesenteric fat from the same 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this work reports an original experimental
      mice model of CF. In this model we establish for the first time that CF only
      occurs in severe colonic inflammation and shows an inflammatory, fibrous but not 
      an adipose pattern.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease aggregation in Utah kindreds.
PG  - 823-30
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The observed heritability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      incompletely explained by known genetic risk factors. Kindred-specific genetic
      variants that cause IBD may be a source of "missing heritability." Given that
      they have been previously difficult to identify, we sought to identify high-risk 
      IBD kindreds. METHODS: We used a large population-based database--the Utah
      Population Database (UPDB)--which contains genealogical and healthcare data to
      characterize the risk of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD
      in kindreds. We identified CD and UC cases using ICD-9 codes. We calculated the
      adjusted relative risk to relatives of affected individuals. We calculated the
      familial standardized incidence ratio (FSIR) to quantify the kindred-specific
      disease risk. RESULTS: In all, 3601 CD cases and 3976 UC cases met inclusion
      criteria. A total of 655 CD kindreds and 615 UC kindreds had a statistical excess
      of disease. Risk of disease varied among kindreds, with some kindreds
      demonstrating approximately 20-fold elevated risk. For CD, UC, and IBD, relative 
      risks were significantly elevated for first- and second-degree relatives and
      first cousins. The adjusted population attributable risks for familial CD, UC,
      and IBD were 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.23); 0.17 (0.14-0.21);
      and 0.19 (0.17-0.22), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple kindreds 
      with a statistical excess of CD, UC, and IBD, and validated the UPDB as a
      resource for family studies in IBD. Given the need for novel genetic mapping
      strategies to explain the apparent missing heritability in IBD, further studies
      of these high-risk kindreds is justified.

TI  - Digestive complication in severe malnourished anorexia nervosa patient: a case
      report of necrotizing colitis.
PG  - 91-3
LID - 10.1002/eat.20778 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing colitis (NC) represents a severe, although rare,
      complication in patients with anorexia nervosa. OBJECTIVE: We report the only
      case of NC with good prognosis in a severely malnourished AN patient. METHOD:
      Available patient records, imaging, and biochemical data were evaluated.
      DISCUSSION: This case represents an unusual gastrointestinal complication and
      underlines the important clinical role that Parenteral Nutrition (PN) has for
      some selected very malnourished AN patients. The severe starvation may compromise
      the normal function of gastrointestinal tract and it can also lead to an
      incomplete tolerance of enteral refeeding thus making PN required to reach the
      nutritional rehabilitation.
