AB  - The mechanisms of nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have not been
      thoroughly established. It is likely that a further understanding of the
      underlying disease process will allow better understanding of these forms of
      therapy, with a sounder rationale for the construction of specific diet
      constituents for therapy. Regardless, nutritional therapy is likely to be
      multidimensional, and various forms may affect different aspects of the disease
      process. Decreased inflammatory factors, decreased antigenic stimuli, provision
      of essential nutrients, improved immune function, and other factors may all be of
      varying importance in different patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Little 
      work has been done on the role of diet therapy in the long-term treatment of
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease as a method of preventing relapse.
      Parenteral nutrition and elemental diets appear to have limited roles in this
      area. Some investigation has been done to see if minor modifications of the
      normal diet can prolong remission periods. Low-fiber diets are frequently
      recommended for patients with strictures. Whether this has any significant effect
      on symptoms, inflammation, or complications is unclear. Heaton et al suggested
      that a high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrate diet resulted in fewer and shorter
      hospitalizations. In a prospective follow-up study by Ritchie et al, however,
      these results were not able to be reproduced. Exclusion diets have also been
      suggested as a means of reducing relapse rates in patients with Crohn's disease. 
      In a small, randomized, controlled trial of an exclusion diet versus an unrefined
      carbohydrate, fiber-rich diet, there were significantly fewer relapses among the 
      patients treated with the exclusion diet at 6 months. These diets require
      intensive patient cooperation, but the potential side effects are minimal.
      Clearly, these findings need to be reproduced in large, prospective, randomized, 
      controlled studies before widespread use can be advocated. A great deal of data
      exists on the use of nutritional supplementation in the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease, although little of it is in the form of large, randomized,
      controlled studies. Nutritional manipulation currently has a limited role in
      patients with ulcerative colitis; a much broader role exists in patients with
      Crohn's disease. The mechanisms by which nutritional therapy affects these
      diseases may include a combination of factors--decreased antigenic exposure,
      improved immune function, and provision of essential nutrients and calories
      needed for bowel regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children.

AB  - IBD is one of the most significant chronic diseases afflicting children and
      adolescents. As in adults, UC and CD constitute the two major disease entities,
      with many of the characteristics of these two diseases being similar in adults
      and children. With technical advances, a complete endoscopic examination of the
      colon and terminal ileum can be performed in most children without difficulty.
      There are, however, a number of aspects of the presentation, course, and
      management of these diseases that are unique to the pediatric population. Because
      the impact of inadequate nutrition is much greater in the growing child than in
      adults, growth failure is a common, serious complication of malnutrition in this 
      population. The psychological impact of a chronic illness on both the developing 
      child and the family can also be significant. The management of this population
      is further complicated by the lack of adequate studies that assess not only the
      effect of a medical or surgical therapy on disease activity, but also address the
      issues of growth and pubertal development. It has been a challenge to extrapolate
      data from adult studies to the pediatric population. The management of children
      and adolescents requires a critical understanding of the differences between
      pediatric and adult patients to maximize growth potential and minimize longterm
      sequelae of treatment. After a long period of limited controlled studies,
      however, collaborative efforts are underway to investigate most aspects of
      pediatric IBD, and we look forward to exciting advances toward the optimal
      management of children and adolescents with IBD.

PG  - 707-11
AB  - Tests that positively identify individuals with ulcerative colitis,
      distinguishing them from patients with Crohn disease or other causes of colitis, 
      have not been reliable. Genetic predisposition to inflammatory bowel diseases and
      genetic influence on immune regulation resulted in the clinical evaluation of
      potential serologic markers. In adults the presence of anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in serum identifies patients with ulcerative colitis.
      In this study we demonstrated that high levels of ANCA are present in 83% of
      children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, the majority of
      patients with ulcerative colitis had a perinuclear pattern of these antibodies by
      indirect immunofluorescence. The combination of a positive ANCA and perinuclear
      indirect immunofluorescence pattern was 97% specific for ulcerative colitis. We
      conclude that determination of ANCA is a sensitive and specific clinical test for
      identification of children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Mechanisms of decreased food intake during weight loss in adult Crohn's disease
      patients without obvious malabsorption.
PG  - 775-81
AB  - Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated
      with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without
      malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients
      without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with
      weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group,
      food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed
      less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to
      eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was
      also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no
      difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure.
      Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather
      than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on
      the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.

TI  - Surgical patients with pseudomembranous colitis: factors affecting prognosis.
PG  - 768-74; discussion 774-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have identified the factors that contribute 
      to the development of antibiotic-associated colitis (AAC), little data are
      available in regard to those factors that may affect the prognosis of patients
      with the disease. Therefore we conducted a retrospective analysis of 201 surgical
      patients with AAC to identify risk factors predictive of increased morbidity or
      mortality. METHODS: We conducted a review of the charts of 201 surgical patients 
      hospitalized between Jan. 1, 1991, and June 30, 1993, in whom AAC developed. AAC 
      was defined as the presence of diarrhea associated with a positive latex
      agglutination or toxin assay for Clostridium difficile. An additional 52
      procedure-matched charts of patients admitted to a surgical service during the
      same period were also reviewed and constituted the control group. We analyzed the
      contribution of 21 variables to prognosis in both groups. RESULTS: There was no
      difference between the two groups in the preoperative length of stay, the number 
      of antibiotics per patient and the number of antibiotic-days, number of patients 
      receiving preoperative bowel preparation, total parenteral nutrition, and overall
      mortality rate. Patients in the control group were at increased risk of death if 
      they had a history of preexisting renal dysfunction, prolonged preoperative
      hospital stay, and a poor nutritional status. AAC developed 10.0 +/- 13.8 days
      after operation in the study group. All patients were receiving multiple
      antibiotics at the time of diagnosis (3.6 +/- 7.5 antibiotic), with a mean of
      14.3 +/- 20.7 antibiotic-days. The overall mortality rate in the study group was 
      8%. In five patients (2%) toxic megacolon developed; four deaths occurred among
      these patients (80% mortality rate). A 25% mortality rate was directly
      attributable to complications of AAC. Six variables were identified as predictive
      of increased mortality rate: steroids, laxatives, length of preoperative stay,
      postoperative interval before the onset of symptoms, use of total parenteral
      nutrition, and abdominal distention. CONCLUSIONS: AAC carries a significant
      mortality rate in surgical patients; therefore the diagnosis of AAC should be
      aggressively pursued and patients with the disease should be promptly treated.
      Patients receiving steroids, total parenteral nutrition, and multiple antibiotics
      in whom signs and symptoms of AAC develop late in their postoperative course, and
      patients with abdominal distention and marked leukocytosis, are at increased risk
      of dying of AAC and should be aggressively treated.

TI  - Management of fulminant ulcerative colitis by primary restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 971-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Severe acute ulcerative colitis unresponsive to medical management is
      characterized by multiple associated risk factors including anemia,
      hypoproteinemia, and high steroid requirements when urgent surgery is required.
      Current surgical options include use of primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
      (IPAA) vs. historic trends favoring colectomy with ileostomy. PURPOSE: To
      evaluate the efficacy of primary IPAA in patients with severe colitis, we
      reviewed our own experience in 20 patients with this condition. METHODS: Patients
      undergoing primary restorative proctocolectomy included 13 males and 7 females
      (mean age, 30.5 +/- 2.4 years). Exclusion criteria for primary reconstruction
      included septic patients and patients with associated medical conditions such as 
      pulmonary or cardiovascular disease. History of ulcerative colitis averaged 3.1
      +/- 1.1 years (range, 1 month to 19 years). Preoperative mean total serum protein
      concentration was 5.0 +/- 0.2 g/dl, and mean albumin concentration was 2.1 +/-
      0.2 g/dl, reflecting disease severity. The average daily steroid requirement at
      the time of urgent colectomy was 58.0 +/- 4.4 mg of prednisone (or intravenous
      equivalent). Primary IPAA included 18 "W" reservoirs, 1 "S" reservoir, and 1 "J" 
      reservoir. RESULTS: Major surgical complications included mild pancreatitis (10
      percent), anastomotic leak (5 percent), adrenal insufficiency (15 percent), an
      upper gastrointestinal bleed (5 percent), and small bowel obstruction (15
      percent). There were no deaths, and no patients developed pelvic sepsis or
      required IPAA removal. At three and twelve months, 24-hr stool frequency averaged
      7.3 +/- 0.4 and 4.9 +/- 0.3, respectively. Overall day and night continence was
      excellent and not different from patients who underwent elective IPAA procedures 
      for ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Improved options such as primary IPAA may be
      safely used in selected patients requiring urgent surgery for severe or fulminant
      ulcerative colitis. Medical management should be abbreviated when disease control
      cannot be promptly achieved.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 547-55
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children and adults remains the most challenging
      problem in gastroenterology. There is an increasing body of immunologic and
      genetic evidence to suggest that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      different diseases, but that once inflammation begins, many common secondary
      pathways of inflammation are initiated. The major recent conceptual advance is
      the observation that mice in whom different immunoregulatory pathways are
      disrupted develop an inflammatory bowel disease. In the case of interleukin-2
      knockout mice, the lesion restricted to the colon, is virtually identical to
      ulcerative colitis in humans, and is initiated by the normal bacterial flora. Yet
      these mice possess anticolon antibodies, long-considered to be of pathologic
      significance in ulcerative colitis. These animal models will allow detailed
      longitudinal studies to be done, and less reliance will need to be placed on
      cross-sectional studies of chronically inflamed gut from patients.

TI  - Platelets in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease express functional
      interleukin-1 and interleukin-8 receptors.
PG  - 656-63
AB  - Tissue and plasma concentrations of several cytokines are increased in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Platelets play an important role in
      inflammation and circulate in an activated state in patients with IBD. This study
      assesses the expression of IL-8 and IL-1 receptors on the surface of platelets
      from patients with IBD using phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled recombinant human rhIL-1
      beta and rhIL-8 and flow cytometry. The percentage IL-1R expressing platelets
      (median and interquartile range IQR) in the IBD group was 8.7% (5.5-18.2)
      compared to 4.2% (2.3-6.1) in controls (P = 0.02). The percentage IL-8R
      expressing platelets in the IBD group was 22.5% (16.5-27.9) and 9.2% (4.3-9.6) in
      controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, platelet IL-1R expression in patients with IBD
      was inversely related to the total daily dose of steroids (r = 0.71, P < 0.01
      linear regression analysis). Finally, platelet rich plasma from healthy controls 
      was stimulated with rhIL-1 beta and rhIL-8 and assessed for activation dependent 
      expression of platelet aGPIIb/IIIa and CD62 (p-selectin, GMP-140). IL-1 beta and 
      IL-8 in vitro significantly and specifically activated the platelets. The surface
      membrane of platelets is able to express functional IL-1R and IL-8R, the
      expression of which is significantly increased in IBD. Interleukin-1 beta and
      IL-8 modulate platelet activation in vitro indicating a target role for platelet 
      function in inflammation.

TI  - Physical health status in young subjects after colectomy: an application of the
      Roy model.
PG  - 500-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the long-term physical health status after 
      colectomy in 30 young subjects with ulcerative colitis, 11 of whom had
      ileostomies. The subjects, aged between 14 and 31 years of age, were assessed
      post-operatively for their physical health status. In assessing physiological
      adaptation in these subjects four basic needs were the foci: nutrition,
      elimination, activity and rest, and protection. Adaptation problems related to
      nutrition, elimination, activity/rest and protection were found in four, 17, 17
      and three subjects respectively. Nine out of 30 had pain that influenced their
      daily life. Six out of 30 subjects had no adaptation problems at all. Nineteen
      subjects found their health to be 'excellent' or 'good' despite the adaptation
      problems reported.

TI  - Current concepts: management of diarrhea in acute care.
PG  - 199-205
AB  - Diarrhea is common in the acute care setting, particularly among critically ill
      patients. Factors that cause diarrhea are usually multifactorial; some of the
      most common include medications, hyperosmolar or rapidly delivered tube feedings,
      atrophy of intestinal epithelium or ischemic bowel, short bowel syndrome,
      pseudomembranous colitis, infection (Salmonella and Shigella species),
      opportunistic infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 
      severe hypoproteinemia. This article reviews different types and mechanisms of
      diarrhea commonly encountered in acute care. It includes current concepts of
      managing diarrhea, such as calculation of stool osmotic gap, identification of
      medications that cause diarrhea, modification of enteral therapy, and the use of 
      antisecretory agents. Nursing responsibilities and contributions in the
      collaborative assessment and clinical management of diarrhea are also explored.

TI  - Intractable infant diarrhea associated with phenotypic abnormalities and
      immunodeficiency.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - We report on eight children with severe diarrhea beginning in the first 6 months 
      of life (< 1 month in six cases), who had a number of features in common. All
      were small for gestational age and had an abnormal phenotype, including facial
      dysmorphism, hypertelorism, and woolly, easily removable hair with trichorhexis
      nodosa. Two were products of consanguineous marriages. Severe secretory diarrhea 
      persisted despite bowel rest (n = 7). Jejunal biopsy specimens showed total or
      subtotal villous atrophy with crypt necrosis, and inconstant T-cell activation in
      some cases (n = 3). Colon biopsy specimens showed moderate nonspecific colitis.
      All the patients had defective antibody responses despite normal serum
      immunoglobulin levels, and defective antigen-specific skin tests despite positive
      proliferative responses in vitro. Three had monoclonal hyper-immunoglobulinemia
      A. The course was marked by diffuse erythroderma in two cases and mental
      retardation in three. Treatment included bowel rest, intravenous administration
      of immune globulins, administration of corticosteroids (n = 6) and cyclosporine
      (n = 2), and bone marrow transplantation (n = 1). Five patients died between the 
      ages of 2 and 5 years (of sepsis or cirrhosis), two are being fed enterally, and 
      one continues to receive total parenteral nutrition. The cause of the combined
      low birth weight, dysmorphism, severe diarrhea, trichorrhexis, and
      immunodeficiency is unclear. These features may constitute a specific syndrome
      within the group of intractable diarrheas of infancy.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha-producing cells in the intestinal mucosa of children 
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1455-66
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cytokines are thought to be important in mediating tissue damage
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many of the in vivo activities of tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) match the changes found in IBD, but its
      importance is controversial. METHODS: A sensitive, reverse hemolytic plaque assay
      was used to determine the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells isolated from
      mucosal biopsy specimens of children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
      (UC) and non-IBD controls before and after medical treatment. RESULTS: Frequency 
      of TNF-alpha secreting cells was significantly increased in biopsy specimens from
      children with mild, nonspecific inflammation compared with those with
      histologically normal intestine. Frequency did not increase in UC compared with
      children with nonspecific inflammation but was significantly greater in Crohn's
      disease than in UC. After treatment, the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells
      was reduced in patients receiving cyclosporin A, not reduced in patients with
      steroids or enteral nutrition, and not changed with treatment in UC. CONCLUSIONS:
      TNF-alpha secreting cells are increased in the mucosa of inflamed intestine,
      regardless of pathogenesis. In patients with IBD, higher levels are seen in
      Crohn's disease than in UC, probably reflecting the extensive T-cell activation
      in Crohn's disease. No relation existed between histological healing and the
      frequency of TNF-alpha-secreting cells.

AB  - One-hundred-twenty infants under 1 year of age suffering from intractable
      diarrhoea were studied. They had received prior treatment in the form of
      antimicrobials (100 per cent), stool binding substance (50 percent), antimotility
      agents (50 per cent), and intravenous (IV) fluids (33 per cent). One-third of
      them had been hospitalised in peripheral hospitals. All of them had diarrhoea of 
      more than 2 weeks' duration, protein energy malnutrition and were very ill. In
      addition vomiting, dehydration, fever, paralytic ileus, perianal excoriation and 
      rectal prolapse were present in 44, 23, 33, 9, 47, and 3 per cent of the infants,
      respectively. Anaemia, multiple vitamin deficiencies, and pedal oedema were seen 
      in 70, 10, and 3 per cent of infants, respectively. The infections documented
      were septicaemia (22 per cent), bronchopneumonia (6 per cent), meningitis (4 per 
      cent), urinary tract infection (3 per cent) and acute supporative otitis media in
      2 per cent of infants. Fifty-three per cent of infants had secondary lactose
      intolerance. Intolerance to milk protein, milk protein and soyabean and milk
      protein, as well as soyabean and chicken was seen in 4, 2, and 1 per cent cases, 
      respectively. Aetiological agents isolated from stool culture were E. coli, (18
      per cent), Klebsiella species (9 per cent), Shigella species (6 per cent),
      Salmonella typhimurium (2 per cent), Cholera mitschikom (1 per cent), Giardia
      lamblia (6 per cent), cryptosporidium (1 per cent), and E. histolytica (1 per
      cent). Candida albicans was grown in 18 per cent of infants. Pseudomembranous
      colitis was documented in 2 per cent cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Follow-up of colorectal cancers].
PG  - 468-71
AB  - Recurrence of colorectal carcinoma after curative surgery amounts to 30-40%. It
      is more frequent with deep penetration of the cancer, in young or old patients
      and in high risk groups. Familial polyposis, ulcerative colitis, Lynch's
      syndromes, and past history of adenoma or cancer are the best examples. The
      follow-up is effective if strict protocols are used, with frequent examinations. 
      However, they are costly in comparison with results. Colonoscopy is essential for
      surveillance of the large bowel. Clinical evaluation, ultrasonography and CEA are
      useful for extra-colonic deposits.

TI  - Childhood infections and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 555-60
AB  - Adults with inflammatory bowel disease from North Carolina were questioned during
      1986 and 1987 to assess risk due to a variety of childhood infections and
      treatments with antibiotics. Responses were compared with those of neighbor
      controls. Persons with Crohn's disease were more likely to report an increased
      frequency of childhood infections in general (odds ratio 4.67, 95% CI 2.65-8.23) 
      and pharyngitis specifically (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.51). This was
      validated by an increased frequency of tonsillectomy (odds ratio 1.53, 95% CI
      1.07-2.20). Crohn's cases were more likely to report frequent treatment with
      antibiotics for both otitis (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.03-4.14) and pharyngitis
      (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.20-3.84). Although Crohn's cases were more likely to
      report frequent exposure to penicillin (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.98-3.31), there
      did not appear to be excess risk conferred by penicillin after controlling for
      frequency of infections. Persons with ulcerative colitis also reported an excess 
      of infections generally (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.19-4.71), but not an excess of
      specific infections or treatments with antibiotics. Persons who reported an
      increased frequency of infections tended to have an earlier onset of Crohn's
      disease (P < 0.0001) and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.04). Finally, it was noted
      that urban living in childhood increased the risk for Crohn's disease. We
      conclude that childhood infections may be a risk factor for Crohn's disease and
      may presage the early onset of disease.

TI  - Surgical therapy of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 149-80
AB  - The overall impression gained from the experience of the Departments of
      Paediatric Gastroenterology and Surgery attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital are
      the enormous benefits that surgery has to confer on the large percentage of
      children with both Crohn's disease and idiopathic proctocolitis who require it.
      The surgical procedures described in this chapter have been accompanied by a
      remarkably low complication rate, dispelling the impression that morbidity in
      such cases would be high. This must in large measure be due to the fact that the 
      children who come to surgery are in as good a state of nutrition as can be
      achieved by means of the various forms of enteral and parenteral feeding now
      available. Anxiety about healing of anastomoses and the development of fistulas
      after surgery for example, has not been a feature of the surgical care of these
      patients. The principal benefit of surgery has been a clear demonstration of an
      improvement in growth velocity in both Crohn's disease and idiopathic
      proctocolitis patients provided always that surgery is correctly timed. It is the
      author's experience that maximum benefit is achieved if the bulk of the diseased 
      bowel can be removed. Plainly relief of symptoms such as abdominal pain and
      diarrhoea has also been rewarding. In many instances second procedures such as
      restorative proctectomy in idiopathic proctocolitis can be timed to fit in with
      educational commitments. In Crohn's disease the likelihood of recurrence in adult
      life is high but these patients are in a fit state to cope with further therapy
      including surgery should the need arise. From the management point of view the
      close cooperation between physicians and surgeons at all stages has been crucial,
      firstly to achieve smooth preparation prior to surgery and satisfactory after
      care. But of even more importance in the assessment of Crohn's disease is the
      presence of all clinicians involved in the case in the operating theatre so that 
      the surgical options are fully assessed. This united approach avoids any
      unnecessary anxiety when, as inevitably happens, recurrence of symptoms due to
      relapse occurs. The involvement of patients of whatever age, and parents in all
      the decision making processes from the time of diagnosis has been vital. Early
      discussion about stomas involving members of the Stomatherapy Department has been
      invaluable. One final important aspect of the management of these patients is the
      seamless hand-over of care to an adult combined medical and surgical clinic at an
      appropriate time, usually at the age of 17 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Medical management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 133-48
AB  - In the absence of a definitive cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,
      the aim of therapy must be to induce and maintain clinical remission at
      acceptable cost to the patient in terms of adverse effects. Despite the
      differences in their pathogenesis, the first-line treatments for Crohn's disease 
      and ulcerative colitis are still based upon combinations of amino-salicylic acid 
      derivatives and corticosteroids, although the use of enteral nutrition regimes is
      becoming increasingly widespread in Crohn's disease. In this chapter we attempt
      to provide reasonably didactic guidance for the management of most cases of
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, we have tried to go beyond this
      brief, motivated by the recent explosion in knowledge of inflammatory mechanisms,
      to suggest a rational approach to the choice of newer and less well tested
      therapeutic approaches in the affected child who is not responding effectively.
      The relative failure of cyclosporine therapy in Crohn's disease has been
      particularly disappointing in view of its ideal theoretical suitability. However,
      the encouraging early reports of treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-TNF alpha
      monoclonals suggest that the shift from broad spectrum immunomodulation to the
      targeting of critical components of the inflammatory cascade may yet field
      important dividends.

TI  - Fecal short-chain fatty acids in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - Nutrition of colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes) is maintained by luminal
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), chiefly by n-butyrate. The importance of SCFAs
      for the maintenance of colonic epithelium has been demonstrated in animal models 
      of colitis produced by rectal instillation of an inhibitor of SCFA oxidation and 
      in patients with diversion colitis in whom a segment of colonic epithelium was
      deprived of contact with luminal SCFAs. We measured fecal SCFAs and lactate in
      children with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 17) and with Crohn's disease with
      ileocolonic involvement (CD; n = 22) and age-matched controls (n = 12) by a
      vacuum-distillation, gas chromatographic method. Fecal SCFA concentrations were
      correlated with scores of clinical disease activity. Patients with UC and CD had 
      a decrease in the fecal concentration of acetate (p < 0.05) and an increase in
      n-butyrate (p < 0.01) compared with controls. No significant changes in fecal
      lactate were seen. A comparison of inactive- or mild-UC patients with moderate or
      severe-UC patients yielded major differences in SCFA concentrations with
      n-butyrate increased in inactive and mild UC well above control values and total 
      SCFA and acetate decreased in moderate and severe UC below control levels. Raised
      concentrations of fecal n-butyrate may reflect impaired utilization of this SCFA 
      in the colon of patients with mild UC and Crohn's disease with colonic
      involvement. Whether this defect is primary or secondary to inhibitors in the
      colonic lumen, due to impaired transport of n-butyrate into the cell or defective
      metabolism within the cell, or specific to inflammatory bowel disease remains to 
      be explored.

AB  - After failure of medical therapy, children with refractory inflammatory bowel
      disease may require surgical intervention. In this article the authors describe
      one child in whom, after traditional therapies for refractory ulcerative colitis 
      failed, full remission of the disease occurred after the addition of
      6-mercaptopurine and cyclosporine A to her medical regimen. 6-Mercaptopurine has 
      been used with increasing frequency in refractory inflammatory bowel disease; the
      use of cyclosporine A for this condition is still under investigation.

      acute, severe ulcerative colitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of metronidazole and
      tobramycin as an adjunct to corticosteroids in acute, severe ulcerative colitis. 
      METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with severe ulcerative colitis were
      randomized on admission to the hospital to receive intravenously either
      metronidazole (0.5g tid) and tobramycin (4 mg/kg tid) (n = 19), or placebo (n =
      20). In addition, they were given parenteral nutrition, intravenous
      hydrocortisone (100 mg qid) and hydrocortisone enemas (100 mg bid). All patients 
      were assessed after 10 days of continuous treatment, or at any time a severe
      complication occurred. RESULTS: Twelve of 19 patients (63.15%) treated with
      antibiotics and 13/20 patients (65%) with placebo showed substantial improvement.
      Seven patients in each group did not improve (n = 9), or developed complications 
      (n = 5) and underwent emergency colectomy without perioperative deaths or late
      deaths. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the routine use of intravenous 
      tobramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Dilatation of the colon complicating acute self-limited colitis.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - Colonic dilatation has been reported as an occasional complication of infectious 
      colitis in single case reports and short series, but no large series has been
      published. We analysed 19 cases of self-limited colitis complicated by colonic
      dilatation, with infective agents identified in 14, admitted to a Regional
      Infectious Diseases Unit. Colonic dilatation, defined as a minimum transverse
      colonic diameter of 7 cm on plain abdominal X-ray, was associated with
      approximately 1% of cases of notifiable diarrhoea requiring hospital admission.
      The clinical course was associated with pyrexia (in 90%), tachycardia (in 90%),
      hypoalbuminaemia (in 100%), anaemia (in 84%) and reactive thrombocytosis (in
      63%). There was a history of antidiarrhoeal agents or opiate analgesia in
      eighteen patients (95%). Intensive medical management, consisting of intravenous 
      antibiotics, steroids, supplementary nutrition and withdrawal of anti-motility
      agents, resulted in resolution in 17 patients. Two patients required subtotal
      colectomy for perforation of the transverse colon, but neither developed severe
      peritonitis, and both subsequently underwent reversal of ileostomy. With early
      recognition and close observation of colonic dilatation in patients with acute
      diarrhoea, most cases can be successfully managed conservatively with
      preservation of the colon. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients
      with progressive colonic dilatation despite intensive medical management. There
      were no clinically useful parameters distinguishing self-limited colitis from
      inflammatory bowel disease acutely, so initial management should cover both
      possibilities.

TI  - Effects of short chain fatty acids on gut morphology and function.
PG  - S35-8
AB  - Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the products of colonic bacterial degradation
      of unabsorbed starch and non-starch polysaccharide (fibre). They are important
      anions in the colonic lumen, affecting both colonocyte morphology and function.
      The three main acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) stimulate colonic sodium
      and fluid absorption and exert proliferative effects on the colonocyte.
      Experimental animal studies have shown that they promote adaptive responses to
      small intestinal resection and colonic anastomosis. Acetate increases colonic
      blood flow and enhances ileal motility. Butyrate has been shown to be the
      preferred energy substrate for the colonocyte and to be a potent differentiating 
      agent in cell culture. Butyrate may also have a role in preventing certain types 
      of colitis. A diet low in resistant starch and fibre, which will result in a low 
      production of SCFAs in the colon, may explain the high occurrence of colonic
      disorders seen in the Western civilization.

AB  - A 60-year-old lady with type II diabetes, arterial hypertension and 'melancholia'
      was treated with Lithium, a neuroleptic (Leponex) and an ACE inhibitor (Reniten).
      She was referred to our hospital because of abdominal pain, subfebrile
      temperatures, diarrhea and hematochezia. The radiological and sonographic
      examinations showed a thickened wall of the left hemicolon. Colonoscopy revealed 
      a sharply delineated segment with pronounced inflammation in the descending colon
      and the proximal sigmoid colon, suggestive for an ischemic colitis. Histology of 
      the inflamed colon was compatible with this diagnosis. Under suspended enteral
      feeding and antibiotic therapy the symptoms disappeared within two weeks, and a
      control colonoscopy six weeks later was completely normal. 1 1/2 years later the 
      patient suffered from a second episode of ischemic colitis exactly a the same
      site. Again, complete cure was achieved by conservative treatment.

AB  - We report two young men with clinical and laboratory evidence of macroscopic
      ulcerative colitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus. The first patient presented at age 15 with vomiting, abdominal pain,
      weight loss, and abnormal liver function test results. Liver biopsy and
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated sclerosing
      cholangitis. Colonoscopy with biopsy revealed ulcerative colitis which responded 
      to sulfasalazine. Diabetes occurred at age 18 and insulin therapy was begun. The 
      second patient was 19 at presentation with diarrhea, hematochezia, and weight
      loss. Proctosigmoidoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis, and sulfasalazine led to
      clinical remission. Three months later he developed diabetes requiring insulin
      therapy. At age 28, he developed elevated alkaline phosphatase, and ERCP revealed
      sclerosing cholangitis. At age 37 he expired from adenocarcinoma that
      metastasized to the liver. Literature review revealed only one possible case
      report of this association with microscopic asymptomatic ulcerative colitis in
      that patient. Statistical analysis suggests that this association is real rather 
      than a chance occurrence. An autoimmune process may be involved and a specific
      histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) type may exert a regulatory influence.

TI  - Growth failure in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective study.
PG  - 681-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth failure frequently complicates the clinical course of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. This study was designed to
      investigate the role of disease activity versus steroid therapy on growth
      faltering in this disorder. METHODS: We studied growth failure and its
      relationship to disease activity and steroid therapy in 69 children who have IBD 
      by prospectively monitoring height for a maximum of 3 years. Disease activity and
      steroid use were recorded at entry into the study. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      growth failure was 24%, 23%, and 39% by height velocity, Z score, and
      height-for-age criteria, respectively; deficits were equally prevalent regardless
      of the stage of pubertal development. A delay in linear growth persisted
      throughout puberty and was not reversed after surgery. Patients who had Crohn's
      disease were twice as likely to have growth abnormalities than patients who had
      ulcerative colitis. We detected significant negative associations between linear 
      growth and disease activity but not steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a unique
      group of children, growth failure is an early, "prepatterned" manifestation of
      IBD. The inflammatory process, rather than steroid use, has a predominant
      influence on the development of growth faltering.

TI  - [The short-bowel syndrome].
PG  - 468-72
AB  - This study was designed to asses the clinical course of five children with a
      short bowel syndrome after massive intestinal resection during neonatal period.
      On the basis of their experience the authors analyze some properties that may be 
      advantageous in this syndrome and discuss the most important factors, including
      enteral feeding at an early postresection stage, which influence a full
      development of the small bowel adaptive mechanisms. They point out that so called
      "short gut colitis", sometimes occurring during advancement of enteral nutrition,
      can be successfully treated by sulphasalazine. The authors come to the conclusion
      that the prognosis for newborn infants undergoing an excessive bowel resection is
      far well thanks to enhancement of the intestinal adaptation by a combination of a
      long-term parenteral nutrition with enteral feeding.

AB  - Medical records concerning pediatric or adolescent patients first diagnosed with 
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in two New York hospitals during a 5-year
      period (1986 to 1990) were abstracted, and information concerning sex, age, race,
      birthplace, sibship size, birth order, maternal age at birth, month of birth,
      duration of breast-feeding, and maternal smoking was recorded. Medical records of
      patients presenting at the respective pediatric gastroenterology departments
      immediately before or after the patients with inflammatory bowel disease were
      seen were also abstracted in order to generate a control series. Data concerning 
      68 patients with Crohn's disease, 39 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 202
      control patients were analyzed through multiple logistic regression.
      Breast-feeding was negatively associated with Crohn's disease (P approximately
      0.04) and ulcerative colitis (P approximately 0.07), with relative risk point
      estimates around 0.5 and with evidence of duration-dependent trends in both
      instances. There was no evidence of association of either disease with maternal
      age at birth, birth order, maternal smoking, or season of birth.

AB  - Six severe and 7 moderately severe ulcerative colitis patients were treated by
      pulsed steroid therapy. For one course of the therapy, either 0.5 or 1 gram of
      hydrocortisone-21 sodium succinate or methylprednisolone sodium succinate was
      given once a day intravenously for 3 consecutive days, following 4 days with no
      infusion. The patients were treated for 3 to 6 courses. Ten patients entered
      clinical remission, 1 patient improved, and therapy failed for 2 patients. Judged
      endoscopically, 5 patients achieved remission. Six patients improved and 2
      patients did not improve. Severe side effect was not noted as to stop the
      medication. One patient had hyperglycemia for a few days after the start of the
      first course, this patient received total parenteral nutrition. Three patients
      showed moon face. Steroid withdrawal syndrome did not develop.

TI  - Saccharomyces boulardii for Clostridium difficile-associated enteropathies in
      infants.
PG  - 419-25
AB  - Based on experimental evidence in animals showing that the oral administration of
      Saccharomyces boulardii is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality due to
      Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis, we conducted an open
      trial to examine the effects of the living yeast, given as primary therapy, in a 
      selected group of infants and children with persistent intestinal symptoms
      related to toxinogenic C. difficile overgrowth. Over a period of 10 consecutive
      months, we studied 19 eligible patients (median age 8 months) who presented with 
      enteral symptoms lasting for > 15 days and who had solely C. difficile in stools 
      with positive cytotoxin B assay. Serotyping of the strains and determination in
      vitro of production of toxins A and B were performed subsequently. The patients
      presented with persistent or protracted diarrhea, malabsorption, and failure to
      grow (n = 8), or with repeated attacks of colics, emesis, and hypermeteorism
      without diarrhea (n = 4), or with both entities (n = 7). Patients with chronic
      protracted diarrhea (n = 3) had depressed jejunal disaccharidase activities and
      ultrastructural changes of enterocytes, including sparce and shortened
      microvilli. None had evidence of colitis. All the strains of C. difficile tested 
      (n = 17) belonged to pathogenic serotypes (A1, A8, C, F, G, H, and K) and
      produced in vitro high levels of toxins A (n = 16) and B (n = 17). S. boulardii
      was given orally in a lyophilized form over 15 days (250 mg two to four times per
      day according to age).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Growth failure in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - To assess whether children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop
      permanent impairment of linear growth, we analyzed records from 48 young adults
      who had IBD during childhood or early adolescence (Tanner I-III; 11.8 +/- 2.4
      years old at diagnosis). All were fully grown (Tanner V; 21.1 +/- 3.0 years) at
      last examination. Adult heights were predicted from data obtained at or shortly
      after the diagnosis of IBD by three methods: height for age percentile, the
      Bailey-Pinneau (BP), and Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT) methods. Predicted adult
      heights were then compared with the actual ultimate height of each subject.
      Permanent growth failure occurred in 19-35% of subjects, depending upon the
      method used to assess growth. Overall, 31% (15 of 48) of the subjects had
      deficits of adult height identified by two or more methods, including 14 of 38
      (37%) of those with Crohn's disease but only one of 10 with ulcerative colitis.
      Age at diagnosis of IBD, age at last examination, age at cessation of linear
      growth, and site of IBD did not differ between impaired and normal growth groups.
      Duration of corticosteroid use was longer (p < 0.05) in growth-impaired subjects.
      In addition, although 60% of all subjects had periods of poor growth that put
      them in height-for-age percentiles two or more major growth channels below
      previous percentiles, only 19% remained at these levels upon achieving their
      final adult heights. Permanent impairment of linear growth leading to clinically 
      meaningful deficits of ultimate adult height is common in patients with IBD in
      childhood or early adolescence. New therapeutic approaches are needed to address 
      this problem.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis and total alopecia in a mother and her son.
PG  - 1187-91
AB  - Extraintestinal autoimmune disorders are associated with ulcerative colitis in
      selected patients and lend support to the theory of immune-mediated injury in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Rarely, alopecia areata has been associated with
      ulcerative colitis, and familial aggregation and an HLA association have been
      reported for both disorders. The occurrence of both alopecia and ulcerative
      colitis in a mother and son are reported with a detailed investigation of
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and HLA alleles in this family. Treatment
      with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine proved beneficial in the child
      leading to remission of the ulcerative colitis and nascent growth of scalp and
      body hair.

TI  - Reducing sulfur compounds of the colon impair colonocyte nutrition: implications 
      for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 802-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mercaptides (sodium hydrogen sulfide and sodium methanethiol) and
      mercapto-fatty acid (sodium mercaptoacetate) are reducing agents that help to
      maintain anaerobic conditions in the colonic lumen. The metabolic effect of these
      agents on n-butyrate and glucose oxidation in human colonocytes is unknown.
      METHODS: Isolated human colonocytes were prepared from 31 colectomy specimens,
      and generation of oxidative metabolites from [1-14C]n-butyrate and [6-14C]glucose
      was measured in the presence and absence of reducing agents. Injury to cells was 
      judged by diminished production of metabolites. RESULTS: The injurious action of 
      mercaptides at all sites of the colon was of the order of sodium hydrogen sulfide
      > methanethiol > mercaptoacetate. Significant inhibition of n-butyrate (< 0.005) 
      but not glucose oxidation was observed with sodium hydrogen sulfide in the
      ascending colon, splenic flexure, and rectosigmoid region. Hydrogen sulfide more 
      significantly inhibited fatty acid oxidation in the rectosigmoid than in the
      ascending colon (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic effects of sodium hydrogen
      sulfide on butyrate oxidation along the length of the colon closely mirror
      metabolic abnormalities observed in active ulcerative colitis, and the increased 
      production of sulfide in ulcerative colitis suggests that the action of
      mercaptides may be involved in the genesis of ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Collagenous colitis, a disorder characterized by increased subepithelial collagen
      deposition associated with an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, has 
      been reported infrequently in children. An 8-year-old girl with collagenous
      colitis is described who presented with chronic watery diarrhea and abdominal
      pain. Biopsy specimens of the colonic mucosa showed the pathological features of 
      collagenous colitis. The patient's symptoms resolved following corticosteroid
      therapy. Collagenous colitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis
      of children with chronic diarrhea.

TI  - Enteral versus parenteral nutrition as adjunct therapy in acute ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 227-32
AB  - To ascertain the role of total enteral nutrition, compared with total parenteral 
      nutrition, as adjunct therapy to steroids in patients with severe acute
      ulcerative colitis, a prospective randomized trial was conducted in 42 of such
      patients. Inclusion criteria were the persistence of a moderate or severe attack 
      of the disease (Truelove's index) after 48 h on full steroid treatment
      (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day). Patients were randomized to receive polymeric total
      enteral nutrition or isocaloric, isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition as the
      sole nutritional support. Remission rate and need for colectomy were similar in
      both groups. No significant changes in anthropometric parameters were observed in
      either nutritional group at the end of the study. Median increase in serum
      albumin was 16.7% (-0.5% to +30.4%) in the enteral feeding group, and only 4.6%
      (-12.0% to +13.7%) in the parenteral nutrition patients (p = 0.019). Adverse
      effects related to artificial nutritional support were less frequent (9% vs. 35%,
      p = 0.046) and milder in enterally fed patients. Postoperative infections
      occurred more often with parenteral nutrition (p = 0.028). These results suggest 
      that total enteral nutrition is safe and nutritionally effective in severe
      attacks of ulcerative colitis. It is also cheaper and associated with fewer
      complications than parenteral nutrition. Total enteral nutrition should be
      regarded as the most suitable type of nutritional support in these patients.

TI  - [The risk of extra-colonic extension in Crohn's colitis].
PG  - 1-10
AB  - One hundred and two patients with Crohn's colitis present on average for 8 years,
      were studied retrospectively in order to determine whether or not a group of
      patients existed in whom the disease remained limited to the colon, and if such a
      group could be identified early on in the course of the disorder. At the time of 
      the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, 34 patients had a concomitant anoperineal
      lesion, while 68 had disease affecting the colon only. In the latter, at the end 
      of the follow-up period, the disease remained exclusively limited to the colon in
      39 cases (57 p. cent). The actuarial rate of non-extra-colonic spread was 75, 40 
      and 35 p. cent at 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. Spread involved above all the 
      anoperineal region (55 p. cent at 10 years), and less often the ileum (20 p. cent
      at 10 years). In patients monitored for at least 6 years, there was no
      significant difference between those in whom disease had spread and those in whom
      it remained limited to the colon, regarding the main initial clinical findings by
      history and examination, the same applying after the disease had been present for
      3 years. These results would go against the existence of a specific entity of
      "Crohn's disease affecting the colon as an organ" and support the opinion that
      coloproctectomy with a pouch should be avoided in colitis due to Crohn's disease.

TI  - Immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: results of a
      survey of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and
      Nutrition. Subcommittee on Immunosuppressive Use of the Pediatric IBD
      Collaborative Research Forum.
PG  - 44-8
AB  - We report the results of a survey of the membership of the North American Society
      for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition designed to determine pediatric
      gastroenterologists' attitudes toward the use of immunosuppressive therapy for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to assess how these medications are
      actually being used in the treatment of children with IBD. One hundred five
      physicians (27% of surveys) responded. Eighty-eight (84%) had prescribed
      6-mercaptopurine and/or azathioprine for IBD, and 66 believed that they were
      effective. Only 12 had used cyclosporine and four methotrexate. All physicians
      who had used immunosuppressives in IBD had prescribed them for patients with
      Crohn's disease, but only 50% had prescribed them for ulcerative colitis. The
      predominant indications for use included intractable symptoms despite traditional
      medical therapy (92%) and for corticosteroid-sparing effects (86%). Potential
      toxicities of greatest concern included marrow and immune suppression and
      malignancy. The vast majority of responders were not certain what to recommend
      with respect to the use of immunosuppressive agents prior to and during
      pregnancy. A clinical database was compiled from 165 retrospective case reports
      submitted by 45 physicians (33 medical facilities). At the start of
      immunosuppressive therapy, patients were 15.3 +/- 4.0 yr of age, and 52% were
      Tanner IV-V. Eighty-one percent had Crohn's disease, 8% ulcerative colitis, and
      11% indeterminant colitis. One hundred twenty-two were treated with
      6-mercaptopurine, and 43 with azathioprine. Five also received cyclosporine
      concomitantly. Overall, 68% of patients treated with an immunosuppressive
      improved. Complications requiring discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy
      occurred in 6% of patients. It appears that immunosuppressives are commonly used 
      to treat children with IBD despite a paucity of data regarding their safety and
      efficacy in this age group. Controlled, prospective trials are warranted to
      better define the role of immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric IBD.

PG  - 718-22
AB  - An increased degradation of colonic mucus by bacterial enzymes might participate 
      in the development of mucosal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease. The
      biodisponibility of drugs used in the treatment of such disease relies upon the
      metabolic activity of colonic bacterial flora. This activity can be indirectly
      assessed by measuring fecal enzymatic activities. The aim of this study was to
      compare fecal beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity in controls, in patients
      suffering from extradigestive inflammatory disease and in patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD). Three groups were studied including 11 healthy volunteers (6 F, 5
      M) mean age 29 years (21-37), 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (17 F, 3
      M), mean age 61.5 years, and 34 patients with non operated CD (21 F, 13 M) mean
      age: 27 years (13-50). The Crohn disease activity index (CDAI) was > 150 in 24
      and < 150 in 10. beta-gal activity was measured in fecal extracts by its ability 
      to hydrolyze paranitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside and expressed as units of
      enzymatic activity/gram of fecal proteins. beta-gal activity was significantly
      decreased in patients with CD (16 +/- 4.5 U/g) (m +/- sem) as compared with
      patients with RA (353 +/- 64 U/g) (P < 0.0001) and to controls (263 +/- 40 U/g)
      (P = 0.002). beta-gal activity was not significantly different in controls and in
      patients with RA. Patients with active CD had a significantly lower beta-gal
      activity than patients with quiescent CD (9.5 +/- 3.7 U/g vs 31.4 +/- 11.5 U/g)
      (P = 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Frequency of colectomy for ulcerative colitis seems to have increased in some
      referral centers since the introduction of sphincter saving operations. Within
      the 5 years after occurrence of these new techniques, time between diagnosis and 
      colectomy has shortened, emergency colectomies have decreased and patients
      operated on for resistance to treatment were more frequent. These trends reflect 
      a tendency of patients and doctors toward earlier surgery, now that
      sphincter-saving techniques are available.

PG  - 139-47
AB  - Increased immunoglobulin G2 [IgG2] in Crohn's disease in contrast with increased 
      IgG1 in ulcerative colitis was reported in literature data. The aim of our study 
      has been focused on serum IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with resected bowel
      (11 patients) and without previous surgery for Crohn's disease (12 patients). All
      patients were in active stage of the disease on total parenteral nutrition. Serum
      IgG subclasses were estimated by means of radial immunodiffusion. There was no
      significant differences between in IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with and
      without bowel resection. IgG2 over 4.5 g/l was found only in 2/12 with resected
      bowel and 1/11 without previous surgery for Crohn's disease. Surprisingly,
      IgG1/IgG2 ratio below 1.5 was found only in 5/23 persons. In 3/23 patients IgG1
      was over 10.5 g/l although there was no doubt about the diagnosis of Crohn's
      disease. IgG subclasses failed to help in confirmation of the diagnosis of
      Crohn's disease. Serum IgG subclasses alterations probably are not influenced by 
      bowel resection and/or nutritional status.

PG  - 70-83
AB  - The aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease remains unknown. While
      this remains so, treatment must be directed towards pathogenetic mechanisms.
      Corticosteroids, sulphasalazine and the new salicylates, the immunosuppressants
      azathioprine, 6-MP and, more recently, cyclosporin and metronidazole have become 
      the accepted and standard forms of treatment. The importance of maintaining
      nutritional status is often overlooked but must be considered in every patient.
      Recognition of the occurrence of disease in all age groups, and in particular in 
      children and adolescents, is also important, as is an appreciation of the special
      problems involved. The possibility of surgery at some stage of the disease should
      be raised with the patient. As the pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel 
      disease are further elucidated, new forms of treatment will be developed. This is
      already happening, with studies looking at such agents as immunoglobulin G,
      eicosapentaenoic acid and a new specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. These offer
      hope of more potent drugs with low side-effect profiles that may complement or
      replace the currently available agents used in the management of inflammatory
      bowel disease.
