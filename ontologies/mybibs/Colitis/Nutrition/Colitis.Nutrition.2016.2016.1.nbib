AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase)
      domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's
      disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with
      concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and
      anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating
      LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in
      human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory
      mechanisms driving such expression. METHODS: We implemented Western blot,
      quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry
      analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1
      encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant 
      human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially
      investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA
      knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion
      on peroxisome function. RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in
      macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in
      neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
      among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively
      confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle
      endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes
      involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling
      pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model
      systems. CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary
      role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may 
      be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms 
      through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be
      elucidated.

TI  - Altered expression of Butyrophilin (BTN) and BTN-like (BTNL) genes in intestinal 
      inflammation and colon cancer.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - Several Butyrophilin (BTN) and Btn-like (BTNL) molecules control T lymphocyte
      responses, and are genetically associated with inflammatory disorders and cancer.
      In this study, we present a comprehensive expression analysis of human and murine
      BTN and BTNL genes in conditions associated with intestinal inflammation and
      cancer. Using real-time PCR, expression of human BTN and BTNL genes was analyzed 
      in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and
      colon tumors. Expression of murine Btn and Btnl genes was examined in mouse
      models of spontaneous colitis (Muc2(-/-)) and intestinal tumorigenesis
      (Apc(Min/+)). Our analysis indicates a strong association of several of the human
      genes with ulcerative colitis and colon cancer; while especially BTN1A1, BTN2A2, 
      BTN3A3, and BTNL8 were significantly altered in inflammation, colonic tumors
      exhibited significantly decreased levels of BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 as
      compared to unaffected tissue. Colonic inflammation in Muc2(-/-) mice
      significantly down-regulated the expression of particularly Btnl1, Btnl4, and
      Btnl6 mRNA, and intestinal polyps derived from Apc(Min/+) mice displayed altered 
      levels of Btn1a1, Btn2a2, and Btnl1 transcripts. Thus, our data present an
      association of BTN and BTNL genes with intestinal inflammation and cancer and
      represent a valuable resource for further studies of this gene family.

TI  - Assessment of induction therapy with infliximab in children with moderate to
      severe ulcerative colitis: a multi-center study.
PG  - 205-211
AB  - THE AIM OF THE STUDY: Assessment of clinical and endoscopic efficacy of induction
      therapy with infliximab in children with ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of medical records of pediatric
      patients with moderate to severe UC who had received at least one infusion of
      infliximab in Polish pediatric academic clinical centers from 2003 to 2013. The
      primary endpoint was clinical remission rate at week 10, (PUCAI score <10 points)
      while the secondary endpoints were: clinical response rate (>19-points decrease
      in PUCAI), mucosal response rate (defined as an improvement of the Baron score), 
      and mucosal healing rate (Baron score 0 or 1). RESULTS: 44 patients, at mean age 
      of 14+/-3.9 years, were included into the study. 38 (86%) patients completed
      induction therapy regimen with infliximab and were finally included into the
      analysis. Clinical response and remission rates at week 10 there were 36% and 25%
      respectively. There was significant drop of PUCAI (58.31+/-15.5 vs.
      24.23+/-23.83) and Baron score (2.63+/-0.49 vs. 1.44+/-0.99) at this time point. 
      Mucosal response and mucosal healing rate were 57% and 48% respectively.
      Infliximab failure defined as non-clinical and non-mucosal response at week 10,
      occurred in 16 patients. Infliximab-associated adverse events occurred in 3
      patients, with all severe hypersensitivity reactions to infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Infliximab induction therapy was safe and effective in Polish moderate to severe 
      UC pediatric patients with 50% rate of mucosal improvement. However, clinical
      response rate was lower than previously reported.

TI  - Autonomic nervous system function predicts the inflammatory response over three
      years in newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 1655-1662
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulates intestinal inflammation 
      in animal models. Human evidence confirming such modulating influence is limited.
      We aimed to investigate whether ANS function is associated with inflammatory
      parameters at disease onset, and whether it predicts the evolution of
      inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We prospectively 
      monitored 51 patients from onset of UC for 3 years. Upon remission of the onset
      flare, ANS activity was assessed by heart rate variability analysis and compared 
      with healthy controls. Inflammatory parameters in blood, stool, and colonic
      biopsies obtained at onset and during follow-up visits were analyzed. Generalized
      linear models were used to test cross-sectional associations between ANS activity
      and inflammatory parameters at onset; linear mixed models were used to test
      whether ANS function at onset predicted the evolution of inflammation over the
      following 3 years. KEY RESULTS: Sympathovagal balance was different in UC
      patients compared to healthy controls, and cross-sectional associated with higher
      levels of systemic (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], CRP, TNF-alpha,
      IFN-gamma) and mucosal inflammation (interleukin-8, IFN-gamma) at onset.
      Conversely, a negative cross-sectional association with parasympathetic activity 
      was found for ESR & TNF-alpha. Longitudinally, parasympathetic activity at onset 
      predicted systemic (ESR, WBC), but not mucosal inflammation during follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study further strengthens the association between 
      the ANS system and intestinal inflammation previously found in animal models and 
      recently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These results may have
      important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Phase 3 trials have shown the efficacy of vedolizumab, which
      binds to integrin alpha4beta7, in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effectiveness and safety of
      vedolizumab in patients who failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS:
      From June through December 2014, there were 173 patients with CD and 121 patients
      with UC who were included in a multicenter nominative compassionate early access 
      program granted by French regulatory agencies. This program provided patients
      with access to vedolizumab before it was authorized for marketing. Vedolizumab
      (300 mg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8
      weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and
      the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. We report results obtained after the
      14-week induction phase. RESULTS: Among the 294 patients treated with vedolizumab
      (mean age, 39.5 +/- 14.0 y; mean disease duration, 10.8 +/- 7.6 y; concomitant
      steroids, 44% of cases), 276 completed the induction period, however, 18
      discontinued vedolizumab because of a lack of response (n = 14), infusion-related
      reaction (n = 2), or infections (n = 2). At week 14, 31% of patients with CD were
      in steroid-free clinical remission and 51% had a response; among patients with
      UC, 36% were in steroid-free clinical remission and 50% had a response. No deaths
      were reported. Severe adverse events occurred in 24 patients (8.2%), including 15
      (5.1%) that led to vedolizumab discontinuation (1 case of pulmonary tuberculosis 
      and 1 rectal adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with CD or UC 
      who failed previous anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, approximately one third
      of patients achieved steroid-free clinical remission after 14 weeks of induction 
      therapy with vedolizumab. This agent had an acceptable safety profile in these
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is involved in both pathogenesis and
      exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study was designed to evaluate
      whether resveratrol, an excellent anti-oxidant agent, can help in treatment of UC
      and its related oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty six patients with
      active mild to moderate disease were randomized to receive either 500 mg/day
      resveratrol capsules or the same amount of placebo for 6 weeks. Before and after 
      the intervention, disease activity, quality of life, and oxidative stress were
      assessed using the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire (SCCAIQ),
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-9 (IBDQ-9), and serum level of
      malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total anti-oxidant
      capacity (TAC), respectively. Serum SOD (122.28 +/- 11.55 to 125.77 +/- 10.97)
      and TAC (9.87 +/- 1.51-11.97 +/- 1.61) increased, whereas serum MDA (5.62 +/-
      1.18-3.42 +/- 1.01) decreased significantly in resveratrol group (p <0.001).
      Moreover, resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased disease activity
      and increased the quality of life (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that 
      500 mg/day resveratrol supplementation can improve the disease activity and
      quality of life in patients with UC at least partially through reduction of
      oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of
      supplementation for these patients.

TI  - Northern Latitude but Not Season Is Associated with Increased Rates of
      Hospitalizations Related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results of a Multi-Year
      Analysis of a National Cohort.
PG  - e0161523
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is growing evidence that the incidence and severity of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be geographically and seasonally related.
      Why these associations are observed remains unclear. We assessed the impact of
      geographic location, season, and exposure to ultraviolet light on disease
      severity by measuring national hospital IBD-related discharge rates. METHODS:
      Utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified all patients with 
      IBD-related discharges from 2001-2007. Patients were included if they were
      discharged from states above the 40th parallel (north) or at or below the 35th
      parallel (south); and their discharge fell within the winter (January, February, 
      and March) or summer (July, August, and September). Groups of patients were
      assessed comparing north to south within each season, and summer to winter within
      each region. UV index was recorded from the National Weather Service data and
      compared to monthly discharge rates. RESULTS: There was a consistent pattern of
      increased IBD-related hospitalization rates in northern states compared to
      southern states for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Differences in
      IBD-related hospitalization rates by season, however, were not uniform across the
      years studied. UV index was significantly inversely associated although not
      proportional to discharge rates for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the US, there is a significant increased rate of IBD-related
      hospitalizations in the northern compared to southern states, which not fully
      explained by differences in UV exposure.

TI  - The Challenges of Living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Summary of a Summit on 
      Patient and Healthcare Provider Perspectives.

AB  - Canada has one of the highest rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the
      disease represents a significant health, social, and economic burden. There is
      currently no cure for IBD, although earlier diagnosis and new therapies have
      improved the overall health outcomes and quality of life for patients. Crohn's
      and Colitis Canada is Canada's only national, volunteer-based charity dedicated
      to finding cures for IBD and improving the lives of those affected, through
      research, education, patient programs, advocacy, and increased awareness. On
      April 30, 2015, Crohn's and Colitis Canada hosted the "Patient and Healthcare
      Professional Summit on the Burden of Disease in IBD" to obtain a deeper
      understanding of the unmet needs of IBD patients and their caregivers. Through
      personal vignettes, patients articulated a pressing need to increase
      understanding of the challenges faced by people suffering from IBD among both
      health care professionals and the general public, develop best practices for
      navigating life transitions and addressing the unique challenges faced by
      children with IBD, and provide equitable access to appropriate, effective, and
      affordable treatments. The recommendations that emerged from the summit will
      inform about efforts to increase public awareness, inform about advocacy
      strategies, and contribute to the development of research priorities.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal parasites: a view from South America.
PG  - 153-8
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder of
      uncertain etiology. Several studies have proposed the possible role of intestinal
      parasites in the pathogenesis of IBS. We aimed to summarize the epidemiological
      studies that describe a possible link between intestinal parasites and IBS, with 
      special interest in endemic areas for intestinal parasitism such as South
      America. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted by using the
      keywords: irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal parasites, protozoan infection,
      soil-transmitted helminths and South America. Giardia lamblia may cause IBS
      symptoms that can persist several years after effective treatment. Dientamoeba
      fragilis can cause IBS-like symptoms, but low sensitive parasitological
      techniques may fail to detect it. Entamoeba histolytica can cause a chronic
      non-dysenteric colitis, but several studies have failed to find an association
      with IBS. The role of Blastocystis hominis in IBS remains controversial. In
      addition, epidemiological studies evaluating the effect of soil-transmitted
      helminths in IBS are scant. Symptoms elicited by intestinal parasites may
      resemble to those in IBS, especially in endemic areas such as South America,
      where both the prevalence of IBS and intestinal parasitism are high. Whether
      these organisms are the cause or contributing factors in IBS remains a subject of
      study. Routine parasitologicalexamination of stools in individuals who full-fit
      the criteria for IBS should be included upon initial assessment in endemic
      countries.

TI  - Impact of staged surgery on quality of life in refractory ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 643-649
LID - 10.1007/s00464-016-5010-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coloproctomucosectomy (CPM) with ileopouchanal anastomosis (IPAA), 
      as the procedure of choice for surgical management of ulcerative colitis (UC), is
      commonly performed either as a 2- or 3-staged procedure. For patients with
      considerable immunosuppression, reduced nutritional or general health status, and
      as part of emergency treatment, a 3-staged (3S) procedure is recommended by
      guidelines to minimize perioperative complication rates compared to 2-staged (2S)
      procedure. However, the necessity of additional hospitalization and surgery is
      suspect to affect quality of life (QoL). In this prospective, observational
      study, we evaluate the long-term QoL after 2- and 3-staged interventions of CPM
      with IPAA for patients with UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2011, a
      total of 233 patients underwent CPM and had a 2- or 3-staged procedure. In 108
      patients, surgical procedure was completed, and evaluation of QoL was performed
      by specific questionnaires (IBDQ, FIQoL, SF-12, CCS) up to 20 years after
      ileostomy closure. Data were collected within the framework of a prospective
      study. RESULTS: Observing a total of 84 patients (2S: n = 59; 3S: n = 25), QoL
      measured by IBDQ was higher after CPM, compared to preoperative (2S: 15 --> 31;
      3S: 17 --> 28; p < 0.01), with no differences between 2S or 3S procedures (p >
      0.05). Specific QoL assessment concerning incontinence and stool frequency (CCS, 
      FIQoL) did not differ either (CCS: 2S:3S = 12:15; p > 0.05). General
      health-related QoL, determined by SF-12 score, did not differ between 2S or 3S
      procedures. CONCLUSION: The indication for a 2-staged or 3-staged procedure
      should be adjusted to the severity of the underlying disease, nutritional status 
      of the patient, and the extent of immunosuppression at the time of surgery. It
      should not be affected by the fear of complications or a reduced quality of life 
      by additional surgery in 3-staged versus 2-staged procedures.

TI  - Potential Benefits of Dietary Fibre Intervention in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17060919 [doi]
LID - E919 [pii]
AB  - Intestinal dysbiosis is thought to be an important cause of disease progression
      and the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a
      dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly
      induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases.
      Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may
      potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms
      include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or
      indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may
      degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form
      short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act
      more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits
      in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require 
      other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically
      examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary
      patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be
      possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may
      offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.

TI  - Phenotypic and Genotypic Characterisation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Presenting Before the Age of 2 years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] presenting in early childhood is
      extremely rare. More recently, progress has been made to identify children with
      monogenic forms of IBD predominantly presenting very early in life. In this
      study, we describe the heterogeneous phenotypes and genotypes of patients with
      IBD presenting before the age of 2 years and establish phenotypic features
      associated with underlying monogenicity. METHODS: Phenotype data of 62 children
      with disease onset before the age of 2 years presenting over the past 20 years
      were reviewed. Children without previously established genetic diagnosis were
      prospectively recruited for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: In all, 62
      patients [55% male] were identified. The median disease onset was 3 months of age
      (interquartile range [IQR]: 1 to 11). Conventional IBD classification only
      applied to 15 patients with Crohn's disease [CD]-like [24%] and three with
      ulcerative colitis [UC]-like [5%] phenotype; 44 patients [71%] were diagnosed
      with otherwise unclassifiable IBD. Patients frequently required parenteral
      nutrition [40%], extensive immunosuppression [31%], haematopoietic stem-cell
      transplantation [29%], and abdominal surgery [19%]. In 31% of patients,
      underlying monogenic diseases were established [EPCAM, IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB,
      FOXP3, LRBA, SKIV2L, TTC37, TTC7A]. Phenotypic features significantly more
      prevalent in monogenic IBD were: consanguinity, disease onset before the 6th
      month of life, stunting, extensive intestinal disease and histological evidence
      of epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: IBD in children with disease onset
      before the age of 2 years is frequently unclassifiable into Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, particularly treatment resistant, and can be
      indistinguishable from monogenic diseases with IBD-like phenotype.

TI  - Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is inversely associated with mucosal
      inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 113-20
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.115.123786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D exerts anti-inflammatory actions both in vitro and in
      murine models of colitis. In previous studies, we demonstrated that vitamin D
      protects against the development of colitis by maintaining the integrity of the
      intestinal mucosal barrier. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether deficient
      serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with increased 
      mucosal inflammation, a loss of epithelial junctional proteins, and an increase
      in mucosal inflammatory cytokines in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).
      DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled 230 subjects with UC. Serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations were compared with the Mayo endoscopic score, the total Mayo
      score, and histologic activity. Colonic mucosal expression concentrations of
      vitamin D receptor (VDR), E-cadherin, zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1), occludin,
      claudin-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) were
      compared between dichotomous groups with low or high serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations. RESULTS: The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 21.8 ng/mL.
      Subjects stratified by concentrations included 12.6% >/=30 ng/mL, 45.6% >/=20 to 
      <30 ng/mL, 37.4% >/=10 to <20 ng/mL, and 4.4% <10 ng/mL. There was an inverse
      association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and mucosal inflammation as
      assessed by the Mayo endoscopy score (P = 0.01), disease activity as indicated by
      the total Mayo score (P = 0.001), and histologic activity (P = 0.02). A serum
      25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL was associated with decreased mucosal transcript 
      and protein expression concentrations of VDR, E-cadherin, and occludin as well as
      decreased protein expression of ZO-1, whereas TNF-alpha and IL-8 mucosal
      transcript expression concentrations were increased. CONCLUSIONS: In UC patients,
      serum 25(OH)D concentration is inversely correlated with mucosal inflammation and
      disease activity. These results, coupled with the findings that serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations correlate with the mucosal expression of VDR as well as epithelial
      junction proteins and inversely with proinflammatory cytokines, suggest that
      vitamin D deficiency may contribute to UC inflammation by disrupting epithelial
      barrier function.

TI  - Fecal Microbiota Transplantation as a Novel Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e3765
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003765 [doi]
AB  - Variation in clinical evidence has prevented the adoption of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to
      conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and
      safety of FMT in UC.A systematic literature search was performed in 5 electronic 
      databases from inception through September 2015. Inclusion criteria were reports 
      of FMT in patients with UC. Studies were excluded if they did not report clinical
      outcomes or included patients with infections. Clinical remission (CR) was
      defined as the primary outcome.Eleven studies (2 randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs), 1 open-label case-control study, and 8 cohort studies) with a total of
      133 UC patients were included in the analysis. In 11 studies (including 8
      noncontrol cohort studies and the treatment arms of 3 clinical control trials),
      the pooled proportion of patients who achieved CR was 30.4% (95% CI 22.6-39.4%), 
      with a low risk of heterogeneity (Cochran Q test, P = 0.139; I = 33%). A subgroup
      analysis suggested that no difference in CR was detected between upper
      gastrointestinal delivery versus lower gastrointestinal delivery. Furthermore,
      subgroup analysis revealed that there was no difference in CR between single
      infusion versus multiple infusions (>1) of FMT. All studies reported mild adverse
      events.FMT is potentially useful in UC disease management but better-designed
      RCTs are still required to confirm our findings before wide adoption of FMT is
      suggested. Additionally, basic guidelines are needed imminently to identify the
      right patient population and to standardize the process of FMT.

TI  - Surgical Treatment of Crohn Colitis Involving More Than 2 Colonic Segments:
      Long-Term Outcomes From a Single Institution.
PG  - e3793
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003793 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of primary Crohn colitis is uncommon and surgical treatment has
      remained controversial, although most patients with Crohn colitis eventually
      require surgical intervention. This study aims to compare the operative outcomes 
      of patients who underwent segmental versus either total colectomy or total
      proctocolectomy for Crohn colitis and to assess potential risk factors associated
      with clinical and surgical recurrence-free survivals.This is a retrospective
      study of 116 patients who underwent primary surgery for Crohn colitis between
      August 1997 and July 2011. Patients were classified based on the type of surgery:
      segmental colectomy (SC group; n = 71) or either total colectomy or total
      proctocolectomy (TC group; n = 45).There were no significant differences in
      postoperative complications or the nutritional state between the SC and TC
      groups. Patients in TC group had a significantly higher clinical recurrence-free 
      survival (CRFS). Among the 54 patients with multisegmental Crohn colitis, the TC 
      group had a significantly increased CRFS and surgical recurrence-free survival
      (SRFS), compared with patients in the SC group (5-year CRFS: 82.0% +/- 5.8% vs
      22.2% +/- 13.9%, P = 0.001; 5-year SRFS: 88.1% +/- 5.0% vs 44.4% +/- 16.6%, P =
      0.001). By multivariate analysis of patients with multisegments involved, SC was 
      a risk factor for SRFS and CRFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.637, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 1.387-15.509, P = 0.013 and HR = 32.407, 95% CI = 2.873-365.583, 
      P = 0.005).TC patients have significantly increased CRFS and TC in patients with 
      multisegment involvement may affect improved SRFS and CRFS. Among patients with
      multisegmental Crohn colitis, SC is an independent risk factor for CRFS and SRFS.

TI  - Impact of sarcopenia on surgical site infection after restorative proctocolectomy
      for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 92-98
AB  - PURPOSE: The coexistence of sarcopenia is associated with postoperative
      complications, including infection after abdominal surgery. We evaluated the
      association between sarcopenia and surgical site infection (SSI) after surgery
      for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 69
      patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy with perioperative abdominal
      computed tomography (CT). Sarcopenia was diagnosed by measuring the
      cross-sectional area of the right and left psoas muscles as the total psoas
      muscle area on CT images. We assessed whether sarcopenia was associated with SSI 
      and clinical factors, including nutritional and inflammatory markers. RESULTS:
      The lowest quartiles defined as sarcopenia in men and women were 567.4 and 355.8 
      mm(2)/m(2), respectively. According to this classification, 12 men and 6 women
      had sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had a lower body mass index (p = 0.0004)
      and a higher C-reactive protein concentration (p = 0.05) than those without
      sarcopenia. SSIs were identified in 12 patients (17.3 %) and included six pelvic 
      abscesses and seven wound infections. According to multivariate analysis,
      sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for SSI (odds ratio = 4.91, 95 %
      confidence interval 1.09-23.5, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is predictive of
      SSI after pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, result from 
      the uncontrolled inflammation that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals 
      and the dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The response of 
      these immune systems to luminal gut microbiota and their products results in
      altered intestinal permeability, loss of barrier function, and mucosal
      inflammation and ulceration. Animal models of experiment intestinal inflammation 
      have been developed that leverage the development of spontaneous inflammation in 
      certain mouse strains, e.g. Samp1/Yit mice, or induction of inflammation using
      gene-targeting e.g. IL-10 null mice, administration of exogenous agents e.g. DSS,
      or adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice, e.g. CD4(+) CD45Rb(Hi)
      T-cell transfer. Colitis induced by rectal instillation of the haptenizing agent,
      2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, is one of the most commonly used and
      well-characterized models of Crohn's disease in humans.

TI  - Management of Acute Severe Colitis in Children With Ulcerative Colitis in the
      Biologics Era.
LID - 10.1542/peds.2015-1184 [doi]
LID - e20151184 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Approximately one-third of children with ulcerative
      colitis will experience at least 1 attack of acute severe colitis (ASC) before 15
      years of age. Severe disease can be defined in children when Pediatric Ulcerative
      Colitis Activity Index is >65 and/or >/=6 bloody stools per day, and/or 1 of the 
      following: tachycardia, fever, anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate with or without systemic toxicity. Our aim was to provide practical
      suggestions on the management of ASC in children. The goal of medical therapy is 
      to avoid colectomy while preventing complications of disease, side effects of
      medications, and mortality. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out through 
      Medline via PubMed to identify all articles published in English to date, based
      on the following keywords "ulcerative colitis," "pediatric ulcerative colitis,"
      "biological therapy," and "acute severe colitis." Multidisciplinary clinical
      evaluation is recommended to identify early nonresponders to conventional
      treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, and to start, if indicated,
      second-line therapy or "rescue therapy," such as calcineurin inhibitors
      (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and anti-tumor necrosis factor molecules (infliximab).
      RESULTS: Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index is a valid predictive tool
      that can guide clinicians in evaluating response to therapy. Surgery should be
      considered in the case of complications or rapid clinical deterioration during
      medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Several pitfalls may be present in the management
      of ASC, and a correct clinical and therapeutic approach is recommended to reduce 
      surgical risk.

TI  - Serum Fatty Acids Are Correlated with Inflammatory Cytokines in Ulcerative
      Colitis.
PG  - e0156387
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0156387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with increased dietary
      intake of fat and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Modification of fat
      metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess
      differences in dietary and serum fatty acid levels between control and UC
      subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines.
      METHODS: Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively 
      collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the
      Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were
      measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography.
      RESULTS: UC subjects had increased total fat and oleic acid (OA) intake, but
      decreased arachidonic acid (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less
      percent saturated fatty acid (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty
      acids (MUFA), linoleic acid, OA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and
      docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly
      correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC
      subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy blunted these
      associations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids 
      in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines. We propose
      that fatty acids may affect cytokine production and thus be immunomodulatory in
      UC.

TI  - Intestinal APCs of the endogenous nanomineral pathway fail to express PD-L1 in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 26747
LID - 10.1038/srep26747 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition most commonly affecting the
      ileum and colon. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is complex and may include
      defects in peptidoglycan recognition, and/or failures in the establishment of
      intestinal tolerance. We have recently described a novel constitutive endogenous 
      delivery system for the translocation of nanomineral-antigen-peptidoglycan (NAP) 
      conjugates to antigen presenting cells (APCs) in intestinal lymphoid patches. In 
      mice NAP conjugate delivery to APCs results in high surface expression of the
      immuno-modulatory molecule programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here we
      report that NAP conjugate positive APCs in human ileal tissues from individuals
      with ulcerative colitis and intestinal carcinomas, also have high expression of
      PD-L1. However, NAP-conjugate positive APCs in intestinal tissue from patients
      with Crohn's disease show selective failure in PD-L1 expression. Therefore, in
      Crohn's disease intestinal antigen taken up by lymphoid patch APCs will be
      presented without PD-L1 induced tolerogenic signalling, perhaps initiating
      disease.

TI  - (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate decreases colonic inflammation and permeability in
      a mouse model of colitis, but reduces macronutrient digestion and exacerbates
      weight loss.
PG  - 2267-2274
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201501042 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to have putative
      health effects including the prevention of inflammation and obesity.
      Historically, polyphenols have been regarded as antinutritionals and while such
      effects may be beneficial in obese subjects, they may be deleterious in
      nutritionally compromised individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the
      effect of EGCG in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mouse model of
      ulcerative colitis. Following induction of colitis, mice were treated with EGCG
      (3.2 mg/g) as the sole source of drinking fluid for 3 days. EGCG treatment
      mitigated DSS-induced colon shortening and spleen enlargement. EGCG also
      decreased colonic protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, as well as colonic lipid peroxides compared to DSS-treated
      controls. We observed that EGCG reduced DSS-induced gastrointestinal
      permeability. These beneficial effects were offset by enhanced body weight loss
      in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. These effects were related
      to decreased protein and lipid digestion in EGCG-treated mice compared to
      DSS-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although EGCG may
      exert anti-inflammatory effects, its ability to modulate macronutrient digestion 
      may represent a dose-limiting adverse effect that must be considered in the
      context of its use for treating inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Composition and function of the pediatric colonic mucosal microbiome in untreated
      patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 384-96
LID - 10.1080/19490976.2016.1190073 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders
      characterized by a complex disruption of the physiologic interaction between the 
      host immune system and intestinal microbes precipitated by environmental factors.
      Numerous observations indicate the altered composition and function of the
      intestinal microbiome of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of IBD.
      The accuracy of these results may be limited by confounding factors, such as
      concurrent medication use. To address these limitations, we examined the colonic 
      mucosal microbiome of pediatric patients with UC prior to initiating treatment.
      Based on bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified a significant decrease
      in the phylum Verrucomicrobia in patients with UC. At the genus level, we
      observed a significant decrease in the short chain fatty acid producer Roseburia.
      Despite these compositional changes, we did not identify inferred gene content
      differences between the UC and control groups. To determine if microbial taxa may
      be associated with clinical outcomes, we retrospectively assessed the clinical
      course of the UC patients. Despite similar metrics of OTU richness and diversity,
      multiple OTU differences were observed between patients who responded to therapy 
      and those who did not. Our observations regarding the mucosal microbiome and the 
      associations with differential clinical outcomes support the contributions of gut
      microbes to disease onset and modulation.

TI  - Appendectomy does not decrease the risk of future colectomy in UC: results from a
      large cohort and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1390-1397
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2016-311550 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Early appendectomy is inversely associated with the development of
      UC. However, the impact of appendectomy on the clinical course of UC is
      controversial, generally favouring a milder disease course. We aim to describe
      the effect appendectomy has on the disease course of UC with focus on the timing 
      of appendectomy in relation to UC diagnosis. DESIGN: Using the National Institute
      of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics
      Consortium database of patients with UC, the risk of colectomy was compared
      between patients who did and did not undergo appendectomy. In addition, we
      performed a meta-analysis of studies that examined the association between
      appendectomy and colectomy. RESULTS: 2980 patients with UC were initially
      included. 111 (4.4%) patients with UC had an appendectomy; of which 63 were
      performed prior to UC diagnosis and 48 after diagnosis. In multivariable
      analysis, appendectomy performed at any time was an independent risk factor for
      colectomy (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1), with appendectomy performed after UC
      diagnosis most strongly associated with colectomy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.5). An
      updated meta-analysis showed appendectomy performed either prior to or after UC
      diagnosis had no effect on colectomy rates. CONCLUSIONS: Appendectomy performed
      at any time in relation to UC diagnosis was not associated with a decrease in
      severity of disease. In fact, appendectomy after UC diagnosis may be associated
      with a higher risk of colectomy. These findings question the proposed use of
      appendectomy as treatment for UC.

TI  - Is There a Role for the Enteral Administration of Serum-Derived Immunoglobulins
      in Human Gastrointestinal Disease and Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition?
PG  - 535-43
LID - 10.3945/an.115.011924 [doi]
AB  - Twenty years ago, there was profound, international interest in developing oral
      human, bovine, or chicken egg-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) for the prevention and 
      nutritional treatment of childhood malnutrition and gastrointestinal disease,
      including acute diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. Although such Ig products
      were shown to be effective, with both nutritional and antidiarrheal benefits,
      interest waned because of their cost and because of the perceived risk of bovine 
      serum encephalitis (BSE). BSE is no longer considered a barrier to use of oral
      Ig, because the WHO has declared the United States to be BSE-free since the early
      2000s. Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed 
      and are regulated as medical foods. These new products, called serum bovine Igs
      (SBIs), facilitate the management of chronic or severe gastrointestinal
      disturbances in both children and adults and are regulated by the US Food and
      Drug Administration. Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could
      potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other
      conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control
      without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in
      conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could
      potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for 
      their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential 
      process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, 
      thereby leading to intestinal inflammation. Thus, oral Ig may emerge as an
      important "add-on" therapy for a variety of gastrointestinal and nutritional
      problems during the next decade.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, a growing amount of evidence supports the role of
      microbes and an imbalanced microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While 
      many reviews have been written on the microbiota in IBD, few have considered how 
      they fulfil the Koch's postulates. In this review, we consider how the Koch's
      postulates might be modified so that they can be fulfilled for polymicrobial
      diseases, and we discuss the progress made to date in fulfilling them.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and medication: Cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort.
PG  - 1270-80
LID - 10.1002/ijc.30183 [doi]
AB  - The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed since the
      mid-1990s (e.g., use of thiopurines/anti-TNFalpha agents, improved surveillance
      programs), possibly affecting cancer risk. To establish current cancer risk in
      IBD, updates are warranted from cohorts covering this time span, and detailed
      enough to study associations with phenotype and medication. We studied
      intestinal-, extra-intestinal- and overall cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort. In total, 1,157 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,644
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, and
      followed until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for CD 
      and UC separately, as well as for gender-, phenotype-, disease duration-,
      diagnosis era- and medication groups. We found an increased risk for colorectal
      cancer in CD patients with colon involvement (SIR 2.97; 95% CI 1.08-6.46), but
      not in the total CD or UC population. In addition, CD patients were at increased 
      risk for hematologic- (2.41; 1.04-4.76), overall skin- (1.55; 1.06-2.19), skin
      squamous cell- (SCC; 3.83; 1.83-7.04) and overall cancer (1.28; 1.01-1.60),
      whereas UC patients had no increased risk for extra-intestinal- and overall
      cancer. Finally, in a medication analysis on CD and UC together, long-term
      immunosuppression exposure (>12 months) was associated with an increased risk for
      hematologic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, SCC and overall cancer, and this
      increase was mainly attributed to thiopurines. IBD patients with long-term
      immunosuppression exposure can be considered as having a higher cancer risk, and 
      our data support the advice in recent IBD guidelines to consider skin cancer
      screening in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of
      multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease
      progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its
      dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific
      clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIM: To use a
      formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a
      clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices,
      optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.
      METHODS: The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists
      from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using
      the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of
      scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering
      committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based 
      data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on
      treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group 
      as a whole, in order to reach a consensus. RESULTS: A clinical practice guideline
      covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i)
      moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory
      proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited
      available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop
      simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations
      that is now accessible via an online application.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of adiposity on bone mass in the early phases of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children and adolescents is unclear. The aim 
      of this study was to determine the role of adiposity on bone mass in the first 3 
      y of diagnosis of IBD. The expected result is that increased adiposity will be
      associated with increased bone mass in both the controls and IBD subjects.
      METHODS: Height-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of 25 subjects, age 
      13.97 +/- 2.70 y, diagnosed with IBD for <4 y were compared to 24 controls, age
      13.65 +/- 2.60 y. Overweight was defined as BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, 
      and obesity as BMI >/=95th percentile. Severity of IBD was determined by the
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index.
      RESULTS: Before stratification by BMI criterion, height-adjusted BMD z-scores
      were not significantly lower in IBD subjects versus controls for both the femoral
      neck (-0.8 +/- 1.1 versus -0.06 +/- 1.1, P = 0.070) and lumbar vertebrae (-0.4
      +/- 1.2 versus 0.2 +/- 1.2, P = 0.086). Following stratification, height-adjusted
      BMD z-scores were significantly lower in the overweight/obese IBD subjects versus
      overweight/obese controls for femoral neck (-0.9 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 1.3, P = 
      0.032); and non-significantly lower for the lumbar spine z-score (-0.4 +/- 1.6
      versus 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = 0.197). BMD z-score had no relationship with the duration
      of disease, steroid therapy, and the severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Adiposity
      was associated with reduced bone mass in the early phases of IBD, but with
      increased bone mass in the controls.

TI  - Treatment Options and Outcomes of Pediatric IBDU Compared with Other IBD
      Subtypes: A Retrospective Multicenter Study from the IBD Porto Group of ESPGHAN.
PG  - 1378-83
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000767 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) is the rarest IBD
      subtype with treatment based on extrapolation from ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD) studies. We compared IBDU treatment choices with other
      colonic IBDs and explored long-term outcomes. METHODS: This was a multicenter
      retrospective longitudinal study of 23 centers of pediatric IBD with isolated
      colitis, including a mild ileitis consistent with backwash. RESULTS: Of note, 797
      children (median age: 11.6 years, range: 2-18.4) were included: 250 with CD, 287 
      with UC, and 260 with IBDU (median follow-up: 2.8 [interquartile range: 1.6-4.2] 
      years). IBDU differed from UC with lower corticosteroid (154 [59%] versus 204
      [71%]; P = 0.004) and higher exclusive enteral nutrition use (26 [10%] versus 2
      [0.6%]; P < 0.0001). Compared to patients with CD, patients with IBDU received
      less exclusive enteral nutrition and immunomodulators (26 [10%] versus 93 [37%]; 
      P < 0.0001 and 67 [26%] versus 129 [52%]; P < 0.0001, respectively) but more
      aminosalicylates (228 [88%] versus 159 [64%]; P < 0.0001). Biological treatment
      was significantly higher in CD (82 [34%]) than in IBDU and UC (24 [12%] and 47
      [17%], respectively; P < 0.0001). At last follow-up, 135 (69%) patients with IBDU
      had remission/mild disease activity compared with 100 (46%; P < 0.0001) patients 
      with CD and 174 (64%; P = 0.3) patients with UC. Four (2%) of 194 patients with
      IBDU underwent surgery compared with 22 (8%) of 270 patients with UC (P = 0.009) 
      and 20 (8%) of 238 patients with CD (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBDU 
      have a lower medication burden and lower surgery rates than other IBD subtypes.
      The disease course at follow-up is generally mild, supporting an initial trial
      with 5-ASA before using more aggressive therapies.

TI  - Timing of Last Preoperative Dose of Infliximab Does Not Increase Postoperative
      Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
PG  - 2602-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4171-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between preoperative use of infliximab and
      postoperative complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
      a subject of continued debate. Results from studies examining an association
      between the timing of last preoperative dose of infliximab and postoperative
      complications remain inconsistent. AIMS: To assess whether timing of last dose of
      infliximab prior to surgery affects the rate of postoperative complications in
      patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Retrospective chart
      review of IBD patients who have undergone surgery while receiving therapy with
      infliximab was conducted. Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis.
      RESULTS: No significant association was found between timing of infliximab and
      the rate of postoperative complications. Age, gender, disease type, steroid use, 
      preoperative status, surgery type, or surgeon type was not associated with
      increased rate of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Timing of last dose of
      infliximab does not affect the rate of postoperative complications in patients
      with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results 
      From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
      disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
      epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
      the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
      and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment,
      consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and
      dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases
      developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched
      with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate 
      odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy 
      intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the
      highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61
      (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) 
      for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34,
      p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals
      consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) 
      and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
      CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
      developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
      Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

TI  - A key requirement for CD300f in innate immune responses of eosinophils in
      colitis.
PG  - 172-183
LID - 10.1038/mi.2016.37 [doi]
AB  - Eosinophils are traditionally studied in the context of type 2 immune responses. 
      However, recent studies highlight key innate immune functions for eosinophils
      especially in colonic inflammation. Surprisingly, molecular pathways regulating
      innate immune activities of eosinophil are largely unknown. We have recently
      shown that the CD300f is highly expressed by colonic eosinophils. Nonetheless,
      the role of CD300f in governing innate immune eosinophil activities is
      ill-defined. RNA sequencing of 162 pediatric Crohn's disease patients revealed
      upregulation of multiple Cd300 family members, which correlated with the presence
      of severe ulcerations and inflammation. Increased expression of CD300 family
      receptors was also observed in active ulcerative colitis (UC) and in mice
      following induction of experimental colitis. Specifically, the expression of
      CD300f was dynamically regulated in monocytes and eosinophils. Dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-treated Cd300f(-/-) mice exhibit attenuated disease activity and
      histopathology in comparison with DSS-treated wild type (WT). Decreased disease
      activity in Cd300f(-/-) mice was accompanied with reduced inflammatory cell
      infiltration and nearly abolished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
      Monocyte depletion and chimeric bone marrow transfer experiments revealed a
      cell-specific requirement for CD300f in innate immune activation of eosinophils. 
      Collectively, we uncover a new pathway regulating innate immune activities of
      eosinophils, a finding with significant implications in eosinophil-associated
      gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - Frankincense--therapeutic properties.
PG  - 380-91
AB  - Recently, increasing interest in natural dietary and therapeutic preparations
      used as dietary supplements has been observed. One of them is frankincense. This 
      traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory,
      expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The
      present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia
      resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific
      studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%)
      and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl acetate (21.4%), octyl acetate (13.4%) and 
      methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is
      characteristic of 11-keto-ss-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid,
      acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid. Contemporary
      studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and
      anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties,
      extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be
      particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of
      rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans.
      Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of
      leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of
      Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have 
      an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour
      cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect
      since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell
      death (apoptosis).

TI  - DNA damage and apoptosis in blood neutrophils of inflammatory bowel disease
      patients and in Caco-2 cells in vitro exposed to betanin.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders 
      of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered 
      an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous
      studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major 
      component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA
      damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human
      polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study
      was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis 
      in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were
      compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin
      treatment at the concentration of 100 muM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed 
      by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less
      pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2
      caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells,
      but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also
      induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity.
      These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the
      release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert
      anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.

TI  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease, and the relationship with biochemical markers of
      disease activity.
PG  - 181-8
LID - 10.1111/apt.13636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease
      in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to
      reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms
      in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the
      relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity.
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of 
      three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity
      was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity
      was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed 
      using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184
      patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative
      colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease:
      4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children
      with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's
      disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin 
      or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type 
      symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12;
      CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence 
      of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly
      dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much
      lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal
      inflammation.

PG  - 261-4
LID - 10.1038/gene.2016.17 [doi]
AB  - The function of the Laccase domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene is unknown, but
      genetic variation at this locus has been reported to consistently affect the risk
      of Crohn's disease (CD) and leprosy. Recently, a LACC1 missense mutation was
      found in patients suffering from monogenic forms of CD, but also systemic
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We tested the hypothesis that LACC1 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in addition to CD, are associated with juvenile 
      idiopathic arthritis (JIA, non-systemic), and another major form of inflammatory 
      bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC). We selected 11 LACC1 tagging SNPs, and
      tested their effect on disease risk in 3855 Swedish individuals from three
      case-control cohorts of CD, UC and JIA. We detected false discovery rate
      corrected significant associations with individual markers in all three cohorts, 
      thereby expanding previous results for CD also to UC and JIA. LACC1's link to
      several inflammatory diseases suggests a key role in the human immune system and 
      justifies further characterization of its function(s).

LID - 10.1038/mi.2016.43 [doi]
AB  - Development of the intestinal microbiota during early life serves as a key
      regulatory stage in establishing the host-microbial relationship. This symbiotic 
      relationship contributes to developing host immunity and maintaining health
      throughout the life span. This study was to develop an approach to colonize
      conventionally raised mice with a model probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG), and to determine the effects of LGG colonization on
      intestinal development and prevention of colitis in adulthood. LGG colonization
      in conventionally raised was established by administering LGG to pregnant mice
      starting at gestational day 18 and pups at postnatal days 1- 5. LGG colonization 
      promoted bodyweight gain and increased diversity and richness of the colonic
      mucosa-associated microbiota before weaning. Intestinal epithelial cell
      proliferation, differentiation, tight junction formation, and mucosal IgA
      production were all significantly enhanced in LGG-colonized mice. Adult mice
      colonized with LGG showed increased IgA production and decreased susceptibility
      to intestinal injury and inflammation induced in the dextran sodium sulfate model
      of colitis. Thus, neonatal colonization of mice with LGG enhances intestinal
      functional maturation and IgA production and confers lifelong health consequences
      on protection from intestinal injury and inflammation. This strategy might be
      applied for benefiting health in the host.

      Cohort Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) may worsen the prognosis of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The objectives of this study were to: (i) validate the
      International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) code for C. difficile; (ii) 
      determine the risk of C. difficile infection after diagnosis of UC; (iii)
      evaluate the effect of C. difficile infection on the risk of colectomy; and (iv) 
      assess the association between C. difficile and postoperative complications.
      METHODS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
      negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by comparing ICD-10 codes for C. 
      difficile with stool toxin tests. A population-based surveillance cohort of newly
      diagnosed UC patients living in Alberta, Canada were identified from 2003 to 2009
      (n=1,754). The effect of a C. difficile infection on colectomy was modeled using 
      competing risk survival regression after adjusting for covariates. The effect of 
      a C. difficile infection on postoperative complications was assessed using a
      mixed effects logistic regression model. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity,
      PPV, and NPV of the ICD-10 code for C. difficile were 82.1%, 99.4%, 88.4%, and
      99.1%, respectively. The risk of C. difficile infection within 5 years of
      diagnosis with UC was 3.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-4.6%). The risk of 
      colectomy was higher among UC patients diagnosed with C. difficile (sub-hazard
      ratio (sHR)=2.36; 95% CI: 1.47-3.80). C. difficile increased the risk of
      postoperative complications (odds ratio=4.84; 95% CI: 1.28-18.35). C. difficile
      was associated with mortality (sHR=2.56 times; 95% CI: 1.28-5.10). CONCLUSIONS:
      C. difficile diagnosis worsens the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with UC 
      by increasing the risk of colectomy, postoperative complications, and death.

TI  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction: implications for chronic inflammatory conditions 
      of the bowel.
PG  - 40-59
LID - 10.1017/S0954422416000019 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal epithelium of adult humans acts as a differentially permeable
      barrier that separates the potentially harmful contents of the lumen from the
      underlying tissues. Any dysfunction of this boundary layer that disturbs the
      homeostatic equilibrium between the internal and external environments may
      initiate and sustain a biochemical cascade that results in inflammation of the
      intestine. Key to such dysfunction are genetic, microbial and other environmental
      factors that, singularly or in combination, result in chronic inflammation that
      is symptomatic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present review
      is to assess the scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that defective
      transepithelial transport mechanisms and the heightened absorption of intact
      antigenic proinflammatory oligopeptides are important contributing factors in the
      pathogenesis of IBD.

TI  - Interobserver Variation Study of the Rutgeerts Score to Assess Endoscopic
      Recurrence after Surgery for Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1001-5
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After resection surgery for Crohn's disease, recurrence of endoscopic
      lesions at the site of the anastomosis or in the neoterminal ileum is graded
      according to the Rutgeerts score (RS). The goal of this study was to test the
      interobserver variability for RS. METHODS: Thirteen trained endoscopists
      evaluated the RS on 39 videotapes of patients who had undergone resection for
      Crohn's disease with an ileocolonic anastomosis 6 months earlier. Videotapes were
      randomly assigned to endoscopists through a balanced incomplete block design.
      Each videotape was scored independently by four endoscopists, and each
      endoscopist evaluated 12 videotapes, making a total of 156 videotape assessments.
      Reproducibility levels of the RS were assessed through unweighted kappa estimates
      among multiple raters. The proportion of inappropriate therapeutic initiation was
      estimated by randomly selecting one endoscopist for each videorecording, assuming
      that the majority of endoscopists correctly classified endoscopic recurrence.
      RESULTS: The kappa estimates were 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.52) for
      the RS on a 5-grade scale, 0.47 (0.28-0.66) for RS < i2 vs. >/= i2, and 0.64
      (0.42-0.85) for RS </= i2 vs. > i2. The percentages of inappropriate therapeutic 
      initiation were 12.8% (3.8-21.9) when initiation was triggered by a RS >/= i2 and
      8.3% (1.1-15.6) when initiation was triggered by a RS > i2 (p = 0.41).
      CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of the RS was moderate, especially when
      differentiating <i2 from >/=i2, which may lead to incorrect therapeutic decisions
      in >10% of patients.

TI  - Dietary Lipid Type, Rather Than Total Number of Calories, Alters Outcomes of
      Enteric Infection in Mice.
PG  - 1846-56
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw084 [doi]
AB  - Dietary lipids modulate immunity, yet the means by which specific fatty acids
      affect infectious disease susceptibility remains unclear. Deciphering
      lipid-induced immunity is critical to understanding the balance required for
      protecting against pathogens while avoiding chronic inflammatory diseases. To
      understand how specific lipids alter susceptibility to enteric infection, we fed 
      mice isocaloric, high-fat diets composed of corn oil (rich in n-6 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids [n-6 PUFAs]), olive oil (rich in monounsaturated fatty acids), or
      milk fat (rich in saturated fatty acids) with or without fish oil (rich in n-3
      PUFAs). After 5 weeks of dietary intervention, mice were challenged with
      Citrobacter rodentium, and pathological responses were assessed. Olive oil diets 
      resulted in little colonic pathology associated with intestinal alkaline
      phosphatase, a mucosal defense factor that detoxifies lipopolysaccharide. In
      contrast, while both corn oil and milk fat diets resulted in inflammation-induced
      colonic damage, only milk fat induced compensatory protective responses,
      including short chain fatty acid production. Fish oil combined with milk fat,
      unlike unsaturated lipid diets, had a protective effect associated with
      intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity. Overall, these results reveal that
      dietary lipid type, independent of the total number of calories associated with
      the dietary lipid, influences the susceptibility to enteric damage and the
      benefits of fish oil during infection.

TI  - FNDC4 acts as an anti-inflammatory factor on macrophages and improves colitis in 
      mice.
PG  - 11314
LID - 10.1038/ncomms11314 [doi]
AB  - FNDC4 is a secreted factor sharing high homology with the exercise-associated
      myokine irisin (FNDC5). Here we report that Fndc4 is robustly upregulated in
      several mouse models of inflammation as well as in human inflammatory conditions.
      Specifically, FNDC4 levels are increased locally at inflamed sites of the
      intestine of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Interestingly, administration
      of recombinant FNDC4 in the mouse model of induced colitis markedly reduces
      disease severity compared with mice injected with a control protein. Conversely, 
      mice lacking Fndc4 develop more severe colitis. Analysis of binding of FNDC4 to
      different immune cell types reveals strong and specific binding to macrophages
      and monocytes. FNDC4 treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro
      results in reduced phagocytosis, increased cell survival and reduced
      proinflammatory chemokine expression. Hence, treatment with FNDC4 results in a
      state of dampened macrophage activity, while enhancing their survival. Thus, we
      have characterized FNDC4 as a factor with direct therapeutic potential in
      inflammatory bowel disease and possibly other inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Genomic Alterations Observed in Colitis-Associated Cancers Are Distinct From
      Those Found in Sporadic Colorectal Cancers and Vary by Type of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel
      or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers
      (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC.
      METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial
      Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 
      2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of
      >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations.
      RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and
      18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the 
      ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or
      rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be
      significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less
      frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or
      Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by 
      a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding 
      IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF 
      V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were
      significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed 
      a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well
      as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations
      observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Mango polyphenolics reduce inflammation in intestinal colitis-involvement of the 
      miR-126/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 197-207
LID - 10.1002/mc.22484 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory
      effect of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) polyphenolics containing gallic acid and
      gallotanins, and the role of the miR-126/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in vitro
      and in vivo. Polyphenolics extracted from mango (var. Keitt) were investigated in
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated CCD-18Co cells. Rats received either a beverage 
      with mango polyphenolics or a control beverage, and were exposed to three cycles 
      of 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) followed by a 2-wk recovery period. The mango 
      extract (10 mg GAE/L) suppressed the protein expression of NF-kappaB,
      p-NF-kappaB, PI3K (p85beta), HIF-1alpha, p70S6K1, and RPS6 in LPS-treated
      CCD-18Co cells. LPS reduced miR-126 expression, whereas, the mango extract
      induced miR-126 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The relationship between
      miR-126 and its target, PI3K (p85beta), was confirmed by treating cells with
      miR-126 antagomiR where mango polyphenols reversed the effects of the antagomiR. 
      In vivo, mango beverage protected against DSS-induced colonic inflammation (47%, 
      P = 0.05) and decreased the Ki-67 labeling index in the central and basal regions
      compared to the control. Mango beverage significantly attenuated the expression
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS at the mRNA
      and protein level. Moreover, the expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was reduced,
      whereas, miR-126 was upregulated by the mango treatment. These results suggest
      that mango polyphenols attenuated inflammatory response by modulating the
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at least in part through upregulation of miRNA-126
      expression both in vitro and in vivo; thus, mango polyphenolics might be relevant
      as preventive agents in ulcerative colitis. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      cancer by attracting neutrophils.
PG  - 23920

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease confers an increased risk of developing
      colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). During the active colitis or developing
      tumor stage, commensal bacteria show dynamic translocation. However, whether
      alteration of the bacterial composition in the gut causes CAC is still unclear.
      To clarify the effect of commensal bacteria on CAC development, we employed an
      azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine CAC model
      treated with or without antibiotics. In addition, we analyzed the effects of
      antibiotics on infiltration of myeloid cells, colonic inflammatory responses, and
      colorectal cancer formation. We found that vancomycin treatment dramatically
      suppressed tumor development. In addition, AOM/DSS treatment greatly induced the 
      infiltration of Gr-1(high)/CD11b(high) neutrophils to the colon, which led to the
      production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
      Vancomycin treatment suppressed the infiltration of neutrophils induced by
      AOM/DSS. Moreover, vancomycin treatment greatly reduced the colon injury and DNA 
      damage caused by AOM/DSS-induced NO radicals. Our results indicate that
      vancomycin-sensitive bacteria induced colon inflammation and DNA damage by
      attracting neutrophils into damaged colon tissue, thus promoting tumor formation.

TI  - Colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery for obstructive colorectal cancer:
      advantages and disadvantages.
PG  - 1310-7
LID - 10.1007/s00595-016-1333-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the advantages and disadvantages of stenting as a bridge to
      surgery (BTS) by comparing the clinical features and outcomes of patients who
      underwent BTS with those of patients who underwent emergency surgery (ES).
      METHODS: We assessed technical success, clinical success, surgical procedures,
      stoma formation, complications, clinicopathological features, and Onodera's
      prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) in patients who underwent BTS and those who
      underwent ES. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent stenting, which was
      successful in 22 (BTS group). The remaining four patients with unsuccessful
      stenting underwent emergency surgery. A total of 22 patients underwent emergency 
      surgery (ES group). The rates of technical and clinical success were 85.0 and
      81.0 %, respectively. The proportion of patients able to be treated by
      laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.0001) and avoid colostomy (P = 0.0042) was
      significantly higher in the BTS group. Although the incidence of anastomotic
      leakage in the two groups was not significantly different, it was significantly
      reduced by colonoscopic evaluation of obstructive colitis (P = 0.0251). The mean 
      number of harvested lymph nodes (P = 0.0056) and the proportion of D3
      lymphadenectomy (P = 0.0241) were significantly greater in the BTS group.
      Perineural invasion (PNI) was noted in 59.1 and 18.2 % of the BTS group and ES
      group patients, respectively (P = 0.0053). OPNI and serum albumin decreased
      significantly after stenting (P = 0.0084). CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of
      stenting as a BTS were that it avoided colostomy and allowed for laparoscopic
      surgery and lymphadenectomy, whereas its disadvantage lay in the decreased PNI
      and OPNI levels. A larger study including an analysis of prognosis is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: IgG4-mediated pouchitis was first described in 2011. The
      aetiology and pathogenesis of IgG4-associated pouchitis is unknown. Over the last
      four years, less than seventy cases of IgG-associated pouchitis have been
      reported from a pouchitis clinic in Cleveland. METHODS: We report the first two
      cases of IgG4-associated pouchitis from our inflammatory bowel disease clinic and
      outside of Cleveland. CONCLUSION: This highlights the fact that this entity could
      be more common than we think. It is important for general gastroenterologists to 
      think about IgG4-mediated disease if the patient has refractory pouchitis, so
      early diagnosis and referral can be made. This would avoid the cost of expensive 
      therapy and minimize antibiotic use which is what happened in our cases prior to 
      this diagnosis being made.

      Study from Iran.

LID - 10.1080/01635581.2016.1152385 [doi]
AB  - Diet and inflammation have been suggested to be important risk factors for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). In this case-control study conducted in Iran, we
      examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict UC. This 
      study included 62 UC cases and 124 controls hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic
      diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a previously
      validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models 
      were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and the DII was analyzed as both
      continuous and as tertiles. Energy was adjusted using the residual method.
      Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e., with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a
      higher risk of UC, with the DII being used as both a continuous variable
      (OR(continuous) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.32; one unit increase
      corresponding to approximately 8% of its range in the current study) and as
      tertiles (OR(tertile3vstertile1) 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48, P(trend)| = |0.04).
      These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased 
      risk of UC.

      Equilibrium.
PG  - 217-20
LID - 10.1159/000443355 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem defined by the combination of
      microorganisms living in the gastrointestinal tract. Its equilibrium is
      intimately involved in several aspects of vital process for human physiology and 
      nutrition. Its composition changes depending on both exogenous and endogenous
      factors. The disruption of the gut microbiota by antibiotics often leads to an
      opportunistic infection by Clostridium difficile. The unbalanced intestinal
      microbiota promotes spore germination, growth of vegetative forms and toxin
      production leading to C. difficile infection, which is characterized by diarrhea 
      and possibly pseudomembranous colitis. This nosocomial infection is a good model 
      to understand the role of the gut microbiota in preventing the development of
      pathogens.

TI  - Comparison of anti-inflammatory mechanisms of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) and
      pomegranate (Punica Granatum L.) in a preclinical model of colitis.

AB  - SCOPE: Tannin-rich fruits have been evaluated as alternative prevention
      strategies for colorectal cancer based on their anti-inflammatory properties.
      This study compared tannin-rich preparations from mango (rich in gallotannins)
      and pomegranate (rich in ellagitannins) in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced
      colitis model. METHODS AND RESULTS: In rats, mango and pomegranate beverages
      decreased intestinal inflammation and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      mucosa and serum. The mango beverage suppressed the ratio of phosphorylated/total
      protein expression of the IGF-1R-AKT/mTOR axis and downregulated mRNA expression 
      of Igf1, Insr, and pik3cv. Pomegranate decreased p70S6K and RPS6, as well as
      Rps6ka2, Map2k2, and Mapk1 mRNA. In silico modeling indicated a high binding of
      docked of gallic acid to the catalytic domain of IGF-1R, which may suppress the
      activity of the enzyme. Ellagic acid docked effectively into the catalytic
      domains of both IGF-1R and EGFR. In vitro assays with lipopolysaccharide-treated 
      CCD-18Co cells using polyphenolic extracts from each beverage, as well as pure
      compounds, corroborated the predictions made in silico. CONCLUSION: Mango
      polyphenols inhibited the IGF-1R- AKT/mTOR axis, and pomegranate polyphenols
      downregulate the mTOR downstream pathway through reductions in ERK1/2. These
      results suggest that extracts rich in gallo- and ellagitannins act on different
      molecular targets in the protection against ulcerative colitis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective
      treatment for refractoryClostridium difficileinfections. However, concerns
      persist about unwanted cotransfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we
      studed FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative
      colitis patients, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments.
      Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and
      sequenced; the reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral
      genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by
      quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in
      recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a recipient 
      sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human 
      cells. Instead, viral contigs either scored as bacteriophage or could not be
      attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage. The two most frequently 
      transferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication. In
      addition, members ofSiphoviridae, the group of typically temperate phages that
      includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater
      efficiency than other groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the
      temperate-phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between
      human individuals. In summary, we documented transfer of multiple viral lineages 
      between human individuals through FMT, but in this case series, none were from
      viral groups known to infect human cells. IMPORTANCE: Transfer of whole
      communities of viruses between humans has rarely been studied but is of likely
      medical importance. Here we studied fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a
      highly successful treatment for relapsingClostridium difficileinfection and,
      potentially, other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer
      of viral communities during FMT and documented transfer of multiple viral
      lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal
      cells or that are known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage, 
      which form stable associations with their hosts, were significantly more likely
      to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate 
      replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral
      transmission between environments.

AB  - CONTEXT: Smoking whose prevalence is higher in patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      worsens its evolution. Ulcerative colitis mostly affect non- or ex-smokers;
      smoking may improve the course of the disease. OBJECTIVES: Systematic literature 
      review of data on the relationship between smoking, smoking cessation and
      Crohn'disease. DOCUMENTARY SOURCES: Medline, on the period 1980-2015 with the
      keywords "Crohn's disease" or "inflammatory bowel disease" and "smoking" or
      "smoking cessation"; limits "Title/Abstract"; the selected languages were English
      or French. STUDY SELECTION: Among 1315 articles, 168 abstracts have given rise to
      a dual reading to select 69 studies (case-control, retrospective, reviews or
      meta-analysis). Data were extracted using a reading gate. RESULTS: Smoking
      increases the risk of complications, recurrences and resort of surgery,
      corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. These deleterious effects are more common 
      in women. Stopping smoking improves the course of the disease and represents an
      essential component of its management. LIMITS: Heterogeneity of the studies
      collected according to the type, population characteristics, definition of
      smoking status and the validation of smoking cessation. CONCLUSION: Smokers
      suffering from CD must routinely be made aware of the disadvantages of smoking,
      benefits of abstinence and helped to quit smoking.

AB  - Our recent study has demonstrated that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and
      monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk
      factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the
      influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of
      fish oil in ulcerative colitis using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2
      cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl
      hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1beta induced IL-8
      synthesis, compared to the cells grown in oleic acid & hydroxytyrosol (OT)
      enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic acid,
      docosahexaenoic acid, and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 
      synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these
      lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high
      amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their
      combination with fish oil. Colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group 
      exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the
      colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body
      weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of
      MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil
      has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil
      diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT
      increase the susceptibility to colitis through oxidative damage and IL-8
      synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive 
      oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol. Combined treatment of
      hydroxytyrosol, oleic acid and n-3 fatty acids exhibit huge therapeutic benefits 
      in colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      at a high risk of malnutrition and retain an altered body composition. We
      hypothesized that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) alpha therapy may improve
      dietary intake and have a beneficial influence on body composition in these
      patients. METHODS: Our study involved 40 IBD outpatients (33 Crohn's disease, 7
      ulcerative colitis); 24 of these received adalimumab (160/80/40EOW) and 16 were
      treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and subsequently every 8
      weeks). Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis,
      while dietary intake was recorded prior to initiating biologicals and 3 months
      afterwards. Body composition indexes: fat-free mass index [FFMI], body fat mass
      index [BFMI]) were calculated in kg/m2. RESULTS: Baseline BMI (kg/m2) and muscle 
      parameters increased significantly at the end of the observational period (BMI:
      23.81+/-7.19 vs. 24.52+/-7.34, p<0.001; FFMI: 17.64+/-3.00 vs. 18.14+/-3.08,
      p<0.001; at week 0 vs. 12, respectively). However, no significant changes were
      detected in the fat parameters (BFMI: 6.21+/-5.20 vs. 6.44+/-5.27, respectively).
      We found no significant difference between the effects of adalimumab vs.
      infliximab on body composition (deltaFFMI: 0.55+/-0.82 vs. 0.43+/-0.69;
      deltaBFMI: 0.23+/-0.85 vs. 0.21+/-1.01, respectively). No significant difference 
      was observed in the extent of changes in parameters whether the patients were on 
      corticosteroids (n=15) or not (n=25) at week 0 (deltaFFMI: 0.44+/-0.84 vs
      0.59+/-0.72; deltaBFMI: 0.36+/-1.12 vs. 0.09+/-0.71, respectively). CONCLUSION:
      Our findings suggest that muscle parameters improved during the anti-TNF
      induction therapy, while fat parameters did not change significantly. Thus,
      induction anti-TNF therapy might have a beneficial effect on body composition.

AB  - Epigenetic and microbiome changes during pediatric development have been
      implicated as important elements in the developmental origins of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
      which are linked to early onset colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic mucosal samples 
      from 22 control children between 3.5 and 17.5 years of age were studied by
      Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips and, in 10 cases, by 454 pyrosequencing of
      the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Intercalating age-specific DNA methylation and
      microbiome changes were identified, which may have significant translational
      relevance in the developmental origins of IBD and CRC.

TI  - Expression of death receptor 3 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells differes in 
      adult IBD patients and children with newly diagnosed IBD.
PG  - 165-169
LID - 10.1002/cyto.b.21372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interaction between TL1A and death receptor 3 (DR3) is associated
      with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), although their role in
      the development of this disease remains not fully explained. Some studies showed 
      elevated expression of TL1A and DR3 in inflamed intestinal tissue but currently
      there are no reports concerning expression of DR3 on peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) of IBD patients which was the subject of our study. METHODS: We
      performed flow cytometry analysis of DR3 expression on CD4(+), CD8(+), CD11c(+), 
      CD14(+) or CD20(+) PBMCs of adults and children with IBD and healthy volunteers
      with respect to C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood. Blood samples were
      collected from pediatric patients before the beginning of therapy, whereas adults
      patients were undergoing anti-inflammatory IBD treatment and had much lower CRP
      levels. RESULTS: With regard to appropriate healthy volunteers, children with IBD
      had elevated percentage of DR3-expressing CD4(+), CD8(+), CD11c(+) and CD20(+)
      PBMCs which, with the exception of DR3(+) CD11c(+) cells in children with
      ulcerative colitis, was correlated with CRP level in blood. Adult patients had
      increased frequency of DR3(+) CD8(+) and CD20(+) PBMCs and their CRP levels
      correlated only with DR3(+) CD8(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to healthy
      volunteers, untreated children with IBD have higher percentage of DR3(+) PBMCs
      than adults with IBD undergoing anti-inflammatory treatment. In most of the
      investigated PBMCs populations, the frequency of DR3(+) cells is correlated with 
      the level of CRP. We suggest anti-inflammatory treatment may lead to reduction in
      the frequency of DR3(+) PBMCs. (c) 2016 International Clinical Cytometry Society.

TI  - Up regulation of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is
      associated with intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis in TNBS-induced
      experimental colitis.

LID - 10.1016/j.prp.2015.09.019 [doi]
LID - S0344-0338(15)30018-2 [pii]
AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of current smoking on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      course has been studied extensively; smoking is deleterious in Crohn's disease
      (CD), and beneficial in ulcerative colitis (UC). Except for enteral nutrition,
      there are only limited data regarding the impact of diet on disease course. KEY
      MESSAGES: Current smoking worsens the course of CD, increasing the incidence of
      flares, the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and re-operations. Conversely, 
      smoking cessation has a rapid beneficial effect on disease course, decreasing the
      risk of flares and of post-operative recurrences. From 3 months after the quit
      date, quitters have a disease course similar to that of never smokers. Achieving 
      smoking cessation in CD is thus an important goal of therapy. On the contrary,
      smoking improves the course of UC and in particular, is associated with a
      decreased need for colectomy. Smoking cessation increases the risk of flare and
      the need for steroids or immunosuppressants. However, patients with UC should not
      be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their
      disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious systemic effects of tobacco. Among 
      dietary interventions, only exclusive enteral nutrition was shown to induce
      remission and achieve mucosal healing in some patients with CD. The beneficial
      effect of liquid-defined diet is observed whatever be the type of administration 
      (orally or by tube), the type of diet regarding protein and fat content and
      resulting alterations in the gut microbiota. In UC, enteral nutrition has no
      effect. Finally, popularized restrictive diets in IBD as the
      specific-carbohydrate diet and the gluten-free diet have not been rigorously
      tested. In a small trial, a semi-vegetarian diet was shown to be effective in
      maintaining remission over 2 years in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD should
      not smoke and avoid passive smoking. Aside from the defined liquid diets, there
      is no rationale for advising particular diets.

TI  - Early Mucosal Healing with Exclusive Enteral Nutrition is Associated with
      Improved Outcomes in Newly Diagnosed Children with Luminal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1159-64
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) induction in children with luminal 
      Crohn's disease (CD) gives early mucosal healing (MH), but the long-term benefits
      of EEN-induced MH are just emerging. AIMS & METHODS: We prospectively followed an
      Australian cohort of newly diagnosed children with predominantly luminal CD who
      completed at least six weeks EEN and with paired clinical Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), biochemical (C-reactive protein; CRP) and
      endoscopic assessment at diagnosis and post EEN. All commenced immunomodulators
      (IMs) early (<3 months from diagnosis) and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up.
      Complete MH was a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of 0, and 
      SES-CD>/=1 was ascribed to active endoscopic disease (aED) and further divided
      into near complete MH (SES 1-3), mild active disease (SES-CD 4-10) and moderate
      to severe disease (SES-CD>10). The primary outcome was long-term supervised
      sustained remission (SR) on IMs alone without need for corticosteroids,
      infliximab (IFX) or surgery. RESULTS: A total of 54 eligible children (33 males) 
      completing EEN induction were analysed. The median duration between pre and post 
      EEN assessments was 60.5 days [interquartile range (IQR), 56-69.5]. Post EEN:
      clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was observed in 45/54 (83%), and biochemical
      remission (PCDAI < 10 and CRP < 5 mg/dl) was observed in 39/54 (72%). Complete MH
      was observed in 18/54 (33%), near complete in 10/54(19%). SR was superior in
      those with complete MH vs. aED; 13/18, (72%) vs. 10/36 (28%), p = 0.003 at 1
      year, 8/16, (50%) vs. 3/24, (8%), p = 0.008 at 2 years and (8/16, (50%) vs. 1/19,
      (6%), p = 0.005) at 3 years. Near-complete MH did not lead to superior SR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Only complete MH post EEN induction predicts more favourable SR for 
      up to 3 years.

TI  - Clinical course and outcomes of diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Disease in children
      10 years and under: retrospective cohort study from two tertiary centres in the
      United Kingdom and in Italy.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s12876-016-0455-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are diagnosed
      between 11 and 16 years of age, commonly presenting with features of typical IBD.
      Children with onset of gut inflammation under 5 years of age often have a
      different underlying pathophysiology, one that is genetically and phenotypically 
      distinct from other children with IBD. We therefore set out to assess whether
      children diagnosed after the age of 5 years, but before the age of 11, have a
      different clinical presentation and outcome when compared to those presenting
      later. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at two European Paediatric
      Gastroenterology Units. Two cohorts of children with IBD (total number = 160)
      were compared: 80 children diagnosed between 5 and 10 years (Group A), versus 80 
      children diagnosed between 11 and 16 (Group B). Statistical analysis included
      multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Group A presented with a greater disease
      activity (p = 0.05 for Crohn's disease (CD), p = 0.03 for Ulcerative Colitis
      (UC); Odds Ratio 1.09, 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.02-1.1), and disease extent
      (L2 location more frequent amongst Group A children with CD (p = 0.05)). No
      significant differences were observed between age groups in terms of
      gastro-intestinal and extra-intestinal signs and symptoms at disease
      presentation, nor was there a difference in the number of hospitalisations due to
      relapsing IBD during follow-up. However, children in Group A were treated earlier
      with immunosuppressants and had more frequent endoscopic assessments. CONCLUSION:
      While clinicians feel children between 5 and 10 years of age have a more severe
      disease course than adolescents, our analysis also suggests a greater disease
      burden in this age group. Nevertheless, randomized trials to document longer-term
      clinical outcomes are urgently needed, in order to address the question whether a
      younger age at disease onset should prompt per se a more "aggressive" treatment. 
      We speculate that non-clinical factors (e.g. genetics, epigenetics) may have more
      potential to predict longer term outcome than simple clinical measures such as
      age at diagnosis.

TI  - The Fate of Reconstructive Surgery Following Colectomy for Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease in Sweden: A Population-based Cohort Study.
PG  - 1165-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies describing the cumulative failure rate
      after reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease have
      been restricted to specific hospitals, and the generalizability of these results 
      in a population-based setting is unknown. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the cumulative failure rate and risk factors for failure after
      reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The 
      study cohort includes all patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Sweden who 
      underwent colectomy in 2000 through 2013 who were later treated with
      reconstructive surgery with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis or ileorectal
      anastomosis. Each patient was followed from admission for reconstructive surgery 
      until admission for failure (a diverting stoma or permanent stoma), date of
      death, migration or December 31, 2013. Cumulative failure distributions were
      obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable Cox regression models
      were used to calculate the risk of failure. RESULTS: Of the 1809 patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease treated with colectomy and reconstructive surgery, 83%
      had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 270 patients failed, and the cumulative
      failure rate was 4.1%, 13.2%, and 15.3% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.
      The risk of failure was lower after treatment with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
      than with ileorectal anastomosis [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.72
      (0.56-0.93)]. Gender, hospital volume, and timing of reconstruction were not
      significantly associated with the risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year
      cumulative failure rate in a nationwide setting was 15.3%, and hospital volume
      was not associated with the risk of failure.

AB  - We simultaneously investigated the genetic landscape of ankylosing spondylitis,
      Crohn's disease, psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis
      to investigate pleiotropy and the relationship between these clinically related
      diseases. Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of
      European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 
      27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk
      loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with
      expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and
      expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases
      were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a
      subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly
      owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive
      comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing
      cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique
      disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease 
      phenotypes.

AB  - The therapeutic effect of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and its analog (paricalcitol) on
      experimental colitis in animals has been heavily demonstrated. However, the
      response to Cholecalciterol Cholesterol Emulsion (CCE), a precursor of 1,25(OH)2 
      vitamin D3, has not yet been reported. Whether pyroptosis is involved in colitic 
      deterioration also remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted molecular biology and
      histology approaches to examine mechanisms by which CCE was able to regulate
      experimental colitis in the animal model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      acid (TNBS). Our data revealed that mice displayed a remarkable reduction in
      colonic histological scores, colonic inflammation and colonic histological
      damage. In addition, there was an overall improvement in general status (change
      in body weight, food and water intake, mental status, activity) and a 30%
      increase in survival rate due to the downregulation of pyroptosis following
      treatment with CCE. In conclusion, our data have provided evidence that CCE can
      attenuate the damage of experimental colitis by suppressing pyroptosis signaling.

TI  - High risk of drug-induced microscopic colitis with concomitant use of NSAIDs and 
      proton pump inhibitors.
PG  - 1004-13
LID - 10.1111/apt.13583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic bowel disorder characterised by
      watery diarrhoea. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and statins
      have been associated with MC. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. AIM:
      To study the association between exposure to these drugs and MC, with attention
      to time of exposure, duration, dosage and combined exposure, and to test
      hypotheses on underlying pharmacological mechanisms. METHODS: A case-control
      study was conducted using the British Clinical Practice Research Datalink. MC
      cases (1992-2013) were matched to MC-naive controls on age, sex and GP practice. 
      Drug exposure was stratified according to time of exposure, duration of exposure 
      or dosage. Conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate
      adjusted odds ratios (AORs). RESULTS: In total, 1211 cases with MC were matched
      to 6041 controls. Mean age was 63.4 years, with 73.2% being female. Current use
      of NSAIDs (AOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.49), PPIs (AOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.77-4.09) or
      SSRIs (AOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.58-2.61) was associated with MC compared to never or
      past use. Continuous use for 4-12 months further increased the risk of MC.
      Strongest associations (fivefold increased risk) were observed for concomitant
      use of PPIs and NSAIDs. Statins were not associated with MC. CONCLUSIONS: Current
      exposure to NSAIDs, PPIs or SSRIs and prolonged use for 4-12 months increased the
      risk of MC. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and PPIs showed the highest risk of MC.
      Acid suppression related dysbiosis may contribute to the PPI effect, which may be
      exacerbated by NSAID-related side-effects.

TI  - Impaired antibacterial autophagy links granulomatous intestinal inflammation in
      Niemann-Pick disease type C1 and XIAP deficiency with NOD2 variants in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1060-1073
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310382 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal lipid
      storage disorder that causes neurodegeneration and liver damage, can present with
      IBD, but neither the significance nor the functional mechanism of this
      association is clear. We studied bacterial handling and antibacterial autophagy
      in patients with NPC1. DESIGN: We characterised intestinal inflammation in 14
      patients with NPC1 who developed IBD. We investigated bacterial handling and
      cytokine production of NPC1 monocytes or macrophages in vitro and compared
      NPC1-associated functional defects to those caused by IBD-associated
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) variants or
      mutations in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). RESULTS: Patients with the
      lysosomal lipid storage disorder NPC1 have increased susceptibility to
      early-onset fistulising colitis with granuloma formation, reminiscent of Crohn's 
      disease (CD). Mutations in NPC1 cause impaired autophagy due to defective
      autophagosome function that abolishes NOD2-mediated bacterial handling in vitro
      similar to variants in NOD2 or XIAP deficiency. In contrast to genetic NOD2 and
      XIAP variants, NPC1 mutations do not impair NOD2-receptor-interacting kinase 2
      (RIPK2)-XIAP-dependent cytokine production. Pharmacological activation of
      autophagy can rescue bacterial clearance in macrophages in vitro by increasing
      the autophagic flux and bypassing defects in NPC1. CONCLUSIONS: NPC1 confers
      increased risk of early-onset severe CD. Our data support the concept that
      genetic defects at different checkpoints of selective autophagy cause a shared
      outcome of CD-like immunopathology linking monogenic and polygenic forms of IBD. 
      Muramyl dipeptide-driven cytokine responses and antibacterial autophagy induction
      are parallel and independent signalling cascades downstream of the
      NOD2-RIPK2-XIAP complex.

TI  - Association of Vitamin D Level With Clinical Status in Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease: A 5-Year Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 712-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.53 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emerging data suggest that vitamin D has a significant role in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prospective data evaluating the association of 
      vitamin D serum status and disease course are lacking. We sought to determine the
      relationship between vitamin D status and clinical course of IBD over a multiyear
      time period. METHODS: IBD patients with up to 5-year follow-up from a
      longitudinal IBD natural history registry were included. Patients were
      categorized according to their mean serum 25-OH vitamin D level. IBD clinical
      status was approximated with patterns of medication use, health-care utilization,
      biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR)), pain and clinical disease activity scores, and
      health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 965 IBD patients (61.9%
      Crohn's disease, 38.1% ulcerative colitis) formed the study population (mean age 
      44 years, 52.3% female). Among them, 29.9% had low mean vitamin D levels. Over
      the 5-year study period, subjects with low mean vitamin D required significantly 
      more steroids, biologics, narcotics, computed tomography scans, emergency
      department visits, hospital admissions, and surgery compared with subjects with
      normal mean vitamin D levels (P<0.05). Moreover, subjects with low vitamin D
      levels had worse pain, disease activity scores, and quality of life (P<0.05).
      Finally, subjects who received vitamin D supplements had a significant reduction 
      in their health-care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are common in
      IBD patients and are associated with higher morbidity and disease severity,
      signifying the potential importance of vitamin D monitoring and treatment.

TI  - Demographic and Clinical Predictors of High Healthcare Use in Patients with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 1442-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000763 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous chronic
      inflammatory condition requiring significant healthcare expenditure. Subgroups of
      individuals contribute disproportionately to spending. We aimed to determine
      demographic and clinical factors predictive of high healthcare expenditures for
      IBD patients followed over a multiyear period. METHODS: This was a registry
      analysis using a prospective observational, consented, natural history registry
      from a tertiary IBD center and associated medical charges, not including pharmacy
      expenses. The 100 patients with the highest medical charges (top 5%) were
      compared with the median 300 patients. Logistic regression determined demographic
      and clinical factors associated with high charge patients. RESULTS: IBD patients 
      in the high charge group had significantly more unemployment (P < 0.0001), were
      of black race (P = 0.013), comorbid psychiatric illness (P = 0.002), hypertension
      (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.004), opiate use (P < 0.0001), perianal involvement
      (P = 0.002), penetrating disease (P < 0.0001), and extensive colitis (P = 0.01). 
      In multivariate analysis, unemployment (Crohn's disease [CD]: odds ratio [OR],
      3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-7.02; ulcerative colitis [UC]: OR, 2.68;
      95% CI, 1.20-5.99), psychiatric illness (UC: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03-4.19),
      opiates (CD: OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 2.67-11.82; UC: OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.52-10.48),
      prior surgery (CD: OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.59-6.82; UC: OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.39-5.32),
      penetrating CD (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.02-10.62), and corticosteroid requirement
      (CD: OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.86-7.65; UC: OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.51-5.90) remained
      independently associated with high charges. CONCLUSIONS: High expenditure IBD
      patients were affected by more severe disease. The high prevalence of depression,
      anxiety, and chronic pain in these patients suggests the need for focused
      treatment of these comorbidities ultimately to reduce financial burden.

TI  - Step-up fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) strategy.
PG  - 323-328
AB  - Gut dysbiosis is a characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is
      believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) is an effective strategy to restore intestinal microbial
      diversity and has been reported to have a potential therapeutic value in IBD. Our
      recent study reported a holistic integrative therapy called "step-up FMT
      strategy," which was beneficial in treating steroid-dependent IBD patients. This 
      strategy consists of scheduled FMTs combined with steroids, anti-TNF-alpha
      antibody treatment or enteral nutrition. Herein, we will elaborate the strategy
      thoroughly, introducing the concept, potential indication, methodology, and
      safety of "step-up FMT strategy" in detail.

AB  - Secondary osteoporosis occurs as an isolated pathology or co-exists with types I 
      and II osteoporosis. The gastroenterologist may come across osteoporosis or
      osteopenia in a patient with a gastrointestinal disease. This is often a young
      patient in whom investigations should be carried out and appropriate treatment
      initiated, aimed at preventing bone fractures and the formation of the best peak 
      bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs in patients with the following conditions: Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, post gastrectomy patients, patients 
      with short bowel syndrome, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, treated with steroids
      (steroid-induced osteoporosis) and patients using proton pump inhibitors
      chronically (state of achlorhydria). It is therefore necessary to approve a list 
      of risk factors of secondary osteoporosis, the presence of which would be an
      indication for screening for osteoporosis, including a DXA study and the
      development of a separate algorithm for the therapeutic management of secondary
      osteoporosis accompanying gastrointestinal diseases, especially in premenopausal 
      young women and young men, because there are currently no registered drugs with
      proven antifracture activity for this group of patients.

TI  - Epidemiology and Long-term Outcome of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosed at
      Elderly Age-An Increasing Distinct Entity?
PG  - 1425-34
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly onset (EO) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may become a more
      common entity as a result of population aging and the rising IBD incidence. Its
      management is challenging, because of multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty. 
      Insight into the long-term outcome is essential for optimal patient counseling
      and treatment. We studied the incidence and disease outcome of elderly-onset IBD 
      in direct comparison to adult-onset (AO) IBD. METHODS: All 2823 cases with IBD
      from the Dutch population-based IBD South Limburg cohort, diagnosed between 1991 
      and 2011, were included. Long-term outcome (hospitalization, surgery, and disease
      phenotype) was compared between AO (<60 years at diagnosis) and EO (>/=60 years
      at diagnosis) disease, for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
      separately. RESULTS: In total, 1162 patients with CD (136 EO/1026 AO) and 1661
      patients with UC (373 EO/1288 AO) were included. The EO IBD incidence increased
      from 11.71 per 100,000 persons in 1991 to 23.66 per 100,000 persons in 2010, P < 
      0.01. Immunomodulators were less often used in EO CD (61.8% versus 77.1%, P =
      0.03) and EO UC (22.8% versus 35.4%, P < 0.01), even as biologicals (25.1% versus
      55.1%, P = 0.03 and 7.8% versus 18.0%, P < 0.01, respectively). No differences
      were observed in surgery risk (CD: hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.85-1.67 and UC: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.46), or in CD phenotype
      progression (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.52-1.25), but more patients with EO UC required 
      hospitalization (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63). CONCLUSIONS: EO IBD is rising,
      warranting physicians' alertness for IBD in elderly patients. The long-term
      outcome was not different from AO disease, despite a less frequent use of
      immunomodulators and biologicals.

PG  - 1219-30
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000685 [doi]
AB  - Colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia (CRN) is a well-known complication of
      chronic inflammation of the colon either with ulcerative colitis (UC) or colonic 
      Crohn's disease (CD). Studies have shown that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients have an overall higher risk for colorectal dysplasia and cancer compared
      to the general population and this risk is further increased by certain
      associated factors, including extent of disease, duration of disease, and age at 
      onset. In addition, other risk factors not related to IBD can also further
      increase the risk for CRN, such as a family history of sporadic colon cancer and 
      a concomitant diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The society guidelines
      mostly agree on the appropriate time to begin CRN surveillance but vary somewhat 
      on the appropriate intervals between surveillance colonoscopies. In addition,
      there is not yet a consensus on the appropriate method for surveillance. In this 
      review, we discuss the risk for CRN in colonic IBD, the associated factors that
      further increase the risk for CRN, the current surveillance guidelines and the
      current methods available for CRN surveillance.

LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000745 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies describing the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are uncommon in the United States. We sought to determine
      the incidence of CD and UC in the state of Rhode Island. METHODS: The Ocean State
      Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry is a state-based inception cohort of patients
      newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Rhode Island. To confirm
      a diagnosis of CD, UC, or IBD unclassified (IBDU), the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases IBD Genetics Consortium criteria were 
      applied in a review of medical records from gastroenterology practices located in
      the state of Rhode Island and adjacent to the Rhode Island border in
      Massachusetts and Connecticut. Using population-based data, we determined the
      statewide incidence of IBD in Rhode Island from 2008 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of
      971 Rhode Island residents were diagnosed with IBD, including 444 with CD, 486
      with UC, and 41 with IBD unclassified from 2008 to 2010. The overall age- and
      sex-adjusted IBD incidence was 30.2 (95% confidence interval, 28.3-32.1) per
      100,000 persons in this time frame with 13.9, 15.1, and 1.3 per 100,000 diagnosed
      with CD, UC, and IBD unclassified, respectively. Of the total incident cases in
      Rhode Island, 30% (n = 291) were enrolled in Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area
      Registry for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IBD in Rhode Island is
      higher than that previously reported by other population-based cohorts in the
      United States. Prospective follow-up of individuals enrolled in the
      community-based Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry cohort is ongoing.

      Responses to a Compromised Mucus Barrier.
PG  - 826-40
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000688 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aims were (1) to correlate changes in the microbiota to
      intestinal gene expression before and during the development of colitis in Muc2
      mice and (2) to investigate whether the heterozygote Muc2 mouse would reveal host
      markers of gut barrier stress. METHODS: Colon histology, transcriptomics, and
      microbiota profiling of faecal samples was performed on wild type, Muc2, and Muc2
      mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of age. RESULTS: Muc2 mice develop colitis in proximal 
      colon after weaning, resulting in inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, and
      expression of genes associated with human inflammatory bowel disease. Muc2 mice
      do not develop colitis, but produce a thinner mucus layer. The transcriptome of
      Muc2 mice revealed differential expression of genes participating in mucosal
      stress responses and exacerbation of a transient inflammatory state around the
      time of weaning. Young wild type and Muc2 mice have a more constrained group of
      bacteria as compared with the Muc2 mice, but at 8 weeks the microbiota
      composition is more similar in all mice. At all ages, microbiota composition
      discriminated the groups of mice according to their genotype. Specific bacterial 
      clusters correlated with altered gene expression responses to stress and
      bacteria, before colitis development, including colitogenic members of the genus 
      Bacteroides. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of Bacteroides pathobionts increased
      before histological signs of pathology suggesting they may play a role in

TI  - Risk of Incident Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Starting Anti-TNF 
      Therapy While Having Recent Malignancy.
PG  - 1362-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000741 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and history of
      malignancy within the last 5 years are usually contraindicated for receiving
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. The aim of this study is to assess 
      survival without incident cancer in a cohort of IBD patients exposed to anti-TNF 
      while having previous malignancy within past 5 years. METHODS: Data from IBD
      patients with previous malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years before
      starting an anti-TNF agent were collected through a Groupe d'Etude Therapeutiques
      des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif multicenter survey. Inclusion date
      corresponded to the first anti-TNF administration after cancer diagnosis.
      RESULTS: Twenty centers identified 79 cases of IBD patients with previous
      malignancy diagnosed 17 months (median; range: 1-65) before inclusion. The most
      frequent cancer locations were breast (n = 17) and skin (n = 15). After a median 
      follow-up of 21 (range: 1-119) months, 15 (19%) patients developed incident
      cancer (8 recurrent and 7 new cancers), including 5 basal-cell carcinomas.
      Survival without incident cancer was 96%, 86%, and 66% at 1, 2, and 5 years,
      respectively. Crude incidence rate of cancer was 84.5 (95% CI, 83.1-85.8) per
      1000 patient-years. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of refractory IBD patients with 
      recent malignancy, anti-TNF could be used taking into account a mild risk of
      incident cancer. Pending prospective and larger studies, a case-by-case joint
      decision taken with the oncologist is recommended for managing these patients in 
      daily practice.

TI  - A pilot study on faecal MMP-9: a new noninvasive diagnostic marker of colorectal 
      cancer.
PG  - 787-92
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2016.31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading malignancies worldwide,
      therefore cheap noninvasive screening methods are of great importance.
      Matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has a role in the progression of CRC, and its 
      level is elevated in tumour biopsies. Faecal MMP-9 levels are increased in active
      ulcerative colitis patients, but in CRC patients, they have never been measured. 
      We aimed to assess the faecal MMP-9 levels in patients undergoing total
      colonoscopy according to endoscopic and histological diagnosis. METHODS: One
      hundred and nine patients provided faecal samples for MMP-9 analysis. A total
      colonoscopy was performed; suspicious lesions were evaluated by histology. Faecal
      MMP-9 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The number of patients allocated to
      different groups were: negative/diverticulosis: 34 (referred to as controls);
      hyperplastic polyps: 15; adenomas: 32 (22 at high risk); and CRC: 28. Faecal
      MMP-9 was significantly increased in CRC compared with all other groups
      (P<0.001). Faecal MMP-9 was suitable to distinguish CRC patients from controls
      (sensitivity: 89.3%; specificity: 91.2%). By means of a lower cutoff level,
      faecal MMP-9 identified high-risk adenomas besides CRC (sensitivity: 76%;
      specificity: 85.3%). This lower cutoff level screened 59% of high-risk adenomas. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Faecal MMP-9 may be a promising new noninvasive marker in CRC.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

TI  - Anti-TNF Therapy Response in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Is Associated with 
      Colonic Antimicrobial Peptide Expression and Microbiota Composition.
PG  - 943-52
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy is used in
      patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], but not all patients respond to treatment.
      Antimicrobial peptides [AMPs] and the gut microbiota are essential for gut
      homeostasis and may be important for treatment outcome. The aim of this study was
      to determine AMP and microbiota profiles in patients with UC before anti-TNF
      therapy start and correlate these data to treatment outcome. METHODS: Serum and
      biopsies were obtained from UC patients naive to biological therapy [n = 56]
      before anti-TNF therapy start [baseline]. Fecal samples were taken at baseline
      and Weeks 2 and 6. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in mucosal
      biopsies. Expression of AMPs and cytokines was determined in biopsies and serum. 
      Microbiota analysis of fecal samples was performed using GA-map Dysbiosis Test
      and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction [rtPCR]. Treatment response 
      was evaluated 12-14 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, proteomic
      analysis of biopsies showed that treatment responders and non-responders had
      differential expression of AMPs. Eleven AMP and AMP-related genes were analysed
      by rtPCR in mucosal biopsies and could together discriminate responders from
      non-responders at baseline. The most important nominators for response were
      increased expression of defensin 5 and eosinophilic cationic protein. Microbiota 
      analysis revealed lower dysbiosis indexes and higher abundance of
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in responders compared with non-responders at
      baseline. Also, abundance of F. prausnitzii increased during induction therapy in
      responders. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy responders and non-responders display
      distinctly separate patterns of mucosal AMP expression and gut microbiota before 
      treatment start. This indicates that intestinal antimicrobial/microbial
      composition can influence treatment outcome.

TI  - Applicability of endoscopic indices in the determination of disease activity in
      patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 722-30

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing represents a
      major goal of different treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis (UC). This
      study aimed to assess which of the endoscopic indices used to evaluate mucosal
      changes in UC are correlated with clinical indices currently used to determine
      disease activity, as well as which of the endoscopic indices are correlated with 
      the Geboes Index used for histological evaluation. It also aimed to find
      correlations between the currently used clinical activity indices and the
      histological Geboes Index. METHODS: A group of 49 patients with a confirmed
      diagnosis of UC and a group of 52 individuals without a diagnosis of
      gastrointestinal disease, who constituted the control group, were investigated.
      All patients were evaluated by colonoscopy, and the severity of mucosal changes
      was scored in terms of nine different endoscopic indices commonly used in both
      pharmacological trials and clinical practice. Evaluation was also carried out
      using clinical and histological indices. Endoscopic indices used for UC were then
      correlated with different clinical and histological indices to find the strongest
      correlations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high correlation was demonstrated between
      three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual
      Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - 
      and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of
      Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index,
      Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index.
      Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores was the index with the highest
      correlation with all the endoscopic indices used for UC. The above indices are
      recommended for clinical evaluation of UC activity. The Ulcerative Colitis
      Endoscopic Index of Severity was moderately correlated with a histological index,
      and it is therefore recommended for routine endoscopic mucosal evaluation in
      patients with UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid;
      5-ASA) use in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). AIM: To evaluate pharmacokinetic
      and safety profiles of 5-ASA and metabolite acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) after
      once-daily, oral administration of multimatrix mesalamine to children and
      adolescents with UC. METHODS: Participants (5-17 years of age; 18-82 kg,
      stratified by weight) with UC received multi-matrix mesalamine 30, 60, or 100
      mg/kg/day once daily (to 4,800 mg/day) for 7 days. Blood samples were collected
      pre-dose on days 5 and 6. On days 7 and 8, blood and urine samples were collected
      and safety was evaluated. 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA plasma and urine concentrations were
      analyzed by non-compartmental methods and used to develop a population
      pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects (21 [30 mg/kg]; 22 [60 mg/kg];
      9 [100 mg/kg]) were randomized. On day 7, systemic exposures of 5-ASA and
      Ac-5-ASA exhibited a dose-proportional increase between 30 and 60 mg/kg/day
      cohorts. For 30, 60, and 100 mg/kg/day doses, mean percentages of 5-ASA absorbed 
      were 29.4%, 27.0%, and 22.1%, respectively. Simulated steady-state exposures and 
      variabilities for 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA (coefficient of variation approximately 50% 
      and 40%-45%, respectively) were similar to those observed previously in adults at
      comparable doses. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by ten
      subjects. Events were similar among different doses and age groups with no new
      safety signals identified. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with UC receiving
      multimatrix mesalamine demonstrated 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA pharmacokinetic profiles
      similar to historical adult data. Multimatrix mesalamine was well tolerated
      across all dose and age groups. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130844.

TI  - Lung-gut cross-talk: evidence, mechanisms and implications for the mucosal
      inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 519-28
LID - 10.1111/cea.12723 [doi]
AB  - The mucosal immune system (including airway, intestinal, oral and cervical
      epithelium) is an integrated network of tissues, cells and effector molecules
      that protect the host from environmental insults and infections at mucous
      membrane surfaces. Dysregulation of immunity at mucosal surfaces is thought to be
      responsible for the alarming global increase in mucosal inflammatory diseases
      such as those affecting the gastrointestinal (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      and irritable bowel syndrome) and respiratory (asthma, allergy and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disorder) system. Although immune regulation has been
      well-studied in isolated mucosal sites, the extent of the immune interaction
      between anatomically distant mucosal sites has been mostly circumstantial and the
      focus of much debate. With novel technology and more precise tools to examine
      histological and functional changes in tissues, today there is increased
      appreciation of the 'common mucosal immunological system' originally proposed by 
      Bienenstock nearly 40 years ago. Evidence is amounting which shows that
      stimulation of one mucosal compartment can directly and significantly impact
      distant mucosal site, however the mechanisms are unknown. Today, we are only
      beginning to understand the complexity of relationships and communications that
      exist between different mucosal compartments. A holistic approach to studying the
      mucosal immune system as an integrated global organ is imperative for future
      advances in understanding mucosal immunology and for future treatment of chronic 
      diseases. In this review, we particularly focus on the latest evidence and the
      mechanisms operational in driving the lung-gut cross-talk.

TI  - Boldine suppresses dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse experimental colitis:
      NF-kappaB and IL-6/STAT3 as potential targets.
PG  - 247-58
LID - 10.1002/biof.1267 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by
      oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration, and upregulation of
      inflammatory mediators. Boldine is an alkaloid compound found in Boldo tree, with
      multiple pharmacological actions, mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
      antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities. Hence, the effect of boldine for its 
      anti-inflammatory properties against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in
      BALB/c mice was studied. Administration of boldine to DSS-induced mice protects
      colon damage by reduced disease activity index, spleen weight, and increased
      colon length. Also administration of boldine showed a reduction in the activity
      of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD 68+ expression. Boldine reduced the colon damage,
      with significant reductions in both the extent and the severity of the
      inflammation as well as in crypt damage and leukocyte infiltration in the mucosa.
      Analysis in vivo showed clear decrease in the production of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and signal transducer and activator of
      transcription-(p-STAT3)(Y705) with nuclear factor (p65-NF-kappaB) production
      being reduced significantly. Moreover, p65-NF-kappaB activation was reduced in
      mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. The data demonstrated that boldine may
      be beneficial in colitis through selective immunomodulatory effects, which may be
      mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of p65-NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling
      pathways. (c) 2016 BioFactors, 42(3):247-258, 2016.

TI  - Clostridium Difficile Infection in Ulcerative Colitis: Can Alteration of the
      Gut-associated Microbiome Contribute to Pouch Failure?
PG  - 902-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000710 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is frequently treated with total proctocolectomy
      and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis reconstruction. Causes of pouch failure and
      criteria for improved patient selection remain poorly understood. We aimed to
      identify risk factors for pouch failure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
      chart review of patients in a prospectively maintained database. Consecutive
      patients undergoing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for inflammatory bowel disease
      between 2000 and 2010 at our institution were included. The primary outcome was
      pouch failure, defined as permanent ostomy diversion or pouch excision. RESULTS: 
      Of 417 total patients, 28 (6.7%) patients developed pouch failure. Pouch failure 
      was associated with female gender, anastomotic leak, Crohn's disease of the pouch
      and preoperative Clostridium difficile colitis. The use of anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha biologics was not associated with pouch failure. Notably, 14.9% of
      patients were diagnosed with preoperative C. difficile colitis, a factor
      independently associated with pouch failure (hazard ratio 3.02; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.23-7.44; P = 0.016). C. difficile colitis did not contribute to
      failure by increasing the incidence of anastomotic leak but was associated with a
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch (adjusted hazard ratio 2.27
      [1.08-4.79]; P = 0.031). Anastomotic leak (P < 0.001) and pelvic abscess
      requiring drainage (P = 0.031) were other independent risk factors for pouch
      failure. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to previously known risk factors, history of
      preoperative C. difficile colitis was associated with pouch failure after
      reconstruction, suggesting the need for further study into the role of the
      gut-associated microbiome in pouch outcomes.

TI  - Prediction of clinical and endoscopic responses to anti-tumor necrosis

LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1144781 [doi]
AB  - Objective In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the relationship between the 
      initial endoscopic findings and the response to anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha antibodies remains unclear. We herein evaluated the potential of
      endoscopic assessment using the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity
      (UCEIS) to predict the response to anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. Methods We enrolled
      64 patients with UC undergoing anti-TNF-alpha maintenance therapy with infliximab
      (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) between April 2010 and March 2015. Anti-TNF-alpha
      trough levels were determined by ELISA. Endoscopic disease activity was assessed 
      using the UCEIS. Results The clinical response rate at 8 weeks was 77.4% for IFX 
      and 66.7% for ADA. Serum albumin levels were significantly higher and the UCEIS
      bleeding descriptor before treatment was significantly lower in the responders
      than in the non-responders (p < 0.05 each). The CRP levels at 2 weeks were
      significantly lower in the responders (p < 0.001). The serum albumin levels
      before treatment were significantly higher and the UCEIS erosions and ulcers
      descriptor was significantly lower in the mucosal healing group than in the
      non-mucosal healing group (p < 0.05 each). A significant and negative correlation
      between the trough levels of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and the UCEIS descriptors 
      was observed. The trough levels of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies to achieve mucosal
      healing were 2.7 mug/mL for IFX and 10.3 mug/mL for ADA. Conclusions The UCEIS
      score, as well as some clinical markers (serum albumin and CRP levels), is useful
      for the prediction of the treatment outcome of UC patients in response to
      anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.

TI  - Transient inhibition of ROR-gammat therapeutically limits intestinal inflammation
      by reducing TH17 cells and preserving group 3 innate lymphoid cells.
PG  - 319-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.4046 [doi]
AB  - RAR-related orphan receptor-gammat (ROR-gammat) directs differentiation of
      proinflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and is a potential therapeutic target in
      chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, ROR-gammat-dependent group
      3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3s provide essential immunity and tissue protection in
      the intestine, suggesting that targeting ROR-gammat could also result in impaired
      host defense after infection or enhanced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that
      transient chemical inhibition of ROR-gammat in mice selectively reduces cytokine 
      production from TH17 but not ILCs in the context of intestinal infection with
      Citrobacter rodentium, resulting in preserved innate immunity. Temporal deletion 
      of Rorc (encoding ROR-gammat) in mature ILCs also did not impair cytokine
      response in the steady state or during infection. Finally, pharmacologic
      inhibition of ROR-gammat provided therapeutic benefit in mouse models of
      intestinal inflammation and reduced the frequency of TH17 cells but not ILCs
      isolated from primary intestinal samples of individuals with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Collectively, these results reveal differential requirements for
      ROR-gammat in the maintenance of TH17 cell and ILC3 responses and suggest that
      transient inhibition of ROR-gammat is a safe and effective therapeutic approach
      during intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic gastrointestinal disease
      consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both disease
      processes can share similar clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea,
      hematochezia, and weight loss; CD can also be complicated by penetrating and
      fistulizing disease. Perianal skin tags, perianal abscesses, recto-cutaneous
      fistulae, and rectal stenosis are among the phenotypic characteristics of
      perianal CD. Current treatment strategies are focused on the surgical drainage of
      abscesses and the closure of fistulous tracts as well as controlling intestinal
      inflammation with the use of immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate)
      and biologics (infliximab and adalimumab). Current guidelines by the American
      Gastroenterology Association and the North American Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommend a combination of surgical
      intervention and medical management for the treatment of perianal CD.

TI  - Perinatal vitamin D levels are not associated with later risk of developing
      pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease: a Danish case-cohort study.
PG  - 927-33
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1144218 [doi]
AB  - Objective Basic and epidemiologic studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      have suggested an association between vitamin D and IBD risk. Though, the
      literature on IBD - especially pediatric-onset IBD - and vitamin D is still in
      its cradle. We therefore wanted to examine if levels of 25(OH)D at birth were
      associated with increased risk of developing pediatric-onset IBD. Material and
      methods A case-cohort study composed of cases diagnosed with Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis or indeterminate/unclassified colitis and healthy controls.
      Cases and controls were matched on date of birth and were born in the period
      1981-2004. Cases were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. The concentration of 
      25(OH)D was assessed from neonatal dried blood spots using a highly sensitive
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated 
      using conditional logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to test for
      season and birth year 25(OH)D variations. A total of 384 matched pairs were
      included in the statistical analyses. Results No significant association were
      found between levels of 25(OH)D and IBD risk in the adjusted model (OR [95% CI]
      (per 25 nmol/L increase), 1.12 [0.88; 1.42], p = 0.35). 25(OH)D levels were found
      to fluctuate significantly with season (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001).
      Median/Q1-Q3 values for 25(OH)D were 27.1/16.5-39.5 nmol/L for cases and
      25.7/16.1-39.4 nmol/L for controls. Conclusion Our study do not suggest that a
      window of vulnerability exist around time of birth in regards to 25(OH)D levels
      and later pediatric-onset IBD risk.

TI  - The features of mucosa-associated microbiota in primary sclerosing cholangitis.
PG  - 790-801
LID - 10.1111/apt.13552 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the role of the microbiome in primary
      sclerosing cholangitis. AIM: To explore the mucosa-associated microbiota in
      primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients across different locations in the
      gut, and to compare it with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-only patients and
      healthy controls. METHODS: Biopsies from the terminal ileum, right colon, and
      left colon were collected from patients and healthy controls undergoing
      colonoscopy. Microbiota profiling using bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing was
      performed on all biopsies. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were recruited: 20 with
      PSC (19 with PSC-IBD and one with PSC-only), 15 with IBD-only and nine healthy
      controls. The overall microbiome profile was similar throughout different
      locations in the gut. No differences in the global microbiome profile were found.
      However, we observed significant PSC-associated enrichment in Barnesiellaceae at 
      the family level, and in Blautia and an unidentified Barnesiellaceae at the genus
      level. At the operational taxa unit level, most shifts in PSC were observed in
      Clostridiales and Bacteroidales orders, with approximately 86% of shifts
      occurring within the former order. CONCLUSIONS: The overall microbiota profile
      was similar across multiple locations in the gut from the same individual
      regardless of disease status. In this study, the mucosa associated-microbiota of 
      patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis was characterised by enrichment of
      Blautia and Barnesiellaceae and by major shifts in operational taxa units within 
      Clostridiales order.

TI  - Nutritional status of children with inflammatory bowel disease in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 1854-8
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i5.1854 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the prevalence of nutritional disorders in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The data from a
      national cohort of children newly diagnosed with IBD between 2003 and 2012 were
      analyzed. The diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation between Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were confirmed by gastroenterologists according 
      to the standard criteria. The body mass index (BMI) of each child [weight
      (kg)/height(2) (m)] was calculated at the time of diagnosis. The World Health
      Organization standards and references were used and the BMI for age > +1 and < -2
      standard deviation score were used to define overweight and thinness,
      respectively. Age stratification analysis was performed to investigate any
      age-related variation in the prevalence of nutritional status between children < 
      10 years of age and older. RESULTS: There were 374 children from 0.33 to 17 years
      of age, including 119 (32%) children with UC and 255 (68%) with CD. All of the
      children were Saudi nationals, and 68 (57%) of the UC and 150 (59%) of the CD
      children were males. A positive history of anorexia at the time of diagnosis was 
      found in 30 (25%) patients with UC and 99 (39%) patients with CD. The prevalence 
      of thinness was 31%, 35% and 24% in children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively,
      with a significantly higher prevalence of thinness in children with CD than in
      children with UC (P = 0.037) only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.030).
      The prevalence of overweight was 16 %, 15% and 20 % in the children with IBD, CD 
      and UC, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence in UC that was statistically
      significant only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: A high 
      proportion of children with IBD presented with overweight instead of the
      classical underweight. Awareness of this finding is important for patient care.

TI  - Elevated fecal levels of eosinophil granule proteins predict collagenous colitis 
      in patients referred to colonoscopy due to chronic non-bloody diarrhea.
PG  - 835-41
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1141432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy with biopsy sampling is often performed to detect
      collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) in patients with chronic
      non-bloody diarrhea. However, the diagnostic yield is low and incurs high costs. 
      Fecal calprotectin (FC) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) indicate intestinal
      inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In CC, elevated
      fecal levels of eosinophil protein X (EPX) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) 
      have been reported. We aimed to evaluate if F-EPX, F-ECP, FC, and F-MPO could
      predict the diagnostic outcome in patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhea
      referred to colonoscopy. We also evaluated serum (S) EPX and ECP in this regard. 
      METHODS: Of 67 included patients, 63 (94%) underwent colonoscopy with biopsy
      sampling. Fecal EPX, F-ECP, FC, F-MPO, S-EPX, and S-ECP were analyzed. RESULTS:
      Diagnostic outcome: normal: n = 46 (73%), CC: n = 9 (14%), LC: n = 4 (6%), UC: n 
      = 2 (3%), CD: n = 2 (3%). Higher levels of F-EPX and F-ECP were found in CC
      compared to a normal diagnostic outcome (p = 0.01). No change was noted in any of
      the fecal markers in LC. When all of the fecal markers were normal the
      probability of a normal diagnostic outcome was 92%. We found no differences in
      S-EPX and S-ECP between the groups. CONCLUSION: Elevated F-EPX and F-ECP could
      predict CC. None of the fecal markers predicted LC. Serum-EPX and S-ECP are not
      useful for the diagnosis of CC, LC, UC, or CD. With normal levels in all of the
      analyzed fecal markers, there is a low probability of a pathologic diagnostic
      outcome.

TI  - Oral versus intravenous iron replacement therapy distinctly alters the gut
      microbiota and metabolome in patients with IBD.
PG  - 863-871
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309940 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with IBD and oral
      iron therapy is suggested to exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an
      open-labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral (PO) versus
      intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy (IRT). DESIGN: The study population
      included patients with Crohn's disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control subjects
      with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19). After randomisation, participants
      received iron sulfate (PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical
      parameters, faecal bacterial communities and metabolomes were assessed before and
      after intervention. RESULTS: Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron
      deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with IV. Changes in disease 
      activity were independent of iron treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were
      characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower phylotype richness and
      proportions of Clostridiales. Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both 
      UC and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts in bacterial diversity 
      occurred in approximately half of all participants after IRT, but patients with
      CD were most susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in phylotypes due
      to IRT, PO treatment was associated with decreased abundances of operational
      taxonomic units assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and
      PO-specific fingerprints were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes
      affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in gut
      bacterial diversity and composition associated with iron treatment are pronounced
      in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical outcome, oral administration
      differentially affects bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared with 
      IV therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01067547).

PG  - 20318

AB  - Lactobacilli are thought to be beneficial for human health, with
      lactobacilli-associated infections being confined to immune-compromised
      individuals. However, Lactobacillus fermentum AGR1487 negatively affects barrier 
      integrity in vitro so we hypothesized that it caused a pro-inflammatory response 
      in the host. We compared germ-free rats inoculated with AGR1487 to those
      inoculated with another L. fermentum strain, AGR1485, which does not affect in
      vitro barrier integrity. We showed that rats inoculated with AGR1487 had more
      inflammatory cells in their colon, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and 
      increased colonic gene expression of pro-inflammatory pathways. In addition, our 
      in vitro studies showed that AGR1487 had a greater capacity to activate TLR
      signaling and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells. This study
      indicates the potential of strains of the same species to differentially elicit
      inflammatory responses in the host and highlights the importance of strain
      characterization in probiotic approaches to treat inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Variants in TRIM22 That Affect NOD2 Signaling Are Associated With
      Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that develop 
      in very young children can be caused by variants in a single gene. We performed
      whole-exome sequence (WES) analysis to identify genetic factors that might cause 
      granulomatous colitis and severe perianal disease, with recurrent bacterial and
      viral infections, in an infant of consanguineous parents. METHODS: We performed
      targeted WES analysis of DNA collected from the patient and her parents. We
      validated our findings by a similar analysis of DNA from 150 patients with
      very-early-onset IBD not associated with known genetic factors analyzed in
      Toronto, Oxford, and Munich. We compared gene expression signatures in inflamed
      vs noninflamed intestinal and rectal tissues collected from patients with
      treatment-resistant Crohn's disease who participated in a trial of ustekinumab.
      We performed functional studies of identified variants in primary cells from
      patients and cell culture. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous variant in the
      tripartite motif containing 22 gene (TRIM22) of the patient, as well as in 2
      patients with a disease similar phenotype. Functional studies showed that the
      variant disrupted the ability of TRIM22 to regulate nucleotide binding
      oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-dependent activation of
      interferon-beta signaling and nuclear factor-kappaB. Computational studies
      demonstrated a correlation between the TRIM22-NOD2 network and signaling pathways
      and genetic factors associated very early onset and adult-onset IBD. TRIM22 is
      also associated with antiviral and mycobacterial effectors and markers of
      inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, and Crohn's disease
      activity index scores. CONCLUSIONS: In WES and targeted exome sequence analyses
      of an infant with severe IBD characterized by granulomatous colitis and severe
      perianal disease, we identified a homozygous variant of TRIM22 that affects the
      ability of its product to regulate NOD2. Combined computational and functional
      studies showed that the TRIM22-NOD2 network regulates antiviral and antibacterial
      signaling pathways that contribute to inflammation. Further study of this network
      could lead to new disease markers and therapeutic targets for patients with very 
      early and adult-onset IBD.

TI  - Advancing nutritional therapy: A novel polymeric formulation attenuates
      intestinal inflammation in a murine colitis model and suppresses pro-inflammatory
      cytokine production in ex-vivo cultured inflamed colonic biopsies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy is a viable therapeutic option for the
      treatment of Crohn disease (CD). Therefore improving nutritional therapy would
      greatly benefit CD patients. The aim of this study was to define the
      anti-inflammatory properties of a novel nutritional polymeric formula (PF) in
      comparison to a currently available standard PF. METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate 
      (DSS) was utilized to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice with mice randomized to
      receive either standard PF or novel PF in addition to control groups. Changes in 
      body weight were recorded and colonic damage was assessed histologically and
      biochemically. Additional experiments were also included where the cytokine
      response of colonic biopsies from pediatric CD patients was measured following
      exposure to standard PF or novel PF. RESULTS: DSS induced significant body weight
      loss, morphological changes in the colon, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and up-regulated colonic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein
      (MCP)-1, as well as associated histological changes. Other than histological
      damage, these inflammatory changes were reversed by both novel and standard PF.
      However, the novel PF, but not standard PF, completely suppressed TNF-alpha, IL-6
      and IL-8 levels from cultured biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Newly developed nutritional 
      formula reproducibly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in a murine model, although 
      this response was not measurably different to standard PF. However, the novel PF 
      was significantly superior in suppressing inflammatory cytokine release from
      cultured colonic biopsies. Collectively, these findings support a possible role
      for novel PF in advancing nutritional therapy for CD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Previously reported neurological complications include central and peripheral
      demyelinating disorders and neuropathies occurring months into therapy. PATIENT
      DESCRIPTION: A seven-year-old boy diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary
      sclerosing cholangitis received infliximab. Six hours following his uneventful
      infusion, he awoke with headache and emesis and rapidly became obtunded.
      Neurological examination revealed minimally reactive pupils and otherwise absent 
      brainstem reflexes. Cranial computed tomography revealed hypodense lesions in the
      cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and pons accompanied by hemorrhage. Magnetic
      resonance imaging showed diffusion restriction concerning for ischemia with areas
      of ring enhancement suggestive of inflammation. Vessel imaging was normal, and
      cerebrospinal fluid and serum studies showed only an extremely elevated level of 
      d-dimer. Echocardiogram showed depressed ventricular function but neither
      intracardiac shunt nor thrombus. Within four days he met criteria for brain
      death. Autopsy was refused. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a fulminant,
      fatal central nervous system process to occur after an initial dose of
      infliximab. The differential diagnosis includes multifocal arterial strokes and a
      devastating demyelinating process.

TI  - Heterogeneity in endoscopic treatment of Crohn's disease-associated strictures:
      An international inflammatory bowel disease specialist survey.
PG  - 939-48
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1172-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by intestinal
      strictures, which are commonly treated by endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD).
      However, available data on this area of treatment is limited. The aim of this
      study was to depict the heterogeneity of endoscopic management of CD-associated
      strictures among international CD specialists to identify common treatment
      standards. METHODS: IBD experts of the International Organization for the Study
      of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis
      Organization (ECCO), and from the Prospective Value In IBD trials (PROVIT)
      completed a web-based questionnaire to evaluate their endoscopic experience,
      practice setting, and number of EBDs performed annually. Additionally, two case
      scenarios and technical practice parameters were investigated. RESULTS: A total
      of 126 subjects from 15 countries completed the survey. The maximal length of
      dilated stricture was 4.5 +/- 1.7 cm. The most commonly used maximal balloon size
      was graded as 15-18 mm. While 87.2 % of the participants favored EBD for
      anastomotic strictures, only 58.6 % did so in the case of naive strictures. Only 
      35.7 % of physicians dilated actively inflamed strictures. Interventional
      endoscopists were more likely to dilate only clinically symptomatic strictures (p
      = 0.046). Surgeons favored surgical treatment of de novo ileocecal strictures
      compared to gastroenterologists (p = 0.026), reported a shorter stricture length 
      being amendable by EBD (p = 0.045), and more frequently used concomitant
      therapies (p = 0.001). Operator experience increased the likelihood of EBD use in
      actively inflamed strictures (p = 0.002), maximum length of stricture, and
      maximum balloon size (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EBD is a widely used treatment
      approach for stricturing CD. Individual approaches differ significantly based on 
      background of the operator, experience level, and practice setting.

TI  - Identifying Patients at High Risk of Loss of Response to Infliximab Maintenance
      Therapy in Paediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 795-804
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loss of response to infliximab resulting in discontinuation 
      of therapy is a frequent problem encountered in paediatric Crohn's disease.
      Although identifying patients at risk of failure could have important
      implications for follow-up, literature in this area remains sparse. Our primary
      aim was to identify predictors of loss of response to infliximab among patients
      who were responders to induction. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of
      non-response to induction. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with
      paediatric Crohn's disease treated with infliximab between 2000 and 2013 was
      followed until loss of response to infliximab or transfer to adult care.
      Predictors of response to induction therapy were studied by multivariate logistic
      regression. Time to treatment failure was analysed with a multivariate Cox model.
      RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-eight patients were eligible for the study. Of
      these, 196 (79%) were responders to induction (57% clinical remission and 22%
      clinical response) and 52 (21%) were non-responders. Steroid resistance was the
      only variable independently associated with primary non-response (odds ratio [OR]
      4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-12.50, p = 0.002). Thirty-one of the 196 
      responders discontinued infliximab due to loss of response after a mean of
      1.6+/-1.3 years of treatment. Predictors of loss of response were level of
      response to induction (clinical response vs clinical remission, hazard ratio [HR]
      3.74, 95% CI 1.80-7.80, p = 0.0004) and isolated colonic disease (HR 2.72, 95% CI
      1.30-5.71, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who fail to achieve clinical
      remission after induction and/or who have isolated colonic disease are at
      increased risk of loss of response to infliximab.

AB  - Numerous environmental factors have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. 
      These include smoking, diet, hygiene, drugs, geographical and psychosocial
      factors. These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against
      developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive
      or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of
      environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in
      the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of
      environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some
      factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been
      conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of
      these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents 
      and as modifiers of disease course.

PG  - 1045-66
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.1045 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal
      tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined
      pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease.
      Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD
      patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only
      improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory 
      activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are
      suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral
      and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in
      different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and 
      there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD.
      This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of
      nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its
      mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as
      therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also
      extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific
      theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about
      them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future
      perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.

PG  - 933-48
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.933 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a wide range of diseases and
      multiple forms of cancer including breast, colon, and prostate cancers.
      Relatively recent work has demonstrated vitamin D to be critical in immune
      function and therefore important in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Because vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is
      increasingly prevalent around the world, with an estimated 30%-50% of children
      and adults at risk for vitamin D deficiency worldwide, it could have a
      significant impact on IBD. Epidemiologic studies suggest that low serum vitamin D
      levels are a risk factor for IBD and colon cancer, and vitamin D supplementation 
      is associated with decreased colitis disease activity and/or alleviated symptoms.
      Patients diagnosed with IBD have a higher incidence of colorectal cancer than the
      general population, which supports the notion that inflammation plays a key role 
      in cancer development and underscores the importance of understanding how vitamin
      D influences inflammation and its cancer-promoting effects. In addition to human 
      epidemiological data, studies utilizing mouse models of colitis have shown that
      vitamin D is beneficial in preventing or ameliorating inflammation and clinical
      disease. The precise role of vitamin D on colitis is unknown; however, vitamin D 
      regulates immune cell trafficking and differentiation, gut barrier function and
      antimicrobial peptide synthesis, all of which may be protective from IBD and
      colon cancer. Here we focus on effects of vitamin D on inflammation and
      inflammation-associated colon cancer and discuss the potential use of vitamin D
      for protection and treatment of IBD and colon cancer.

TI  - Diet and nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 895-905

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions 
      between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing 
      genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play
      an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease.
      However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of 
      sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD
      development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a
      protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease
      may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the
      quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is
      recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of
      alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course.
      Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to
      supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a
      semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to
      chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications,
      patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, 
      including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and 
      vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet
      suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations
      must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the
      disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Anti-TNF Monotherapy for Crohn's Disease: a 13-year Multicentre Experience.
PG  - 516-24
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy in combination with
      thiopurine is the most effective strategy for Crohn's disease, but raises safety 
      concerns. METHODS: In a retrospective multicentre study, we investigated
      long-term outcome of patients starting anti-TNF monotherapy for Crohn's disease
      and investigated whether introducing an immunomodulator in patients losing
      response to anti-TNF monotherapy is effective for resetting immunogenicity.
      RESULTS: A total of 350 adult patients with Crohn's disease received either
      infliximab [n = 178, 51%] or adalimumab [n = 172, 49%] monotherapy. Mean duration
      of follow-up was 42 months. An immunomodulator was initiated in 53 patients
      [15%]. At last follow-up, 73.1% [n = 38] were in clinical remission [one patient 
      with missing data]. Multivariate analysis identified anti-TNF type [higher need
      for starting immunomodulator for infliximab than for adalimumab; p = 0.0058] and 
      first- vs second-/third-/fourth-line anti-TNF therapy [p = 0.014] as predictors
      of immunomodulator initiation. Among the 18 patients with available data,
      introduction of an immunomodulator was able to restore infliximab trough level
      within the therapeutic range and to induce clinical remission in 10 patients
      [55%]. Cumulative probability of remaining on anti-TNF therapy was 57.9% at 5
      years among the 297 patients not starting an immunomodulator during follow-up.
      CONCLUSION: An immunomodulator was initiated in 15% of patients with Crohn's
      disease starting anti-TNF monotherapy. Independent predictors of immunomodulator 
      initiation were infliximab use and second-/third-/fourth-line anti-TNF therapy.
      Resetting immunogenicity with an immunomodulator was effective in half of
      patients in a sub-study. Persistence of anti-TNF treatment at 5 years was
      observed in half of the 297 patients not starting an immumodulator in a real-life
      setting.

LID - 10.1016/j.cyto.2015.12.021 [doi]
LID - S1043-4666(15)30134-4 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induce
      remission in ulcerative colitis. There is however no consensus regarding the
      discontinuation of this treatment. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess
      whether clinical parameters and mucosal cytokine mRNAs in healed colonic mucosa
      can predict long-term remission in ulcerative colitis following discontinuation
      of infliximab (IFX) therapy. METHODS: The prospective Tromso Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease (IBD) Study is based on an intensified induction treatment algorithm with
      IFX to achieve disease remission. Following clinical and endoscopic remission,
      IFX treatment was discontinued, and follow-up until relapse was performed.
      Patients who achieved clinical and endoscopic remission following an induction
      course of IFX were included. Expression levels of TNF alpha (TNF), interferon
      gamma (IFNG), interleukin (IL) 6 (IL6), IL17A, IL23, and transforming growth
      factor beta (TGFB) were quantified by real-time PCR in mucosal biopsies obtained 
      at colonoscopy. Remission was defined as Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity
      Index (UCDAI) below 3, and an endoscopic sub-score of 0-1. Relapse was defined as
      UCDAI score >3 and endoscopic sub-score >1. Mucosal cytokine transcript levels
      from 20 non-IBD patients with a normal colonoscopy served as control group.
      RESULTS: Of the 45 patients included, twenty patients (44%) had normalized levels
      of mucosal TNF expression at the time of mucosal healing, whereas 35 of 42 (83%) 
      had normalized IL17A expression levels, and 31 of 36 (86%) had normalized IFNG
      expression levels. The median time to relapse was 8months (range 4-12).
      Normalization of TNF gene expression predicted 20months (1-39) relapse-free
      survival after withdrawal of IFX compared to 5months (3-7) in the group with
      elevated TNF expression. Mucosal expression levels of IL17A, IL23, IFNG, TGFB,
      IL6 did not predict long-term remission (>12months) CONCLUSION: Normalization of 
      mucosal TNF predicts long-term remission after discontinuation of IFX.

AB  - The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors (HCA1-3) are a family of G-protein-coupled
      receptors that are critical for sensing endogenous intermediates of metabolism.
      All three receptors are predominantly expressed on adipocytes and mediate
      anti-lipolytic effects. In addition to adipocytes, HCA2 is highly expressed on
      immune cells, including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and dermal dendritic 
      cells, among other cell types. The endogenous ligand for HCA2 is
      beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), a ketone body produced by the liver through
      beta-oxidation when an individual is in a negative energy balance. Recent studies
      demonstrate that HCA2 mediates profound anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of
      tissues, indicating that HCA2 may be an important therapeutic target for treating
      inflammatory disease processes. This review summarizes the roles of HCA2 on
      inflammation in a number of tissues and clinical states.

TI  - Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Among South Asians Living in British
      Columbia, Canada: A Distinct Clinical Phenotype.
PG  - 387-96
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence is increasing among
      low-risk populations. This study examined a cohort of Canadian South Asian (SA)
      children with IBD to determine if their disease course differed from non-SA (NSA)
      children. METHODS: Children of SA ethnicity diagnosed with IBD between 1997 and
      2012 were identified and compared with NSA children. Data on duration and the
      type of presenting symptoms, disease phenotype, corticosteroid exposure (CS),
      exclusive enteral nutrition use, time to commencement of immunomodulator (IM),
      biologic therapy, and surgical intervention were extracted. RESULTS: Overall, 160
      SA children were identified and compared with 783 NSA patients (Crohn's disease
      [CD]: 44% versus 72%; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 43% versus 21%; IBD-Unclassified: 
      13% versus 7%; P < 0.001). SA patients were predominantly second-generation
      Canadians (92%) and had shorter symptom duration (2 versus 4 months; P < 0.001). 
      SA CD patients were less likely to have a parent with IBD (1% versus 14%; P =
      0.003). SA patients had more extensive colonic disease (CD: 55% versus 35%; P =
      0.005; UC: 77% versus 58%; P = 0.006); SA CD patients presented with more
      complicated disease (B2/B3: 39% versus 27%; P = 0.006) and UC patients presented 
      with more severe disease (49% versus 23%; P < 0.001). In SA CD patients, CS use
      was higher (70% versus 58%; P = 0.045), and IM and biologic therapy were
      commenced earlier (P = 0.027; P = 0.047). SA UC patients were more likely to need
      CS and IM (P = 0.024; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data describe an ethnically 
      unique clinical phenotype, where SA children have a higher proportion of UC,
      shorter symptom duration, more extensive colonic disease, and are more likely to 
      require earlier escalation of therapy.

TI  - Western diet induces a shift in microbiota composition enhancing susceptibility
      to Adherent-Invasive E. coli infection and intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 19032
LID - 10.1038/srep19032 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
      involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
      environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
      countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
      century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
      micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
      an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
      in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
      overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
      protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
      expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
      diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
      treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
      Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
      increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
      that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
      activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
      CD patients.

TI  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 has a high capacity to induce IL-10 in human 
      and murine dendritic cells and modulates T cell responses.
PG  - 18507
LID - 10.1038/srep18507 [doi]
AB  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strain A2-165 was previously reported to have
      anti-inflammatory properties and prevent colitis in a TNBS model. We compared the
      immunomodulatory properties of strain A2-165 to four different F. prausnitzii
      isolates and eight abundant intestinal commensals using human dendritic cells
      (DCs) and mouse BMDCs in vitro. Principal component analysis revealed that the
      cytokine response to F. prausnitzii A2-165 is distinct from the other strains in 
      eliciting high amounts of IL-10 secretion. The mouse DNBS model of relapsing IBD 
      was used to compare the protective effects of F. prausnitzii A2-165 and
      Clostridium hathewayi, a low secretor of IL-10, on the Th1-driven inflammatory
      response to DNBS; attenuation of disease parameters was only observed with F.
      prausnitzii. In an in vivo mouse model of nasal tolerance to ovalbumin, F.
      prausnitzii A2-165 enhanced ovalbumin-specific T cell proliferation and reduced
      the proportion of IFN-gamma(+) T cells in CLNs. Similarly, in vitro F.
      prausnitzii A2-165 stimulated BMDCs increased ovalbumin-specific T cell
      proliferation and reduced the number of IFN-gamma(+) T cells. These mechanisms
      may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in colitis and 
      support the notion that this abundant bacterium might contribute to immune
      homeostasis in the intestine via its anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  - Corticosteroid Use in a Prospective, Community-Based Cohort of Newly Diagnosed
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
PG  - 1635-40
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-4010-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids (CS) are a mainstay of treatment for
      patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous
      population-based studies report CS exposure rates range from 39 to 75 % within
      the first year of diagnosis with surgical resection rates as high as 13-18 % in
      the same time frame. These reports represent an older cohort of patients enrolled
      over prolonged periods of time and do not necessarily reflect current treatment
      approaches. We examine CS use during the first year of IBD diagnosis in a
      community-based, inception cohort. METHODS: Data were derived from the Ocean
      State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), a prospective inception cohort 
      of IBD patients who are residents of Rhode Island. RESULTS: A total of 272
      patients were included in the current analyses. Overall, 60 % of Crohn's disease 
      and 57 % of ulcerative colitis patients were exposed to at least one course of CS
      during year 1 of study enrollment. Most notably, only 2 % of patients (n = 5)
      required a surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort, 59 % 
      of patients were exposed to at least one course of CS during their first year of 
      enrollment. In contrast to previous studies, OSCCAR represents a more modern
      cohort of patients. While steroid exposure rates were similar or slightly higher 
      than those in previous reports, we observed a low rate of surgical resection. As 
      our cohort ages, future analysis will focus on the role more contemporary agents 
      may play on the low rates of surgery we observed.

TI  - Switching Between Infliximab Originator and Biosimilar in Paediatric Patients
      with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Preliminary Observations.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
      children necessitates the use of biological treatments. Recently, an infliximab
      biosimilar was authorized in the European Union, which may result in switching
      patients. We present our preliminary experiences with such switches. METHODS: The
      prospective study included 32 paediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease 
      (CD) and 7 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) at 3 academic hospitals, who
      were switched from infliximab originator to its biosimilar (Remsima). Patient
      characteristics, disease severity, laboratory parameters and adverse events were 
      recorded. Means, medians and ranges were calculated. RESULTS: Mean age at
      diagnosis of CD and UC was 11.1 (2.7-15.3) and 12.3 years (8.5-14.8),
      respectively. Mean number of infliximab originator infusions before switching to 
      the biosimilar was 9.9 (median 8, range 4-29) and 5.1 (5, 1-12) for the CD and UC
      group, respectively. Evaluation efficacy of last biosimilar doses of all patients
      revealed rates of clinical remission of 88 and 57% for CD and UC patients,
      respectively. Last follow-up assessment of patients who continued with biosimilar
      therapy showed that 16/20 (80%) CD patients and all 4 UC individuals were in
      remission. One infusion reaction to infliximab biosimilar was observed in a CD
      patient, which led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of sporadic mild
      adverse events prior to and after switching did not differ significantly and was 
      consistent with the safety profile of the infliximab molecule. CONCLUSION:
      Switching from infliximab originator to its biosimilar seems to be a safe option 
      in children with CD. After the switch the biosimilar was just as effective as the
      originator.

TI  - Eldelumab [Anti-IP-10] Induction Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis: A Randomised,
      Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2b Study.
PG  - 418-28
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 [IP-10] mediates
      immune cell trafficking from the circulation to the inflamed colon and decreases 
      gut epithelial cell survival. IP-10 expression is increased in patients with
      ulcerative colitis [UC]. We report efficacy and safety results from a
      dose-ranging induction study of eldelumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to
      IP-10, in moderately to severely active UC. METHODS: A total of 252 adults with
      UC [Mayo score >/= 6 and endoscopic subscore >/= 2] were randomised 1:1:1 to
      placebo or eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8
      and every other week thereafter. The primary endpoint was clinical remission
      [Mayo score </= 2; no individual subscale score > 1] at Week 11. Key secondary
      endpoints included Mayo score clinical response and mucosal healing at Week 11.
      RESULTS: Neither eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg resulted in significant increases vs
      placebo in the proportion of patients achieving Week 11 clinical remission.
      Remission and response rates were 17.6% and 47.1% with eldelumab 25mg/kg, 13.1%
      and 44.0% with eldelumab 15mg/kg, and 9.6% and 31.3% with placebo. Clinical
      remission and response rates were higher in anti-tumour necrosis factor
      [TNF]-naive patients treated with eldelumab compared with placebo. Eldelumab
      treatment was well tolerated and no immunogenicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The
      primary endpoint was not achieved with induction treatment with eldelumab 15 or
      25 mg/kg in patients with UC. Trends towards clinical remission and response were
      observed in the overall population and were more pronounced in anti-TNF naive
      patients. Eldelumab safety signals were consistent with those reported previously
      [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01294410].

TI  - NUTRITIONAL FACTORS OF ANEMIA IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS PATIENTS.
PG  - 19-25
AB  - The study aim was to assess the relationship between nutritional markers decrease
      and hemoglobin level in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. METHODS: The
      cross-sectional retrospective analysis was performed. Data from medical records
      of 103 ulcerative colitis patients was included to analysis. Demographic
      characteristics, disease behavior, gut involvement extension, hemoglobin and
      total serum protein levels were collected. Body mass index (BMi) and fat-free
      mass index mass were collected retrospec- tively from bloimpedance analysis data.
      A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to study the relationship be-
      tween nutrition status parameters and hemoglobin level adjusted for demographic
      and diseaseTassociated characteristics. RESULTS: Prevalence of anemia in the
      sample was 37.9%. In adjusted multiple linear regression model total serum
      protein level and fat-free mass index were directly associated with the
      hemoglobin level: standardized beta 0.369 (p = 0.010) and standardized beta =
      0.509 (p <0.001) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We assume undernutrition is one of
      causative agents of anemia in UC patients. It is likely the anemia treat- ment in
      UC patient with undernutrition must be performed with nutritional support.

TI  - Rosacea in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease: A
      Population-based Case-control Study.
PG  - 680-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000644 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations are common in patients with inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs) (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]).
      Previous case reports described patients with IBD who developed rosacea. IBD and 
      rosacea are inflammatory epithelial diseases, presumably associated with changes 
      in the innate immune system. We explored the association between IBD and incident
      rosacea. METHODS: We conducted a population-based matched (1:1) case-control
      analysis on the association between IBD and rosacea, stratified by IBD disease
      duration and severity. We used data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research 
      Datalink. Cases had an incident diagnosis of rosacea recorded between 1995 and
      2013. RESULTS: Among 80,957 rosacea cases and the same number of controls, a
      history of UC was associated with an increased risk of rosacea (odds ratio [OR]
      1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.90), with the highest OR in those with
      short UC duration (OR 2.85, 95% confidence interval, 1.80-4.50 for patients with 
      <2 years of disease history). A history of CD yielded an overall OR of 1.49 (95% 
      CI, 1.25-1.77), which did not correlate with disease duration. Additional
      analyses on IBD disease severity yielded evidence for a higher risk of rosacea in
      those with higher UC and CD activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence 
      that patients with IBD may be at increased risk of rosacea (higher in UC),
      particularly during phases of increased IBD-associated gastrointestinal tract
      inflammation.

TI  - Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from
      the EPIC Study.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated
      associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks.
      METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases
      of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded
      at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios
      of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet
      score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No 
      dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when
      excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment,
      there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern
      and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68
      [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the 
      pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if
      they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high
      consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was
      associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract must balance the extraction of energy and
      metabolic end-products from ingested nutrition and resident gut microbes and the 
      maintenance of a symbiotic relationship with this microbiota, with the ability to
      mount functional immune responses to pathogenic organisms to maintain GI health. 
      The gut epithelium is equipped with bacteria-sensing mechanisms that discriminate
      between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms and regulate host responses
      between immunity and tolerance. The epithelium also expresses numerous
      nutrient-sensing receptors, but their importance in the preservation of the gut
      microbiota and immune homeostasis remains largely unexplored. Observations that a
      deficiency in the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) using intestinal 
      epithelium-specific receptor knockout mice resulted in diminished intestinal
      barrier integrity, altered composition of the gut microbiota, modified expression
      of intestinal pattern recognition receptors, and a skewing of local and systemic 
      innate responses from regulatory to stimulatory, may change the way that this
      receptor is considered as a potential immunotherapeutic target in gut
      homeostasis. These findings suggest that pharmacologic CaSR activators and
      CaSR-based nutrients such as calcium, polyamines, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and 
      oligo-peptides might be useful in conditioning the gut microenvironment, and
      thus, in the prevention and treatment of disorders such as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), infectious enterocolitis, and other inflammatory and secretory
      diarrheal diseases. Here, we review the emerging roles of the CaSR in intestinal 
      homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for gut pathology.

      colitis, who presented clinical and biological features compatible with a viral
      hepatitis. Initial serological results revealed the presence of IgM antibodies
      against many viruses, and the most likely diagnosis was viral hepatitis A.
      However, further investigations were performed and concluded to cytomegalovirus
      primary infection.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 484-94
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] experience
      a severe flare requiring steroid therapy to avoid colectomy. We performed a
      systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tacrolimus as a
      rescue therapy for active UC. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for
      relevant studies assessing the efficacy of tacrolimus for active UC. Outcomes
      included short- and long-term clinical response, colectomy free rates, and rate
      of adverse events in randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and observational
      studies. RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing high trough concentration [10-15ng/ml]
      versus placebo [n = 103] and 23 observational studies [n = 831] were identified. 
      Clinical response at 2 weeks was significantly higher with tacrolimus compared
      with placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.09-10.17, 
      p = 0.15 x 10(-3)] among RCTs. Rates of clinical response at 1 and 3 months were 
      0.73 [95% CI = 0.64-0.81] and 0.76 [95% CI = 0.59-0.87], and colectomy-free rates
      remained high at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months [0.86, 0.84, 0.78, and 0.69,
      respectively] among observational studies. Among RCTs, adverse events were more
      frequent compared with placebo [RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.20-3.37, p = 0.83 x
      10(-2)], but there was no difference in severe adverse events [RR = 3.15, 95% CI 
      = 0.14-72.9, p = 0.47]. Severe adverse events were rare among observational
      studies [0.11, 95% CI = 0.06-0.20]. CONCLUSIONS: In the present meta-analysis,
      tacrolimus was associated with high clinical response and colectomy-free rates
      without increased risk of severe adverse events for active UC.

TI  - Methotrexate Is Not Superior to Placebo for Inducing Steroid-Free Remission, but 
      Induces Steroid-Free Clinical Remission in a Larger Proportion of Patients With
      Ulcerative Colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Parenteral methotrexate is an effective treatment for patients
      with Crohn's disease, but has never been adequately evaluated in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine 
      its safety and efficacy in patients with steroid-dependent UC. METHODS: We
      performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      parenteral methotrexate (25 mg/wk) in 111 patients with corticosteroid-dependent 
      UC at 26 medical centers in Europe from 2007 through 2013. Patients were given
      prednisone (10 to 40 mg/d) when the study began and were randomly assigned to
      groups (1:1) given placebo or methotrexate (intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 25
      mg weekly) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was steroid-free remission
      (defined as a Mayo score </=2 with no item >1 and complete withdrawal of
      steroids) at week 16. Secondary endpoints included clinical remission (defined as
      a Mayo clinical subscore </=2 with no item >1) and endoscopic healing without
      steroids at weeks 16 and/or 24, remission without steroids at week 24, and
      remission at both weeks 16 and 24. RESULTS: Steroid-free remission at week 16 was
      achieved by 19 of 60 patients given methotrexate (31.7%) and 10 of 51 patients
      given placebo (19.6%)--a difference of 12.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.0%
      to 28.1%; P = .15). The proportion of patients in steroid-free clinical remission
      at week 16 was 41.7% in the methotrexate group and 23.5% in the placebo group,
      for a difference of 18.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 35.2%; P = .04). The proportions of
      patients with steroid-free endoscopic healing at week 16 were 35% in the
      methotrexate group and 25.5% in the placebo group--a difference of 9.5% (95% CI: 
      -7.5% to 26.5%; P = .28). No differences were observed in other secondary end
      points. More patients receiving placebo discontinued the study because of adverse
      events (47.1%), mostly caused by UC, than patients receiving methotrexate (26.7%;
      P = .03). A higher proportion of patients in the methotrexate group had nausea
      and vomiting (21.7%) than in the placebo group (3.9%; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      a randomized controlled trial, parenteral methotrexate was not superior to
      placebo for induction of steroid-free remission in patients with UC. However,
      methotrexate induced clinical remission without steroids in a significantly
      larger percentage of patients, resulting in fewer withdrawals from therapy due to
      active UC. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00498589.

TI  - Exercise and gut immune function: evidence of alterations in colon immune cell
      homeostasis and microbiome characteristics with exercise training.
PG  - 158-63
LID - 10.1038/icb.2015.108 [doi]
AB  - There is robust evidence that habitual physical activity is anti-inflammatory and
      protective against developing chronic inflammatory disease. Much less is known
      about the effects of habitual moderate exercise in the gut, the compartment that 
      has the greatest immunological responsibility and interactions with the
      intestinal microbiota. The link between the two has become evident, as recent
      studies have linked intestinal dysbiosis, or the disproportionate balance of
      beneficial to pathogenic microbes, with increased inflammatory disease
      susceptibility. Limited animal and human research findings imply that exercise
      may have a beneficial role in preventing and ameliorating such diseases by having
      an effect on gut immune function and, recently, microbiome characteristics.
      Emerging data from our laboratory show that different forms of exercise training 
      differentially impact the severity of intestinal inflammation during an
      inflammatory insult (for example, ulcerative colitis) and may be jointly related 
      to gut immune cell homeostasis and microbiota-immune interactions. The evidence
      we review and present will provide data in support of rigorous investigations
      concerning the effects of habitual exercise on gut health and disease.

TI  - Changes in the Abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Phylogroups I and II in 
      the Intestinal Mucosa of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Patients with Colorectal 
      Cancer.
PG  - 28-41
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000590 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii comprises 2 phylogroups, whose abundance
      in healthy and diseased gut and in conjunction with Escherichia coli has not yet 
      been studied. This work aims to determine the contribution of F. prausnitzii
      phylogroups I and II in intestinal disease and to assess their potential
      diagnostic usefulness as biomarkers for gut diseases. METHODS: Total F.
      prausnitzii, its phylogroups, and E. coli loads were determined by quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene on biopsies from 31 healthy
      controls (H), 45 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 25 patients with ulcerative 
      colitis, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 20 patients with
      colorectal cancer. Data were normalized to total bacterial counts and analyzed
      according to patients' disease location and clinical characteristics. RESULTS:
      Lower levels of both total F. prausnitzii and phylogroup I were found in subjects
      with CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) compared with H
      subjects. Phylogroup I load was a better biomarker than total F. prausnitzii to
      discriminate subjects with gut disorders from H. Phylogroup II depletion was
      observed only in patients with CD (P < 0.001) and can be potentially applied to
      differentiate ulcerative pancolitis from colonic CD. No statistically significant
      correlation between E. coli and any of the 2 F. prausnitzii phylogroups was found
      in any group of patients or by inflammatory bowel disease location. Phylogroup I 
      was lower in active patients with CD, whereas those CD with intestinal resection 
      showed a reduction in phylogroup II. Treatments with mesalazine and
      immunosuppressants did not result in the recovery of F. prausnitzii phylogroups
      abundance. CONCLUSIONS: F. prausnitzii phylogroup I was depleted in CD,
      ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer, whereas phylogroup II was specifically
      reduced in CD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii phylogroups and E. coli may help 
      to identify gut disorders and to classify inflammatory bowel disease location.

TI  - Fungal Dysbiosis in Mucosa-associated Microbiota of Crohn's Disease Patients.
PG  - 296-305
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gut microbiota is involved in many physiological functions
      and its imbalance is associated with several diseases, particularly with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Mucosa-associated microbiota could have a key role
      in induction of host immunity and in inflammatory process. Although the role of
      fungi has been suggested in inflammatory disease pathogenesis, the fungal
      microbiota has not yet been deeply explored. Here we analysed the bacterial and
      fungal composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of Crohn's disease
      patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Our prospective, observational study
      evaluated bacterial and fungal composition of mucosa-associated microbiota of 23 
      Crohn's disease patients [16 in flare, 7 in remission] and 10 healthy subjects,
      using 16S [MiSeq] and ITS2 [pyrosequencing] sequencing, respectively. Global
      fungal load was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      RESULTS: Bacterial microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was characterised by a 
      restriction in biodiversity. with an increase of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria.
      Global fungus load was significantly increased in Crohn's disease flare compared 
      with healthy subjects [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the colonic mucosa-associated
      fungal microbiota was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla.
      Cystofilobasidiaceae family and Candida glabrata species were overrepresented in 
      Crohn's disease. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Filobasidium uniguttulatum species 
      were associated with non-inflamed mucosa, whereas Xylariales order was associated
      with inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the alteration of the
      bacterial microbiota and is the first demonstration of the existence of an
      altered fungal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that fungi may 
      play a role in pathogenesis.

TI  - mTORC1 signaling and IL-17 expression: Defining pathways and possible therapeutic
      targets.
PG  - 291-9
LID - 10.1002/eji.201545886 [doi]
AB  - IL-17 mediates immune responses against extracellular pathogens, and it is
      associated with the development and pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. 
      The expression of IL-17 is regulated by various intracellular signaling cascades.
      Recently, it has been shown that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      signaling, comprised mainly of mTORC1 signaling, plays a critical role in IL-17
      expression. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding mechanisms by which
      mTORC1 regulates IL-17 expression. mTORC1 positively modulates IL-17 expression
      through several pathways, i.e. STAT3, -HIF-1alpha, -S6K1, and -S6K2. Amino acids 
      (AAs) also regulate IL-17 expression by being the energy source for Th17 cells,
      and by activating mTORC1 signaling. Altogether, the AA-mTORC1-IL-17 axis has
      broad therapeutic implications for IL-17-associated diseases, such as EAE,
      allergies, and colitis.

TI  - Use of Placebo in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Position Paper From
      ESPGHAN, ECCO, PIBDnet, and the Canadian Children IBD Network.
PG  - 183-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001024 [doi]
AB  - Performing well-designed and ethical trials in pediatric inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) is a priority to support optimal therapy and reduce the
      unacceptable long lag between adult and pediatric drug approval. Recently,
      clinical trials in children have been incorporating placebo arms into their
      protocols under conditions that created controversy. Therefore, 4 organizations
      (the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition; 
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organization; the Canadian Children IBD Network; and
      the Global Pediatric IBD Network) jointly provide a statement on the role of
      placebo in pediatric IBD trials. Consensus was achieved by 94 of 100 (94%) voting
      committees' members that placebo should only be used if there is genuine
      equipoise between the active treatment and placebo; for example, this may be
      considered in trials of drugs with new mechanisms of action without existing
      adult data, especially when proven effective alternatives do not exist outside
      the trial. Placebo may also be used in situations where it is an "add-on" to an
      effective therapy or to evaluate exit-strategies of maintenance therapy after
      long-term deep remission. It has been, however, agreed that no child enrolled in 
      a trial should receive a known inferior treatment both within and outside the
      trial. This also includes withholding therapy in children who show clinical
      response after a short induction therapy. Given the similarity between pediatric 
      and adult IBD regarding pathophysiology and response to treatments, drugs
      generally cannot be considered being in genuine equipoise with placebo if it has 
      proven efficacy in adults. Continued collaboration of all stakeholders is needed 
      to facilitate drug development and evaluation in pediatric IBD.

TI  - Novel PPARgamma Modulator GED-0507-34 Levo Ameliorates Inflammation-driven
      Intestinal Fibrosis.
PG  - 279-92
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibrosis is mainly associated with Crohn's disease and is 
      defined as a progressive and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix
      components. No specific antifibrotic therapies are available. In this study, we
      evaluate the antifibrotic effect of a novel 5-ASA analog able to activate the
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, named GED-0507-34 Levo.
      METHODS: Colonic fibrosis was induced in 110 C57BL/6 mice by 3 cycles of 2.5%
      (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium administration for 6 weeks. The preventive
      effects of oral daily GED (30 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) administration were evaluated 
      using a macroscopic and histological score and also through biological endpoints.
      Expression of main markers of myofibroblasts activation was determined in
      transforming growth factor (TGF-beta)-stimulated intestinal fibroblasts and
      epithelial cells. RESULTS: GED improved macroscopic and microscopic intestinal
      lesions in dextran sulfate sodium-treated animals and reduced the profibrotic
      gene expression of Acta2, COL1a1, and Fn1 by 1.48-folds (P < 0.05), 1.93-folds (P
      < 0.005), and 1.03-fold (P < 0.05), respectively. It reduced protein levels of
      main markers of fibrosis (alpha-SMA and Collagen I-II) and the main TGF-beta/Smad
      pathway components. GED also decreased the interleukin-13 and connective tissue
      growth factor expression by 1.89-folds (P < 0.05) and 2.2-folds (P < 0.005),
      respectively. GED inhibited TGF-beta-induced activation of both fibroblast and
      intestinal epithelial cell lines, by regulating mRNA expression of alpha-SMA and 
      fibronectin, and restoring the TGF-beta-induced loss of intestinal epithelial
      cell markers. GED treatment also reduced the TGF-beta and ACTA1 expression in
      primary human intestinal fibroblasts from ulcerative colitis patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: GED ameliorates intestinal fibrosis in dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced chronic colitis in mice and regulates major profibrotic cellular
      and molecular mechanisms.

TI  - Interleukin-6 stimulates aerobic glycolysis by regulating PFKFB3 at early stage
      of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 215-24
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.3225 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is a well-known etiological factor for colorectal cancer
      (CRC) and cancer cells are known to preferentially metabolize glucose through
      aerobic glycolysis. However, the connection between chronic inflammation and
      aerobic glycolysis in the development of CRC is largely unexplored. The present
      study investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine,
      promotes the development of CRC by regulating the aerobic glycolysis and the
      underlying molecular mechanisms. In colitis-associated CRC mouse, anti-IL-6
      receptor antibody treatment reduced the incidence of CRC and decreased the
      expression of key genes in aerobic glycolysis, whereas the plasma concentrations 
      of glucose and lactate were not affected. Consistently, IL-6 treatment stimulated
      aerobic glycolysis, upregulated key genes in aerobic glycolysis and promoted cell
      proliferation and migration in SW480 and SW1116 CRC cells.
      6-phoshofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) was the most
      downregulated gene by anti-IL-6 receptor antibody in colorectal adenoma tissues. 
      Further analysis in human samples revealed overexpression of PFKFB3 in colorectal
      adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, which was also associated with lymph node
      metastasis, intravascular cancer embolus and TNM stage. In addition, the effect
      of IL-6 on CRC cells can be abolished by knocking down PRKFB3 through siRNA
      transfection. Our data suggest that chronic inflammation promotes the development
      of CRC by stimulating aerobic glycolysis and IL-6 is functioning, at least
      partly, through regulating PFKFB3 at early stage of CRC.

TI  - Quality of Life in Swiss Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Do
      Patients and Their Parents Experience Disease in the Same Way?
PG  - 269-76
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) may impair quality of
      life (QoL) in paediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate in a nationwide cohort
      whether patients experience QoL in a different way when compared with their
      parents. METHODS: Sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were
      prospectively acquired from paediatric patients and their parents included in the
      Swiss IBD Cohort Study. Disease activity was evaluated by the Paediatric Crohn's 
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI). We assessed QoL using the KIDSCREEN questionnaire. The QoL domains
      were analysed and compared between children and parents according to type of
      disease, parents' age, origin, education and marital status. RESULTS: We included
      110 children and parents (59 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 6 
      IBD unclassified [IBDU]). There was no significant difference in QoL between CD
      and UC/IBDU, whether the disease was active or in remission. Parents perceived
      overall QoL, as well as 'mood', 'family' and 'friends' domains, lower than the
      children themselves, independently of their place of birth and education.
      However, better concordance was found on 'school performance' and 'physical
      activity' domains. Marital status and age of parents significantly influenced the
      evaluation of QoL. Mothers and fathers being married or cohabiting perceived
      significantly lower mood, family and friends domains than their children, whereas
      mothers living alone had a lower perception of the friends domain; fathers living
      alone had a lower perception of family and mood subscores. CONCLUSION: Parents of
      Swiss paediatric IBD patients significantly underestimate overall QoL and domains
      of QoL of their children independently of origin and education.

TI  - Association Between Long-Term Lipid Profiles and Disease Severity in a Large
      Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 865-71

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to an increased risk
      of coronary heart disease and stroke. Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      long-term lipid profiles in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Data of
      patients from an IBD registry who had more than one measurement of total
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were analyzed.
      The lipid profiles of IBD patients were compared to those of the general
      population according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (2009-2012). Quartiles of cholesterol or triglyceride levels in relation to
      surrogate markers of disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven hundred and
      one IBD patients [54% Crohn's disease (CD), 46% ulcerative colitis (UC)] were
      included. IBD patients had less frequent high total cholesterol and high LDL
      cholesterol (6 vs. 13 and 5 vs. 10%) and more frequent low HDL and high
      triglycerides (24 vs. 17 and 33 vs. 25%) compared to the general population (all 
      p < 0.001). Median total cholesterol levels were lower and median triglycerides
      higher in CD compared to UC (171 vs. 184; 123 vs. 100 mg/dL; both p < 0.001). In 
      the multiple regression analysis, lipid profile was independently associated with
      hospitalizations (low cholesterol) and IBD surgeries (low cholesterol and high
      triglycerides). CONCLUSIONS: Low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels
      are more frequent in IBD patients (in particular CD) compared to healthy controls
      and are independently associated with more severe disease.

TI  - IBD Genetic Risk Profile in Healthy First-Degree Relatives of Crohn's Disease
      Patients.
PG  - 209-15
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing
      inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives
      [FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional
      information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD 
      susceptibility observed in FDR. METHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related 
      FDR; n = 4997 independent CD; and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied.
      Genotyping for 158 IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was
      performed using the Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences 
      between FDR and HC cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. 
      CD and IBD genetic risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC,
      FDR, and CD cohorts. RESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC
      cohorts were strongly correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation
      coefficient 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). 
      There was a significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD
      cohorts: 0.0244, 0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each
      comparison]. There was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and
      FDR cohorts [p = 0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared 
      with FDR and HC cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison]. CONCLUSION: FDR
      of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles compared with HC.
      Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR compared with HC.
      Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping would facilitate
      better risk stratification of FDR.

TI  - Predictors of Thiopurine Treatment Failure in Biologic-Naive Ulcerative Colitis
      Patients.
PG  - 230-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3864-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thiopurines (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) have been used in
      the management of UC patients for over three decades. Nearly half of patients
      with UC treated with thiopurines fail to achieve remission or lose remission
      during treatment. Factors associated with thiopurine failure are poorly
      understood. The primary aim of our study was to investigate patient-related
      factors which are associated with thiopurine failure. METHODS: TNF-alpha
      antagonist-naive patients with histological diagnosis of UC, receiving thiopurine
      therapy, with follow-up data from 1 to 3 years were included in the study. Data
      regarding demographics, laboratory results, and disease characteristics were
      collected. The primary endpoint was failure of thiopurine therapy, defined as
      treatment with steroids, therapeutic escalation to TNF-alpha antagonist therapy, 
      or need for surgery. RESULTS: Of the 563 patients identified using ICD-9 codes,
      78 TNF-alpha antagonist-naive patients with a histological diagnosis of UC,
      receiving thiopurine treatment, were identified. Over the three-year follow-up
      period, 38 patients failed thiopurine treatment. On adjusted Cox regression, BMI 
      < 25 kg/m(2) (HR 3, 95 % CI 1.55-5.83; p value = 0.001) was significantly
      associated with thiopurine failure. Furthermore, although not statistically
      significant, there was a strong trend toward thiopurine failure among patients
      with serum albumin level < 4 g/dL (HR 1.98, 95 % CI 0.97-4; p value = 0.06),
      non-smoking status (HR 2.2, 95 % CI 0.96-5.06; p value = 0.06), and higher degree
      of colon inflammation (HR 1.49, 95 % CI 0.96-2.32; p value = 0.08). DISCUSSION:
      Our results show that low body mass index is associated with increased risk of
      failure of thiopurine treatment. Furthermore, there was a strong trend toward
      thiopurine failure among patients with low serum albumin level (<4gm/dL). These
      factors should be considered as markers of non-response to thiopurine monotherapy
      for patients with moderately severe ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Food-related Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Development and
      Validation of a Questionnaire.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors surrounding eating and drinking, such as
      enjoying food, managing restrictions, and maintaining social relationships,
      remain under-researched in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed to 
      develop and validate a food-related quality of life [FR-QoL] questionnaire to
      systematically measure these issues in the IBD population. METHODS: Following
      semi-structured interviews with 28 IBD patients, 150 potential questionnaire
      items were generated. These were ranked by 100 IBD patients, and items were
      removed based on ceiling/floor effects and high inter-item correlations [> 0.7], 
      with 41 items being retained. In total, 323 IBD patients, 100 asthma patients
      [chronic disease control], and 117 healthy controls completed the FR-QoL
      questionnaire, alongside generic and disease-specific QoL and food satisfaction
      questionnaires. Principal components analysis [PCA], construct and discriminant
      validity, and test-retest reliability were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve items were
      removed following PCA. The reduced questionnaire [FR-QoL-29] explained 63.9% of
      the variance [Cronbach's alpha = 0.96]. FR-QoL-29 correlated significantly with
      generic QoL [r = 0.697], depression [r = -0.519], anxiety [r = -0.531], and food 
      satisfaction [r = 0.701]. The FR-QoL-29 sumscores were significantly lower for
      IBD (89.5, standard deviation [SD] 28.6) than asthma [125.4, SD 24.1; p < 0.001] 
      and healthy volunteers [123.0, SD 16.5; p<0.001]. Within IBD, worse food-related 
      QoL was found in those with moderate/high disease activity [66.7, SD 22.1]
      compared with remission/low disease activity [92.5, SD 28.1]. Test-retest
      reliability was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.83, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 0.76:0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The FR-QoL-29 shows good reliability and
      validity across a range of IBD characteristics. This easily administered
      questionnaire is a useful tool in identifying poor food-related QoL and in the
      future may identify areas for intervention.

TI  - Inherited determinants of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis phenotypes: a

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been
      determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163
      susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association
      study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between
      diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries
      in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification
      system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713
      with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip
      array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic
      variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all
      known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of
      genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the
      hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative
      colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify 
      patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile.
      FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients
      (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, 
      MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up
      of 10.5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which
      changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location
      and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for 
      inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype
      (p=1.65 x 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9.23 x
      10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly
      distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could
      also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles
      who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up
      (p=6.8 x 10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders
      within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal
      Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an
      intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the 
      major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time. FUNDING: International

AB  - Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is a serious complication after liver
      transplantation. This is the first report of spontaneous resolution of HAT in
      pediatric liver transplant patients on low molecular weight heparin therapy. A
      total of 2 patients, a 26-month-old boy who presented with acute liver failure
      and required emergent liver transplantation and a 15-year-old boy with ulcerative
      colitis and autoimmune hepatitis-primary sclerosing cholangitis overlap underwent
      liver transplantation for progressive cirrhosis; both developed HAT during the
      postoperative period. They were both treated with low molecular weight heparin.
      Follow-up imaging for both patients showed resolution of HAT without evidence of 
      collateral flow.

TI  - Ocular Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Are Associated with Other
      Extra-intestinal Manifestations, Gender, and Genes Implicated in Other
      Immune-related Traits.
PG  - 43-9
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the
      role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal
      manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and
      genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those
      with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the
      NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina
      whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with
      available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic 
      data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were
      common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13),
      respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional
      non-ocular-EIM [for >/= 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with
      O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear
      polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of
      significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur
      with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally
      associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these
      results and identify additional genes.

      Disease in the USA.
PG  - 389-99
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3895-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating condition
      with high emergency department (ED) utilization. We aimed to investigate the
      utilization patterns of ED by IBD patients and measure hospitalization and
      surgical rates following ED visits. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study
      of adults with IBD listed as the primary ED diagnosis from the 2009 to 2011
      Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. The characteristics of the IBD-related ED
      visits in relation to following hospitalizations and surgeries were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Adult IBD patients constitute 0.09 % of the total ED visits. Crohn's
      disease (CD) contributed to 69 % of the IBD-ED visits. The hospitalization rate
      from ED was 59.9 % nationally, ranging from 56 % in west to 69 % in northeast.
      The most significant factors associated with hospitalization were intra-abdominal
      abscess [odds ratio (OR) 24.22], bowel obstruction (OR 17.77), anemia (OR 7.54), 
      malnutrition (OR 6.29), hypovolemia/electrolyte abnormalities (OR 5.57), and
      fever/abnormal white cell count (OR 3.18). Patients with CD (OR 0.66), low-income
      group (OR 0.90), and female gender (OR 0.87) have a lower odds of getting
      hospitalized. Age above 65 years (OR 1.63), CD (OR 1.89), bowel obstruction (OR
      9.24), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR 18.41) were significantly associated with 
      surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The IBD-related ED visits have remained
      relatively stable from 2009 to 2011. The presence of anemia, malnutrition,
      hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, fever, abnormal white cell count, bowel
      obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess during the ED visit was associated with
      hospitalization. The presence of bowel obstruction and intra-abdominal abscess
      was strongly associated with surgical intervention.

TI  - DNA Methylation Profiling in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Provides New Insights
      into Disease Pathogenesis.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous
      disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only 
      a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by
      genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic
      regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide 
      DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity. METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 
      39 controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and
      functional validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time
      polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top differentially
      methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained 
      from paediatric IBD cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were
      differentially methylated between CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were
      differentially methylated between UC cases and controls. There was considerable
      (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC
      differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was also
      significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC patients. In
      addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using pyrosequencing and found
      reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      provide new insights into differential epigenetic regulation of genes and
      molecular pathways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and activity of IBD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Determination of overweight and obesity prevalence in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      This was a multicenter retrospective study. The study group consisted of children
      with new cases of IBD diagnosed in 2005-2013 according to the Porto criteria.
      Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical
      characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define
      overweight as >/=85th BMI percentile and obesity as >/=95th BMI percentile.
      RESULTS: 675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There
      were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease 
      activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values
      than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the 
      UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76-7.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12-4.59 and 8.47% 
      CI95 5.61-12.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77-3.88, respectively); the differences were
      statistically significant (-2.44% CI95 -5.45 to 0.49 and -6.57% CI95 -10 to -3.1,
      respectively). The risk of overweight/obesity was 3.5 times higher for patients
      with UC (OR=0.272, CI95 0.14-0.49, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of
      overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed children with IBD was 8.4% and was
      higher in patients with UC than in patients with CD. The results of this study
      have shown that not only malnourished children may suffer from IBD but also
      children who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis.

TI  - Multiyear Patterns of Serum Inflammatory Biomarkers and Risk of Colorectal
      Neoplasia in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 100-5
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000587 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of
      colorectal neoplasia (CRN) presumably because of chronic inflammation. Data on
      the relationship between long-term serum inflammatory biomarkers and the
      development of CRN in UC are limited. METHODS: We performed a 5-year study
      (2009-2013) of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data of patients 
      with UC from an inflammatory bowel disease registry in relation to the
      development of CRN. Disease activity was evaluated by UC activity index and by
      serum biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin levels. A score based on the combination
      of median CRP and median albumin levels (0: both normal, 1: one of them abnormal,
      2: both abnormal) was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 773 patients with UC
      (median age 46 yr, 46.4% women) were included. Fifty-five patients (7.1%)
      developed CRN. Patients with UC and CRN had significantly higher median CRP,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelets and lower hemoglobin and albumin
      levels compared with those without CRN. The prevalence of a CRP-albumin score (1 
      or 2) was significantly higher in the CRN group (40.0% or 30.9% versus 14.2% or
      6.0%, respectively, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate logistic regression
      analysis, CRN was associated with male gender (P = 0.01), disease duration (P =
      0.04), extensive colitis (P = 0.03), concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis
      (P = 0.0003), median albumin levels (P = 0.03), and an increased CRP-albumin
      score (score 1 or 2) (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term serum inflammatory
      markers including the CRP-albumin score are associated with increased risk of CRN
      in patients with UC.

TI  - PNPLA3 148M Carriers with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Have Higher Susceptibility 
      to Hepatic Steatosis and Higher Liver Enzymes.
PG  - 134-40
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000569 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic
      relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompass Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD are often associated with extraintestinal
      manifestations affecting multiple organs including the liver. Increased levels of
      serum aminotransferases, possibly related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
      constitute one of the most frequently described IBD-related liver diseases. The
      PNPLA3 I148M substitution is a major common genetic determinant of hepatic fat
      content and progression to chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to
      investigate whether carriers of PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have higher risk of
      liver steatosis and increase in transaminases levels. METHODS: The PNPLA3 I148M
      (rs738409) genotype was performed by Taqman assays in 158 individuals from
      Southern Italy (namely, Catanzaro cohort) and in 207 individuals from Northern
      Italy (namely, Milan cohort) with a definite diagnosis of IBD. Demographic and
      clinical data and also alanine transaminase levels were collected for both
      cohorts. The Catanzaro cohort underwent liver evaluation by sonography and liver 
      stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter measurements by transient
      elastography. RESULTS: Here, we show for the first time that carriers of the
      PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have a greater risk of hepatic steatosis (odds ratio,
      2.9, and confidence interval, 1.1-7.8), higher controlled attenuation parameter
      values (P = 0.029), and increased circulating alanine transaminase (P = 0.035) in
      the Catanzaro cohort. We further confirm the higher alanine transaminase levels
      in the Milan cohort (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PNPLA3 148M
      carriers with IBD have higher susceptibility to hepatic steatosis and liver
      damage.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

AB  - The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis, has risen alarmingly in the Western and
      developing world in recent decades. Epidemiologic (including monozygotic twin and
      migrant) studies highlight the substantial role of environment and nutrition in
      IBD etiology. Here we review the literature supporting the developmental and
      environmental origins hypothesis of IBD. We also provide a detailed exploration
      of how the human microbiome and epigenome (primarily through DNA methylation) may
      be important elements in the developmental origins of IBD in both children and
      adults.

TI  - Practice Variations in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Between
      Pediatric and Adult Gastroenterologists.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different practice guidelines and consensus statements for both
      pediatric- and adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease exist. Although variations 
      in medical care among gastroenterologists are common, it is unknown whether there
      are fundamental differences between disciplines. The primary aim of the present
      study was to investigate differences in common practices across disciplines.
      METHODS: This was a prospective, questionnaire-based survey of
      gastroenterologists attending gastroenterology meetings in Israel. The
      questionnaire covered attitudes to medical resources, diagnostic and follow-up
      measures as well as therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: Overall, 120 (60%) of the
      approached adult gastroenterologists (AGs) and 49 (75%) pediatric
      gastroenterologists (PGs) completed the questionnaire. The 2 groups differed
      significantly in various practice areas. Pediatric patients are seen more
      frequently and for longer appointments. PGs tend to assess thiopurine metabolites
      (96% vs 47%) more often during treatment. There is a significant variation in
      practice between groups concerning infectious serology status and vaccinations.
      Methotrexate in Crohn patients is used more commonly by PGs (55% vs 22%).
      Long-term combination therapy of thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factoralpha 
      agents is used more often by AGs. In patients with ulcerative colitis AGs use
      oral 5-aminosalicylic acid once daily (51% vs 21%) and add rectal agents from the
      first day of treatment (72% vs 35%) more often as compared with PGs. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study demonstrates that common practices in inflammatory bowel disease
      patients differ significantly between adult and pediatric practitioners. These
      findings call for investigating the reasons for these differences and promoting
      strategies to diminish these gaps.

TI  - Perioperative Parenteral Nutrition in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      Review of the Literature.
PG  - 159-70
LID - 10.1177/0884533615594011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with
      numerous nutrition implications, including an increased risk of malnutrition and 
      various nutrient deficiencies. Surgical interventions are often necessary in the 
      treatment of IBD, and patients with IBD presenting for surgery often have
      multiple issues, including acute inflammatory processes, malnutrition, anemia,
      and infections, which may increase the likelihood of poor surgical outcomes.
      Thus, determining adjunctive treatments that may decrease postoperative
      complications is paramount. Although enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the
      preferred nutrition support modality when the gastrointestinal tract is
      accessible and functional, parenteral nutrition (PN) may provide a suitable
      alternative when the use of EN is not feasible. The aim of this review is to
      evaluate the currently available literature on the impact of perioperative PN on 
      postoperative complications, disease severity, and nutrition status in adults
      with IBD. Six studies within the past 10 years investigated this topic and are
      analyzed here. Results indicate general trends toward improvements in
      postoperative outcomes, disease severity, and nutrition status associated with
      perioperative PN use. Although results appear promising, additional, larger
      studies with an emphasis on PN composition will improve our understanding of the 
      benefits of perioperative PN in adults with IBD.

TI  - Abdominal X-ray in Pediatric Acute Severe Colitis and Radiographic Predictors of 
      Response to Intravenous Steroids.
PG  - 259-63
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000910 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal x-ray (AXR) can identify complications in acute severe
      colitis (ASC) and may assist in selecting high-risk children for early aggressive
      treatment. We aimed to describe AXR findings in pediatric ASC and to explore
      radiological predictors of response to intravenous corticosteroid (IVCS) therapy.
      METHODS: A total of 56 children with ASC were included in a multicenter,
      retrospective 1-year cohort study (41% boys, mean age 12.1 +/- 4.2). Radiographs 
      of responders to IVCS and those requiring second-line salvage therapy by
      discharge were analyzed independently by 2 blinded radiologists. RESULTS: A total
      of 33 responders to IVCS were compared with 23 nonresponders. The day-3 Pediatric
      Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score was significantly higher in
      nonresponders (63 +/- 16 vs 46 +/- 21, P = 0.001). The mean transverse colon
      luminal diameter was 30 +/- 16 mm in responders and 38 +/- 16 mm in nonresponders
      (P = 0.94). The upper range of transverse colonic diameter in children <12 years 
      was approximately 40 mm, whereas in older children it was 60 mm as accepted in
      adults. Ulcerations and megacolon seen on AXR were associated with nonresponse to
      IVCS (P = 0.006 and 0.064, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mucosal
      ulcerations and megacolon on AXR could be considered in the risk stratification
      of children with ASC for early aggressive treatment, together with the previously
      known day-3 and day-5 Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index scores,
      albumin, and C-reactive protein.

TI  - The association of autoimmune diseases with pediatric ulcerative colitis does not
      influence its disease course.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1058415 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition. Previous 
      reports suggested that UC may have a worse prognosis when associated with
      auto-immune diseases. We compared characteristics at diagnosis and natural
      history of the disease between classical ulcerative colitis (CUC) and UC
      associated with auto-immune diseases (CAI) in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 
      this study, 67 children followed for UC at Nancy University Hospital between 1993
      and 2012 were included: 45 patients in the CUC group and 22 in the CAI group.
      RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.8 years. Median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years
      in the CAI group and 9.8 years in the CUC group. Time between symptoms onset and 
      diagnosis was broadly similar in the two groups (<3 months) and there were no
      significant differences regarding biological and histological findings. At 5
      years, the need for corticosteroids and azathioprine did not differ between the
      CAI and the CUC groups. There was also no significant difference between the two 
      groups regarding infliximab use at 1 and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric 
      study, CAI had similar characteristics at baseline as CUC. The course of CAI does
      not seem to be influenced by the presence of concomitant auto-immune diseases.

TI  - Macrophage and dendritic cell subsets in IBD: ALDH+ cells are reduced in colon
      tissue of patients with ulcerative colitis regardless of inflammation.
PG  - 171-82
LID - 10.1038/mi.2015.48 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and
      macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized 
      DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in
      clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites.
      Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total
      CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including 
      CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In 
      MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and
      CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC,
      particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. 
      The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
      activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease
      and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In
      contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors 
      was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that
      ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether
      the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal
      environment.

PG  - 175-88

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, including eosinophilic esophagitis,
      gastroenteritis, and colitis, refer to a spectrum of clinical diseases that
      present with variable degrees of infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract by
      eosinophils in the absence of other known causes of tissue eosinophilia. Clinical
      symptoms and laboratory findings are usually non-specific and may or may not be
      accompanied by peripheral blood eosinophilia. The extent of eosinophilic
      infiltration of the gastrointestinal wall varies from mucosal to transmural and
      serosal involvement. Diagnosis requires presence of gastrointestinal symptoms,
      demonstration of gastrointestinal eosinophilia by biopsy, and exclusion of other 
      known causes of tissue eosinophilia. Many studies have pointed toward the
      eosinophil as the major offender; however, the exact functional role of the
      eosinophil in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders remains
      unclear. The roles of T-helper-2 cytokines and other mediators, such as eotaxin-1
      and interleukin-5, have gained significant importance in the pathobiology of
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Current understanding of treatment is
      based on case reports and a few case series, as there is a lack of large
      prospective studies. Steroids are currently the mainstay of therapy, but the
      roles of other drugs such as leukotriene inhibitors, mast cell stabilizers,
      interleukin-5 inhibitors, and anti-immunoglobulin E, along with other targets in 
      the immune pathway, are currently being explored.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

AB  - The Asia Pacific Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease was established in
      Cebu, Philippines, at the Asia Pacific Digestive Week conference in 2006 under
      the auspices of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) with
      the goal of developing best management practices, coordinating research and
      raising awareness of IBD in the region. The consensus group previously published 
      recommendations for the diagnosis and management of ulcerative colitis (UC) with 
      specific relevance to the Asia-Pacific region. The present consensus statements
      were developed following a similar process to address the epidemiology, diagnosis
      and management of Crohn's disease (CD). The goals of these statements are to pool
      the pertinent literature specifically highlighting relevant data and conditions
      in the Asia-Pacific region relating to the economy, health systems, background
      infectious diseases, differential diagnoses and treatment availability. It does
      not intend to be all-comprehensive and future revisions are likely to be required
      in this ever-changing field.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was previously thought to be rare in Asia, but

      specific relevance to the Asia-Pacific region. The present consensus statements
      were developed following a similar process to address the epidemiology,
      diagnosis, and management of Crohn's disease. The goals of these statements are
      to pool the pertinent literature specifically highlighting relevant data and

TI  - Developing in vitro expanded CD45RA+ regulatory T cells as an adoptive cell
      therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 584-94
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thymus-derived regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate dominant
      peripheral tolerance and treat experimental colitis. Tregs can be expanded from
      patient blood and were safely used in recent phase 1 studies in graft versus host
      disease and type 1 diabetes. Treg cell therapy is also conceptually attractive
      for Crohn's disease (CD). However, barriers exist to this approach. The stability
      of Tregs expanded from Crohn's blood is unknown. The potential for adoptively
      transferred Tregs to express interleukin-17 and exacerbate Crohn's lesions is of 
      concern. Mucosal T cells are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression in active CD.
      The capacity for expanded Tregs to home to gut and lymphoid tissue is unknown.
      METHODS: To define the optimum population for Treg cell therapy in CD,
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(-) Treg subsets 
      were isolated from patients' blood and expanded in vitro using a workflow that
      can be readily transferred to a good manufacturing practice background. RESULTS: 
      Tregs can be expanded from the blood of patients with CD to potential target dose
      within 22-24 days. Expanded CD45RA(+) Tregs have an epigenetically stable FOXP3
      locus and do not convert to a Th17 phenotype in vitro, in contrast to CD45RA(-)
      Tregs. CD45RA(+) Tregs highly express alpha4beta7 integrin, CD62L and CC motif
      receptor 7 (CCR7). CD45RA(+) Tregs also home to human small bowel in a C.B-17
      severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) xenotransplant model. Importantly, in
      vitro expansion enhances the suppressive ability of CD45RA(+) Tregs. These cells 
      also suppress activation of lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes 
      isolated from inflamed Crohn's mucosa. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) Tregs may be the most appropriate population from
      which to expand Tregs for autologous Treg therapy for CD, paving the way for
      future clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methyl donor deficiency (MDD) aggravates experimental colitis in rats
      and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through decreased sirtuin 1
      (SIRT1) in neuronal cells and myocardium. ER stress plays a key role in IBD
      pathogenesis. AIM: We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis
      resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.
      DESIGN: The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock
      factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable
      expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular
      availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were
      studied both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis
      clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, 
      with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2alpha, P-IRE-1alpha,
      activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression
      levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and
      greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones
      (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90).
      Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720)
      reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis 
      by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90.
      Immunohistochemistry showed impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic
      epithelium of patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 is a master regulator of ER
      stress and severity of experimental colitis in case of MDD. It could deserve
      further interest as a therapeutic target of IBD.

AB  - Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to
      systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a
      regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for
      clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation
      using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured 
      before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet
      interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three
      categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific
      diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that
      observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group
      compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other
      specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical
      trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and
      the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for
      having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.

TI  - National Trends and In-Hospital Outcomes of Adult Patients With Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Receiving Parenteral Nutrition Support.
PG  - 412-6
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie
      malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased
      metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies 
      of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to
      determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide
      Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among
      patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A
      multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased
      inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual
      incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and 
      among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable
      through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients
      with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors
      predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50
      years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile
      colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism,
      malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally,
      patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients
      with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a
      longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with 
      CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with
      UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.
