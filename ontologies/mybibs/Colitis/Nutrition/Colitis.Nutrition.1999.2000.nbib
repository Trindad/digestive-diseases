TI  - Observations in the blood lipid profile in patients undergoing restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 227-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ileal dysfunction, and resection or exclusion may affect intestinal
      bile acid resorption resulting in alterations in serum lipid concentration. In
      restorative proctocolectomy, the different procedures may involve the ileum in
      all three ways. AIM: The aim of the present study was to analyse possible changes
      of the blood lipid profile during the different steps of restorative
      proctocolectomy operative procedure. METHOD: There were nineteen elective
      patients on their ordinary diet and 19 emergency patients on total parenteral
      nutrition. The former group were primarily operated on with colectomy; ileoanal
      pouch and loop ileostomy while the later group had had an emergency colectomy and
      terminal ileostomy before the pouch operation. Thirty five of the patients had
      ulcerative colitis, 2 had familial colon polyposis and 1 familial cancer
      syndrome. Blood specimens were collected in the mornings with the patients in a
      fasting state. The emergency patients were on unchanged ordinary diet during the 
      preoperative period. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride were determined by
      enzymatic methods. Lipoproteins, studied only in the elective patients, were
      analysed by a combination of ultracentrifugation and precipitation. Student's
      t-test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was used for
      statistic calculations. RESULTS: Preoperatively, the emergency group had
      significantly lower serum cholesterol but not serum triglycerides values compared
      to the elective group. This finding is probably due to difference in the
      preoperative nutrition. The cholesterol levels among patients who received
      steroids in the two groups were compared and found to be significantly lower in
      the emergency group. Later, no significant differences concerning cholesterol and
      triglycerides were found between the groups. The cholesterol level was not
      significantly different in the elective group between patients who receive
      hydrocortisone and those who did not. During the period with loop ileostomy
      cholesterol was significantly lowered while the triglycerides were significantly 
      increased compared to the preoperative values of the elective group. The decrease
      of serum cholesterol levels was correlated to the length of the excluded ileum.
      During the same period alpha-lipoprotein decreased significantly and reached
      values below the normal of the reference material. Beta-lipoproteins, which were 
      subnormal already preoperatively, increased but not significantly.
      Pre-beta-lipoproteins were at the same level at all stations. At 12 months with
      functioning pouches all analysed values, with the exception of beta-lipoproteins.
      were within the normal limits set by the reference material. In the emergency
      group the patterns for triglycerides and cholesterol were similar but for the
      preoperatively depressed cholesterol values. After 12 months with functioning
      pouch the serum cholesterol and triglycerides were at the same level as for the
      elective patients. CONCLUSION: A serum lipid profile was studied in patients
      undergoing restorative proctocolectomy. Serum cholesterol and alpha-lipoprotein
      decreased and triglycerides increased when the patients had a diverting loop
      ileostomy. At 12 months after it's closure and with a functioning pouch, the
      patients had the same profile as the elective patients preoperatively, and with
      exception of beta-lipoproteins within normal limits in spite of the loss of the
      colon and the construction of a pouch of the distal ileum.

TI  - Starches, resistant starches, the gut microflora and human health.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - Starches are important as energy sources for humans and also for their
      interactions with the gut microflora throughout the digestive tact. Largely,
      those interactions promote human health. In the mouth, less gelatinised starches 
      may lower risk of cariogensis. In the large bowel, starches which have escaped
      small intestinal digestion (resistant starch), together with proteins, other
      undigested carbohydrates and endogenous secretions are fermented by the resident 
      microflora. The resulting short chain fatty acids contribute substantially to the
      normal physiological functions of the viscera. Specific types of resistant starch
      (e.g. the chemically modified starches used in the food industry) may be used to 
      manipulate the gut bacteria and their products (including short chain fatty
      acids) so as to optimise health. In the upper gut, these starches may assist in
      the transport of probiotic organisms thus promoting the immune response and
      suppressing potential pathogens. However, it appears unlikely that current
      probiotic organisms can be used to modulate large bowel short chain fatty acids
      in adults although resistant starch and other prebiotics can do so. Suggestions
      that starch may exacerbate certain conditions (such as ulcerative colitis)
      through stimulating the growth of certain pathogenic organisms appear to be
      unfounded. Short chain fatty acids may modulate tissue levels and effects of
      growth factors in the gut and so modify gut development and risk of serious
      disease, including colo-rectal cancer. However, information on the relationship
      between starches and the microflora is relatively sparse and substantial
      opportunities exist both for basic research and food product development.

TI  - [Parenteral nutrition: indications and techniques].
PG  - 652-8
AB  - Parenteral nutrition corrects for or prevents malnutrition in patients with acute
      or chronic bowel disease. Whether acute (a few days to a few weeks) or chronic (a
      few weeks to several years), there are two pathophysiological mechanisms of bowel
      disease leading to malnutrition: motricity disorders and defective absorption.
      Total parenteral nutrition has to be prescribed in three situations: occlusive
      intestinal stenosis, pseudo-obstruction with complete food intolerance,
      clinically or endoscopically severe colitis. The indication for total parenteral 
      nutrition to allow the intestine to "rest" is indicated in case of digestive
      fistulae with a high flow and for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease,
      irradiated bowel disease). In other cases, parenteral nutrition can be used as a 
      complement to poorly tolerated or quantitatively insufficient oral or enteral
      nutrition to maintain the patient's nutritional status or correct for
      malnutrition. Peripheral (<3 weeks) or central (>3 weeks) parenteral nutrition,
      like all types of nutritional support, must be complete and conducted according
      to a rigorous written protocol specific for each indication, particularly acute
      versus chronic intestinal disease, in order to avoid iatrogenic and metabolic
      risks. This goal can be best achieved by developing a nutritional team within
      each hospital. Two other important goals are to enhance the efficacy of the
      nutritional support and to avoid inappropriate prescriptions, notably for
      parenteral administration. Such an approach allows a better risk/benefit ratio
      evaluated with nutritional standards. These are the prerequisites for nutritional
      therapy to be recognized as a major discipline in medicine.

PG  - 219-22
AB  - Recent progress in laparoscopic techniques has enabled operations for various
      intestinal disorders to be performed under laparoscopic assistance. This study
      was conducted to assess the benefits of performing laparoscopic-assisted surgery 
      (LAS) in patients with Crohn's disease. LAS was performed in 24 selected patients
      with Crohn's disease, most of whom underwent ileocolic resection for ileitis
      and/or colitis with stenosis. To determine the benefits of LAS, the postoperative
      inflammatory parameters of these patients were examined and compared with those
      of 17 patients who underwent conventional open surgery. Despite giving all
      patients total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for more than 2 weeks preoperatively,
      two patients with large inflammatory masses involving enteroenteric fistulas
      required conversion to laparotomy. No laparoscopic procedure was converted for
      adhesions after previous resection or intraoperative complications. The maximum
      C-reactive protein values and body temperatures were significantly lower, and the
      time taken to normalize body temperature and leukocyte counts was significantly
      shorter in the LAS group than in the laparotomy group. LAS should be performed
      for patients with Crohn's disease in the inactive phase after appropriate
      nutritional support. Patients with terminal ileitis without a fistula are
      considered to have the highest indication for this procedure.

TI  - Pediatric parenteral nutrition in India.
PG  - S141-9
AB  - Nutritional support to patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units is
      critical not only to minimize negative nitrogen balance but also to promote
      growth and development. Continuous technological and logistical advances in the
      Western countries have improved the efficacy and reduced the complications of
      parenteral nutrition (PN) to the extent that despite the constraints of cost and 
      infrastructure, PN is now fast growing in India. Although widespread availability
      is very much desired, it is important that the technique is developed with
      considerable expertise and used judiciously with full knowledge of its
      indications, limitations, dangers and benefits. Indications for PN include
      surgical conditions (short gut syndrome), very low birth weight infants
      (particularly with necrotizing enterocolitis and surgical anomalies),
      malabsorption syndromes, conditions requiring bowel rest (acute pancreatitis,
      severe ulcerative colitis and necrotizing enterocolitis) and several
      non-gastrointestinal indications (end stage liver disease, renal failure,
      multiple trauma and extensive burns). Provision of PN is associated with
      significant and sometimes life threatening complications. The possible
      complications are technical (thrombosis, perforation of vein, thrombophlebitis), 
      infections, metabolic disturbances, hepatobiliary stenosis, cholestasis,
      fibrosis, cirrhosis or cholelithiasis and bone related complications like
      osteopenia and fractures. Meticulous monitoring is necessary not only to detect
      complications but also to document clinical benefit.

TI  - Granulomatous osteonecrosis in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 951-4
AB  - A 25-year-old white woman was diagnosed with Crohn's disease involving the small 
      and large intestines. She had a complex clinical course that required treatment
      with multiple pharmacological agents, including intravenous, oral and rectal
      corticosteroids. She also received parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsions.
      Finally, repeated intestinal resections and drainage of perianal abscesses were
      required. Her disease was complicated by gallstones, urolithiasis and hip pain.
      After osteonecrosis was diagnosed, joint replacements were performed. Review of
      the pathological sections from the resected hip, however, resulted in detection
      of granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells - the histological 
      'footprint' of Crohn's disease in the gastrointestinal tract. Because prior
      specialized perfusion fixation pathological studies of the intestine in Crohn's
      disease have shown that granulomas are located in the walls of blood vessels, a
      possible mechanism for the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis in Crohn's disease is
      chronic microvascular ischemia of bone.

TI  - Oral tacrolimus treatment of severe colitis in children.
PG  - 794-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of oral tacrolimus as an induction agent in
      steroid-refractory severe colitis. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, multicenter trial of
      oral tacrolimus in patients with severe colitis. Patients not responding to
      conventional therapy received tacrolimus, 0.1 mg/kg/dose given twice a day, and
      the dosage was adjusted to achieve blood levels between 10 and 15 ng/mL. Response
      was defined as improvement in a number of clinical parameters (including
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and cessation of transfusions).
      Patients who responded by 14 days continued to receive tacrolimus, and
      6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine was added as a steroid-sparing agent 4 to 6
      weeks after the tacrolimus was instituted. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were
      enrolled in the study. One patient elected to withdraw after 48 hours. Of the 13 
      remaining, 9 (69%) responded and were discharged. Tacrolimus was continued for 2 
      to 3 months in the responders, except for 1 patient who was given tacrolimus for 
      11 months. After 1 year of follow-up, only 5 (38%) patients were receiving
      maintenance therapy; the other 4 responders had undergone colectomy. CONCLUSION: 
      Although tacrolimus is effective induction therapy for severe ulcerative or
      Crohn's colitis, fewer than 50% of patients treated will successfully achieve a
      long-term remission.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 747-56
AB  - Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as
      non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD,
      mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is 
      also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a
      population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A 
      substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is
      reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an
      increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults.
      However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The
      etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and
      antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made
      in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the
      disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system 
      in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual.
      The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 
      4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 
      activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral.
      Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and
      nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious
      diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of
      nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations
      nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD.
      Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. 
      Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents,
      biologic agents and role of surgery.

TI  - Contribution of dietary protein to sulfide production in the large intestine: an 
      in vitro and a controlled feeding study in humans.
PG  - 1488-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell
      poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the 
      colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino
      acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the
      contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with 
      use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study.
      DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5
      diets for 10 d each. Meat intake ranged from 0 g/d with a vegetarian diet to 600 
      g/d with a high-meat diet. Fecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in
      samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet period. Additionally, 5 or 10 g
      bovine serum albumin or casein/L was added to batch cultures inoculated with
      feces from 4 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and
      Lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) fecal
      sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to
      3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to
      meat intake (P: < 0.001). Sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented 
      with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion, as
      measured by the disappearance of Lowry-reactive substances and the appearance of 
      ammonia. CONCLUSION: Dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for
      sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.

TI  - [Consensus of the Chronic Inflammatory Bowl Disease Study Group of the Austrian
      Society of Gastroenterology and Hepatology on the topic of "diagnosis and therapy
      of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases in adolescence"].
PG  - 791-4
AB  - Although up to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease have their first flare during
      childhood or adolescence, there are no or only a few randomized, controlled
      studies. However, big differences and uncertainty may be observed between the
      diagnosis and therapy of pediatricians and gastroenterologists specialized for
      adults. In addition, special problems result from the enormous somatic and
      psychological evolution during adolescence. The diagnosis is done as in adult
      patients by enteroclysm and ileocolonoscopy (including multiple biopsies) whereas
      a deep sedoanalgesia or anesthesia should be performed routinely. Corticosteroids
      are the gold standard for therapy of Crohn's disease in the adolescence
      (especially in cases with high inflammatory activity), but also enteral nutrition
      over 4-12 weeks--or a combination of both. A recent randomized controlled study
      demonstrates the positive effect of 6-mercaptopurine in newly diagnosed patients 
      with Crohn's disease in the adolescence. 5-aminosalicylates or the probably more 
      effective azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine could be used for prevention of
      recurrence in Crohn's disease. The therapy of ulcerative colitis is performed as 
      in adults including the very effective local rectal applications. An accompanying
      psychosomatic therapy is recommended especially in young patients with disturbed 
      separation from the parents and inadequate coping. The indication for surgery is 
      similar to adults. However, a specific indication for earlier surgery is given,
      if severe malabsorption and delay of growth takes place in spite of adequate
      therapy, because this delay of growth could be only caught up before puberty. A
      conservative therapeutic regimen is recommended in young patients with perianal
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Acute cholecystitis after colectomy for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 392-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many different hepatobiliary diseases have been related with
      ulcerative colitis. In this retrospective study we tried to determine whether
      colectomy involves a greater risk of postoperative cholecystitis in these
      patients than in other patients who undergo colectomy. METHODS: From 1990 to 1998
      a total of 53 subtotal or total colectomies were carried out in our hospital.
      35.8% of the operations were done for ulcerative colitis (group I), 58% for
      cancer, 1.8% for aganglionic megacolon, and 3.6% for volvular disorders (group
      II). RESULTS: In group I, 21% of the patients required reoperation because of
      postoperative acute cholecystitis. In group II there were no cases of acute
      cholecystitis. Neither parenteral nutrition nor diabetes were influential
      factors. 94.5% of the patients in group I had emergency surgery, while emergency 
      surgery was necessary in only 38.2% of the patients in group II. CONCLUSIONS:
      Acute cholecystitis after colectomy for ulcerative colitis, especially when the
      latter arises in an emergency situation, is a common complication. Although the
      sample was small, the results show that in view of the mortality from
      cholecystitis, prophylactic cholecystectomy may be necessary.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 324-30
AB  - The nutritional impact of inflammatory bowel disease is notable, both in Crohn's 
      disease and ulcerative colitis. The causes of malnutrition include decreased
      intake, maldigestion, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased
      requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. Inflammatory bowel disease causes
      alterations in body composition and, because of these changes, affects energy
      expenditure. Various approaches have been most effective in correcting
      malnutrition, supporting growth, and managing short-bowel syndrome, but the
      success of primary therapy has been limited.

AB  - Graft-versus-host disease after liver transplantation complicated by systemic
      aspergillosis with pancarditis. Can J Gastroenterol 2000;14(7):637-640. Acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication after bone marrow
      transplantation, with characteristic rash and diarrhea being the most common
      features. After liver transplantation, however, this phenomenon is very rare.
      Most transplant patients are on a variety of medications, including
      immunosuppressants; therefore, the differential diagnosis of skin rash or
      diarrhea is broad. A 37-year-old man who underwent liver transplantation for
      primary biliary cirrhosis, and developed a rash and watery diarrhea, is
      presented. Skin and colonic biopsies confirmed acute GVHD. A pulse of intravenous
      steroids was given. The skin rash improved, but he developed pancytopenia. His
      course was complicated by central line infection, jugular and subclavian vein
      thrombosis, pseudomembranous colitis, recurrent bacteremia, cholestasis on total 
      parenteral nutrition and cytomegalovirus infection. After the onset of pleuritic 
      chest pain and clinical sepsis, spiral computed tomography scan of his chest and 
      abdomen revealed septic infarcts in multiple organs. Despite empirical treatment 
      with amphotericin B, he died of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome within 72 h.
      Autopsy revealed systemic aspergillosis with pancarditis, endocardial
      vegetations, and septic pulmonary, splenic, hepatic and renal infarcts. The
      pathogenesis and experience with this rare, but often fatal, complication of
      liver transplantation are reviewed. In contrast to GVHD after bone marrow
      transplantation, pancytopenia is common and liver dysfunction is rare. One should
      have a high level of suspicion in the liver transplant recipient presenting with 
      rash and/or diarrhea.

TI  - [Total proctocolectomy with ileo-anal reservoir in "J". Experience at the
      Salvador Zubiran National Institute of Nutrition].
PG  - 327-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (TPCIAA) is
      the procedure of choice for patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Familial
      Adenomatous Polyposis. The frequency of presentation of both diseases is low in
      Mexico, therefore the experience with the surgical procedure is limited.
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the operative morbidity and mortality and long-term
      functional results in a series of patients operated upon with the TPCIAA in a
      referral center in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 44
      consecutive patients operated upon from 1987 through 1997. The operation included
      resection of the anal transitional zone, handsewn anastomosis of a "J" pouch, and
      diverting ileostomy in all cases. Operative morbidity and mortality, and
      long-term functional results and complications were determined. RESULTS: Mean age
      was 33 +/- 15 years. There were 52% women and 48% men. Diagnoses were ulcerative 
      colitis in 59% and familial polyposis in 36%. Global morbidity was 39%, and
      mortality 2%. With a mean follow-up of 24 months, mean number of bowel movements 
      was 4, 10% of patients had diurnal spotting, 30% nocturnal spotting, and no
      patient had gross incontinence. Three patients presented pouchitis with adequate 
      response to antibiotics. Two patients presented long-term pouch fistulas that did
      not require pouch excision. CONCLUSIONS: The TPCIAA is a feasible operation with 
      acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality and satisfactory functional results.

TI  - Gastric emptying rate of solids is reduced in a group of ileostomy patients.
PG  - 1285-92
AB  - Feedback inhibition from the colon acts as a potent inhibitor of gastrointestinal
      motility via an array of gut peptides and neural pathways. The effect of total
      colonectomy on gastric emptying was assessed in five healthy ileostomy patients
      (<5 cm ileal resection) and five matched controls. Each subject consumed two
      isoenergetic test meals of contrasting fat-carbohydrate ratio in random order.
      Emptying of solids was measured using the [13C]octanoic acid breath test, and
      liquid emptying was assessed after oral dosing with paracetamol. Ileostomist
      subjects exhibited an increased half-emptying time for solids (P = 0.047), which 
      included components of an increased gastric lag time (P = 0.004) and a reduction 
      in the linear emptying rate (P = 0.003). There was no difference in the pattern
      of liquid emptying between subject groups. In conclusion, the gastric emptying
      rate of solids was reduced in ileostomy patients compared with controls.

TI  - Colonic inflammation found at diagnosis of juvenile retention polyps in pediatric
      patients.
PG  - 1990-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The finding of colonic inflammation concurrently with a juvenile
      retention polyp (JRP) may have prognostic value. However, the significance of
      abnormal mucosal histology with JRP has not been evaluated. We evaluated the
      significance of mucosal histology at the time of JRP removal with respect to
      future development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and polyp recurrence.
      METHODS: The medical records of patients who had an endoscopic polypectomy
      performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) from 1/1/87 through
      4/30/98 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: JRP was histologically identified
      in 96 patients. A total of 54 patients had colonic mucosal biopsies: 30 (55.6%)
      had normal histology and 24 (44.4%) had colitis. Of the 24 patients with colitis,
      14 patients (58.3%) had inflammation at the polyp site. Twelve of these patients 
      had additional inflammation elsewhere in the colon. Nine (37.5%) had inflammation
      elsewhere in the colon; however, biopsies around the polyp site were not
      obtained. One patient with inflammation did not have the location of the polyp
      documented. Four patients (16.7%) had IBD at the time of polypectomy; two were
      diagnosed prior and two coincident with JRP. None have subsequently been
      diagnosed with IBD. There was no difference in polyp recurrence between those
      with or without inflammation (16.7% [4/24] vs 10.0% [3/30]). The mean follow-up
      period was 72.4 months (range, 5-142 months). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience,
      histological mucosal inflammation is a common finding with JRP. This inflammation
      may be a precursor for the development of JRP but has no predictive value for
      polyp recurrence. This colitis does not seem to be associated with IBD.

TI  - Haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
PG  - 243-52
AB  - Diarrhoea-associated haemolytic uraemic syndrome develops in about 5 to 10% of
      children with haemorrhagic colitis due to Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 and 
      is a common cause of acute renal failure in childhood. Endothelial cell damage,
      white blood cell activation and platelet-endothelial cell interactions are
      important in the pathogenesis. Meticulous supportive care, with attention to
      nutrition and fluid, and electrolyte balance, is important. Dialysis is necessary
      in many children. Public health follow-up is important to minimise the spread of 
      E. coli O157:H7, which is transmitted by person-to-person, as well as through
      contaminated food products. 20-year follow-up studies report that 75% of children
      recover without any clinically significant long term sequelae. Chronic renal
      failure is reported in about 5% of children.

TI  - Butyrate inhibits inflammatory responses through NFkappaB inhibition:
      implications for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 397-403
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Proinflammatory cytokines are key factors in the pathogenesis of 
      Crohn's disease (CD). Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which is
      involved in their gene transcription, is increased in the intestinal mucosa of CD
      patients. As butyrate enemas may be beneficial in treating colonic inflammation, 
      we investigated if butyrate promotes this effect by acting on proinflammatory
      cytokine expression. METHODS: Intestinal biopsy specimens, isolated lamina
      propria cells (LPMC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured
      with or without butyrate for assessment of secretion of tumour necrosis factor
      (TNF) and mRNA levels. NFkappaB p65 activation was determined by
      immunofluorescence and gene reporter experiments. Levels of NFkappaB inhibitory
      protein (IkappaBalpha) were analysed by western blotting. The in vivo efficacy of
      butyrate was assessed in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced 
      colitis. RESULTS: Butyrate decreased TNF production and proinflammatory cytokine 
      mRNA expression by intestinal biopsies and LPMC from CD patients. Butyrate
      abolished lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced expression of cytokines by PBMC and
      transmigration of NFkappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. LPS induced
      NFkappaB transcriptional activity was decreased by butyrate while IkappaBalpha
      levels were stable. Butyrate treatment also improved TNBS induced colitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Butyrate decreases proinflammatory cytokine expression via
      inhibition of NFkappaB activation and IkappaBalpha degradation. These
      anti-inflammatory properties provide a rationale for assessing butyrate in the
      treatment of CD.

TI  - Inducible nitric oxide synthase activity in colon biopsies from inflammatory
      areas: correlation with inflammation intensity in patients with ulcerative
      colitis but not with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 229-37
AB  - Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities are responsible for the enzymatic
      conversion of L-arginine into NO and L-citrulline. Relatively low amounts of NO
      are produced in intestinal epithelial cells or are released from nerve endings.
      The effects of NO production are related to the maintenance of epithelial
      integrity and permeability. A pathological role of an increased NO production has
      been suggested to play a role in models of experimental colitis. In humans, NOS
      activity in colon mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis is clearly
      increased when compared with the activity of the control group. In contrast, an
      increase of NOS activity in the colon mucosa from patients with Crohn's disease
      remains controversial. In the present work, we have measured NOS activity in
      colon biopsies originating from the control group (n = 16), from patients with
      ulcerative colitis (n = 23) and Crohn's disease (n = 17) using the radiochemical 
      method of the conversion of L-[guanido-14C] arginine into radioactive
      L-citrulline. In the control group, NOS activity was mainly of the inducible type
      (88% of total NOS activity) since it was characterised by its insensibility to
      the absence of calcium in the assay medium. In colon biopsies originating from
      patients with ulcerative colitis, inducible NOS activity was increased 3 fold (p 
      < 0.005) and in patients with Crohn's disease, inducible NOS activity was
      increased 5 fold (p < 0.005). Correlations between NOS activity in colon biopsies
      and the intensity parameters of the disease i.e. Truelove index, endoscopic score
      and histological parameters were evidenced in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      In contrast, in patients with Crohn's disease, the high inducible NOS activity
      was not correlated with any intensity parameters of the disease. From these data,
      we concluded that although inducible NOS activity was increased several fold in
      colon biopsies originating from patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, a correlation between this activity and the severity of bowel
      inflammation was not found in either cases.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in recently diagnosed patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease compared with population controls.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with
      recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a
      comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD
      patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched
      population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status
      was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of
      nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight
      and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with
      controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD
      patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were
      significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum
      concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc)
      were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12
      concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not
      significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected
      negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional
      supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical
      course of the disease.

TI  - Normal thiopurine methyltransferase levels do not eliminate 6-mercaptopurine or
      azathioprine toxicity in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 409-13
AB  - 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine (AZA) are used to treat inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Side effects include infection, leukopenia, hepatitis, and
      pancreatitis. The level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes
      6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine, may reflect the risk of side effects. We sought
      to evaluate the relationship between the side effects of these medications and
      the TPMT level of pediatric patients with IBD. The medical records of our
      patients who were diagnosed with IBD and who received 6-MP or AZA were reviewed
      for measured TPMT levels. All red blood cell (RBC) TPMT levels were determined at
      the Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN. The occurrence of leukopenia,
      elevated aminotransferases, and pancreatitis was evaluated. Twenty-two patients, 
      mean age 13.7 years, received 6-MP or AZA and had TPMT levels measured. The TPMT 
      levels ranged 10.7-27.5 U/mL RBC with a mean of 17.2 +/- 3.2 U/mL RBC. Two
      children had levels below the accepted norm of 13.8 U/mL RBC. One of these
      patients (50%) developed both elevation of aminotransferases and leukopenia. Of
      all, 20 children had normal levels, 3 (15.0%) exhibited side effects: hepatitis
      (n = 2) and leukopenia (n = 1). We conclude that side effects of 6-MP or AZA
      occur despite normal TPMT levels.

TI  - Blood levels of natural antioxidants in gastric and colorectal precancerous
      lesions and cancers in Slovakia.
PG  - 37-40
AB  - A long-term sufficient intake of fruits and vegetables reduces significantly the 
      risk of gastric and colorectal carcinoma. It is anticipated that natural
      antioxidants are involved in this effect in addition to other substances. The aim
      of this study was to determine levels of vitamins A, C and E, as well as
      beta-carotene, selenium, zinc and copper in blood of 249 patients with
      precancerous lesions (atrophic gastritis, gastric hyperplastic polyp, gastric,
      colonic and rectal adenoma, chronic ulcerative colitis) and in 96 individuals
      with gastric, colonic or rectal carcinoma and to compare these levels with the
      values of a control group of 130 healthy individuals. We have found that the
      frequency of average values of analyzed micronutrients in precancerous groups was
      decreasing in the order vit C > vit E/vit A > Se > beta-car. The average levels
      of vitamins and beta-carotene were significantly reduced in all carcinoma groups,
      while selenium level showed a decrease only in the gastric carcinoma group.
      Copper level was elevated in the ulcerative colitis group and in all groups with 
      carcinoma. The results indicate a frequent insufficient saturation of organism by
      natural antioxidants in groups with precancerous lesions and carcinomas of
      stomach and colorectum. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the general
      consumption of fruits and vegetables in Slovakia as a part of primary prevention 
      of malignant diseases in these organs. Chemoprevention may be recommended in
      individuals with precancerous lesions.

TI  - Imbalance of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 in the mucosal lesions of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Degradation of the extracellular matrix and ulceration of the mucosa 
      are major features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One of the most important
      enzymes in degrading the matrix and produced in excess by cytokine activated
      stromal cells, is stromelysin-1. The activity of stromelysin-1 is controlled by
      tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), its natural inhibitor. In model
      systems excess stromelysin-1 produces mucosal degradation. METHODS: Quantitative 
      competitive RT-PCR was used to analyse stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 transcripts;
      western blotting was used to measure the amount of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1
      protein in biopsy samples from children with IBD. RESULTS: In biopsies from
      patients with active Crohn's disease (n=24), ulcerative colitis (n=23), and
      controls (n=16), TIMP-1 transcripts and protein were abundant and unchanged.
      Stromelysin-1 transcripts and protein were markedly elevated in mucosal biopsies 
      obtained from inflamed sites of patients with active IBD but were not elevated in
      adjacent endoscopically normal mucosa (n=10). Elevated levels of stromelysin-1
      transcripts in active Crohn's disease (n=5) returned to normal levels following
      treatment with enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Stromelysin-1 is markedly
      overexpressed at inflamed sites in patients with IBD whereas TIMP-1 remains
      unaltered. Excess stromelysin-1 is likely to be responsible for loss of mucosal
      integrity in IBD.

TI  - Decreased trabecular bone mineral density in newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel
      disease patients in Korea.
PG  - 512-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Western patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, BMD has never been studied in
      Asia where the demographic and socio-economic status are different from the West.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and mechanisms of
      osteopenia in newly diagnosed Korean patients with IBD. METHODS: We studied 14
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 25 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 
      all of whom had never been treated with corticosteroids. Bone mineral density was
      measured in the lumbar spine and the femoral neck by dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. Biochemical parameters including serum osteocalcin, parathyroid
      hormone, plasma inactive and active vitamin D, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were
      measured. RESULTS: The BMD Z score at the lumbar spine was lower both in CD and
      in UC patients, but there was no significant difference between the two groups.
      There was no significant difference in nutritional status or biochemical
      parameters of bone metabolism between patients with a normal BMD and those with a
      decreased BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD at the lumbar spine is common in newly
      diagnosed Korean patients with IBD, a result which is similar to Western studies.
      The mechanism for low bone mass remains undetermined; however, nutritional status
      and hormonal parameters of bone metabolism, and ethnic differences are not likely
      to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of this bone loss.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a scientific rationale?
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host
      immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease
      pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food
      ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on
      health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence
      from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and
      intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause 
      and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous
      research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of
      probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be
      fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic
      heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed
      that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although
      preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in
      treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified.
      However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification
      of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future,
      probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis
      on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional
      role.

TI  - New frontiers in the biology of GLP-2.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a 33 amino acid peptide hormone released from 
      the intestinal endocrine cells following nutrient ingestion. GLP-2 exerts trophic
      effects on the small and large bowel epithelium via stimulation of cell
      proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. GLP-2 also upregulates intestinal
      glucose transporter activity, and reduces gastric emptying and gastric acid
      secretion. The activity of GLP-2 is regulated in part via renal clearance and
      cleavage by the aminopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV. In experimental models of
      intestinal disease, GLP-2 reversed parenteral nutrition-induced mucosal atrophy
      and accelerated the process of endogenous intestinal adaptation in rats following
      major small bowel resection. GLP-2 also markedly attenuated intestinal injury and
      weight loss in mice with chemically-induced colitis, and significantly reduced
      mortality, bacterial infection and intestinal mucosal damage in mice with
      indomethacin-induced enteritis. The actions of GLP-2 are transduced by a recently
      cloned glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP-2R) that represents a new member of 
      the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The GLP-2R is expressed in a highly
      tissue-specific manner predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract and GLP-2R
      activation is coupled to increased adenylate cyclase activity. The available
      evidence suggests that the biological properties of GLP-2 merit careful
      therapeutic assessment in selected human diseases characterized by injury and
      defective repair of the gastrointestinal epithelium.

TI  - Toxic megacolon secondary to infective colitis in children.
PG  - 199-205
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Toxic megacolon is a fulminating and potentially lethal
      complication of severe colitis. Toxic megacolon secondary to infective colitis in
      children is rare. We analyzed the clinical course, pathology, treatment, and
      outcome of toxic megacolon secondary to infective colitis in children. METHODS:
      The medical records of all 20 children treated for infective colitis complicated 
      with toxic megacolon during a 12-month (October 1997-October 1998) period were
      retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 10 boys and 10 girls, with a mean
      (+/- standard deviation, SD) age of 26.2 +/- 12.9 months (range, 6-57 mo). With
      an initial presentation of nonspecific gastroenteritis syndrome lasting several
      days, the disease progressed rapidly. In the acute stage, most patients developed
      toxic signs such as mental change, ranging from irritability to stupor (20,
      100%), fever (19, 95%), tachycardia (20, 100%), abdominal distension (20, 100%), 
      and abnormal stool pattern (19, 95%). Initial investigations revealed anemia (11,
      55%), leukocytosis (11, 55%), and elevated levels of C-reactive protein ranging
      from 25.0 mg/L to 483.0 mg/L with a mean +/- SD of 185.7 +/- 129.1 mg/L (normal
      range, < 8 mg/L) (20, 100%). Salmonella enteritidis (12 patients, 60%) and
      Clostridium difficile (1, 5%) were isolated from stool samples in some cases.
      Plain abdominal x-rays revealed severe colonic dilatation. Prolonged
      hospitalization (mean, 33.6 d) and intensive therapy including a combination of
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, physical decompression, and total parenteral
      nutrition were necessary. Three patients (15%) underwent surgical management; the
      pathologic findings in these patients demonstrated severe transmural
      inflammation. We believe that bacterial and/or endotoxin translocation played an 
      important role in gut failure. Three patients (15%) in the study died.
      CONCLUSION: Toxic megacolon in infective colitis is a fulminating illness that
      has a high mortality rate. The disease course can be divided into three stages:
      the acute toxic stage, the gut failure stage, and the convalescence or
      deterioration stage. Early diagnosis and aggressive management are important.

TI  - Multiple organ dysfunction in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1258-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mortality rate in severe ulcerative colitis (UC) is commonly
      attributed to major colonic complications or surgical procedures. Early
      recognition of the severity of the colitis, intensive medical treatment, and
      prompt surgery have all contributed to improving its outcome over the past 40 yr.
      Recently, we have observed some fatal cases of severe UC in which death was
      related to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This complication,
      associated with a very high mortality rate, may occur in several acute critical
      diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, but has so far not been reported in 
      UC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and outcome of MODS in
      severe UC. METHODS: The records of 180 consecutive patients admitted to the
      Gastrointestinal Unit, University of Rome for an acute severe attack of UC during
      the period 1976-1998 were retrospectively analyzed. Severity of UC was defined
      according to the criteria of Truelove and Witts. MODS was defined according to
      the original criteria of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of
      Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference 1992. All patients were on a standard
      intensive regimen consisting of total parenteral nutrition and hydrocortisone 100
      mg q.i.d. Colectomy was performed according to the timing of the Oxford intensive
      regimen. RESULTS: Of these 180 severe UC patients, 11 (6.1%) experienced clinical
      and laboratory features of MODS. The lung was involved in five patients, the
      kidney in three, the liver in seven, the central nervous system in three, the
      hematological system in three, and the pancreas in one. MODS was preceded by
      toxic megacolon in five patients and by so-called "impending megacolon" in four, 
      whereas in two patients no previous complications of UC were observed. MODS
      developed during the first attack of colitis in seven patients and during relapse
      in four. The overall mortality rate was 12/180 (6.6%). Of the 12 patients who
      died, eight (72.7%) had MODS. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that UC must be
      included among the causes of MODS. In our referral center for inflammatory bowel 
      diseases, MODS was responsible for the majority of UC cases with a fatal outcome.
      The timely identification of signs of MODS should prompt admission to an
      intensive care unit and emergency surgery.

TI  - Deficiency of epithelial basement membrane laminin in ulcerative colitis affected
      human colonic mucosa.
PG  - 39-48
AB  - Imbalances in epithelium-matrix interactions have been discussed as a
      pathomechanism in ulcerative colitis, causing a colonic mucosal barrier
      dysfunction. Laminin, the major noncollagenous component of the basement
      membrane, plays a role in epithelial basal lamina formation and promotes
      differentiation of human enterocytes. We therefore investigated the distribution 
      of laminin in ulcerative colitis affected colonic tissues. Tissue specimens from 
      both affected and nonaffected colonic regions were obtained from ten patients
      with ulcerative colitis during colonoscopies or operations. Healthy tissue from
      five patients with colorectal cancer was used as control. After histological
      classification, the localization and distribution of the basement membrane
      associated extracellular matrix proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry.
      Paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with antibodies against laminin and
      type IV and V collagen. No positive immunoreactivity against laminin was found in
      most of the epithelial basement membranes surrounding the crypts in affected
      colonic tissues, without involvement of the subendothelial structures. In
      contrast, a type IV and V collagen accumulation occurred in all these tissue
      samples. The lack of laminin in combination with an overexpression of type IV and
      V collagen, as reported for the first time in this paper, leads to changes in
      basement membrane structure. These findings indicate that the three-dimensional
      network of the colonic epithelial basement membrane and its function are
      seriously disturbed in exacerbating ulcerative colitis. This provides new
      insights into the importance of cell-matrix interactions for physiological and
      pathological mechanisms in the etiology of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Diet as a risk factor for the development of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1008-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been considered as a possible risk factor for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). However, available data are inconsistent. The aim of the
      present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the
      development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43)
      and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a
      case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess
      dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition
      was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic
      regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used 
      for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake.
      RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]),
      polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 
      1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other
      significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of
      mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing
      UC. Whether this observation is a true risk factor in the development of UC or
      rather a reflection of a certain dietary lifestyle needs to be investigated.

TI  - Does cyclosporin A worsen liver function in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease and total parenteral nutrition?
PG  - 68-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and
      immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA) are well known factors in
      hepatobiliary disorders. Their association, however, has been little studied.
      METHOD: we retrospectively analyzed the results of liver function tests
      (transaminases, AST. ALT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in a consecutive series of 50 patients (29 men,
      21 women, mean age 32 years, range 16-78 years) hospitalized for a severe attack 
      of IBD between January 1992 and July 1997. Basal laboratory values in all
      patients were normal. Thirty-eight patients had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12
      had Crohn's disease (CD), which debuted in 28% of the patients. All patients were
      treated with methylprednisolone (MP) (0.75-1.0 mg/kg daily i.v., and received
      TPN. 42% (21/50) required additional treatment with CsA (5 mg/kg daily i.v.) at
      the beginning or during the first week of TPN and during 7-24 days, because on
      nonresponse to steroid treatment. Two study groups were defined according to
      treatment: Group I consisted of 29 patients given MP + TPN, and group II
      comprised 21 patients who received MP + TPN + CsA. The groups were otherwise
      similar in all other variables analyzed. Liver function tests were done weekly
      until the end of the study period. RESULTS: 62% of the patients (31/50) showed
      hepatobiliary dysfunction, defined previously as a 2-fold or greater elevation of
      two or more parameters. There was no statistically significant difference between
      the two groups in the incidence of dysfunction (15/29 vs 16/21, n.s.). The
      parameters that showed the greatest alterations were GGT and ALT; the greatest
      elevation appeared during the third week of immunosuppressive treatment, and did 
      not exceed 6-fold the normal value. The alterations disappeared once TPN and
      immunosuppressive treatment were discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: the hepatobiliary
      dysfunction in patients treated with both TPN and CsA was no more severe than
      associated with TPN alone.

TI  - Will recommended changes in fat and fibre intake affect cholesterol absorption
      and sterol excretion? An ileostomy study.
PG  - 306-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study cholesterol absorption and excretion in ileostomy subjects
      with different intakes of saturated fat and dietary fibre. DESIGN: Short-term
      experimental study, with four controlled diets in repeated measurements. SETTING:
      Out-patients at metabolic-ward kitchen. SUBJECTS: Nine healthy volunteers with
      conventional ileostomy after colectomy because of ulcerative colitis.
      INTERVENTIONS: Four diet periods, each of 3 days duration: high saturated fat and
      low dietary fibre (STAND); reduced saturated fat (RESAT); high saturated fat and 
      high fibre (FATFIB); and reduced saturated fat and high fibre (RESATFIB). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Absorption of cholesterol, and ileal excretion of cholesterol, 
      bile acids, fat and energy. Differences between diets evaluated with Friedman's
      two-way analysis of variance by rank sum with Bonferroni adjustment, and post hoc
      differences assessed by rank sum comparison. RESULTS: RESAT and RESATFIB reduced 
      fractional cholesterol absorption by 7% and 10%; RESATFIB and FATFIB increased
      net cholesterol excretion by 46% and 54% respectively. Further, RESATFIB
      increased net sterol excretion by 18%, all compared to STAND (P<0.05 for all).
      All three intervention diets contained more phytosterols than STAND (P<0.05), and
      the phytosterol content was inversely correlated to fractional cholesterol
      absorption (r=-0.77, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current nutrition recommendations to
      reduce saturated fat and increase dietary fibre affect sterol excretion
      additively. The effect on cholesterol absorption might be partly explained by the
      content of dietary plant sterols. SPONSORSHIP: Supported by grants from the
      Gothenburg Medical Society, grant numbers 94/086 and 99/082, and by the

TI  - Predictive factors of outcome of intensive intravenous treatment for attacks of
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 273-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive intravenous treatment remains the first line therapy of
      severe, uncomplicated attacks of ulcerative colitis. AIM: To predict the failure 
      of intensive intravenous treatment by combining clinical and laboratory
      parameters with endoscopy findings. METHODS: Retrospective study conducted in a
      tertiary care referral centre. Failure of intensive intravenous treatment was
      defined as colectomy before day 30, intravenous cyclosporin, or death. Predictive
      factors of outcome were assessed using univariate and multivariate prognostic
      analysis. RESULTS: Between January 1990 and May 1997, 85 consecutive patients
      were treated with intensive intravenous treatment for non-response to oral
      corticosteroids (n=59) and/or severe attack of ulcerative colitis (n=26). There
      were 41 successes and 44 failures (including 1 death, 13 cyclosporin and 30
      colectomies before day 30). Multivariate prognostic analysis found that the
      presence of Truelove and Witts' criteria (P=0.018), an attack that had lasted
      more than 6 weeks (P=0.001), and severe endoscopic lesions (P=0.007) were
      associated with an increased risk of failure. Patients with severe endoscopic
      lesions and Truelove and Witts' criteria, or an attack of more than 6 weeks had a
      failure rate of 85-86%. CONCLUSION: Clinical, laboratory and endoscopic findings 
      can predict the risk of failure of intensive intravenous treatment. A prospective
      study is required to confirm these results.

TI  - Soy sterol esters and beta-sitostanol ester as inhibitors of cholesterol
      absorption in human small bowel.
PG  - 908-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant sterols are natural dietary components with serum
      cholesterol-lowering properties. The lowering of serum cholesterol by plant
      sterols is believed to be the result of an inhibition of cholesterol absorption
      in the small bowel, although increased bile acid excretion has also been
      suggested. The difference in effect of saturated and unsaturated plant sterols on
      cholesterol absorption needs to be elucidated further. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim
      of this study was to measure small-bowel cholesterol absorption and sterol
      excretion in addition to hepatic cholesterol synthesis after intake of soy sterol
      esters and beta-sitostanol ester corresponding to 1.5 g plant sterols/d. DESIGN: 
      Seven ileostomy subjects were studied during a control period and 2 intervention 
      periods when either soy sterol esters or beta-sitostanol ester was added to a
      basal diet. Ileostomy bags were collected every other hour and frozen immediately
      for analysis of nutrients and sterols. RESULTS: Cholesterol absorption was 56%
      (43-65%) in the control period and decreased to 38% (32-46%) in the soy sterol
      ester period (P = 0.00) and to 39% (30-48%) in the beta-sitostanol ester period
      (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: Esterified soy sterols and beta-sitostanol inhibited
      cholesterol absorption equally, despite the different structures of the plant
      sterols.

TI  - Direct hospital costs for patients with inflammatory bowel disease in a Canadian 
      tertiary care university hospital.
PG  - 677-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We set out to determine the direct costs of hospitalizations of
      patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis admitted to a
      university-affiliated tertiary care hospital and to contrast the costs of medical
      versus surgical inpatient care, Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis, and to
      identify dominant components of inpatient costs. METHODS: We used a
      patient-specific case costing system at Saint Boniface General Hospital,
      Winnipeg, Manitoba, for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. We extracted all inpatients
      whose hospital discharge abstracts included ICD-9-CM codes 555 (Crohn's disease) 
      and 556 (ulcerative colitis) among the top eight discharge diagnoses, and
      performed a chart review on all cases to ensure that the hospitalization was for 
      inflammatory bowel disease and the diagnoses were accurate. We analyzed cases
      based on their disease diagnosis, primary mode of therapy associated with the
      hospitalization (medical vs surgical), and their major diagnosis-related group
      (DRG). This study evaluated direct patient care costs only and costs are
      expressed in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of 362 hospital admissions, 325 were
      eligible and of these admissions 275 belonged to the digestive system DRGs.
      Seventy-one (37%) were admitted more than once during the 2 yr of the study,
      accounting for 202 (62%) of the total number of admissions. The mean cost per
      admission of all cases of Crohn's disease was $3,149 (95% confidence interval
      [CI], $2,665-$3,634) and for ulcerative colitis was $3,726 (95% CI
      $3,008-$4,445). Surgical therapy cases accounted for 49.8% of all admissions,
      57.8% of all hospital days, and 60.5% of all costs. Patients treated surgically
      had more costly hospitalizations than those treated medically, particularly when 
      analyzing only nontotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) cases. Surgical treatment
      admissions were significantly more costly for ulcerative colitis digestive DRG
      admissions than Crohn's disease. The nondigestive DRG admissions were more costly
      than the digestive DRGs in all categories although this was only statistically
      different among medically treated Crohn's disease. Patients treated medically
      were similarly costly whether they had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
      There was no significant difference in cost per admission among cases admitted
      multiple times, compared with those admitted only once. TPN cases accounted for
      9.5% of cases but 27.1% of costs. TPN-associated hospitalizations were more
      costly than non-TPN-use hospitalizations but these costs were primarily driven by
      duration of stay rather than TPN use itself. For all cases, the top five cost
      categories in descending order were nursing unit bed-days, drugs and pharmacy,
      diagnostic lab tests, operating room, and diagnostic imaging and endoscopy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using our system we could determine direct costs for inpatients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and the factors that determined increased costs.
      Medical therapy admissions were similarly costly between Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis; however, surgical therapy admissions were costlier among
      ulcerative colitis patients. Admissions for nondigestive DRGs were more costly
      than those for digestive DRGs. TPN use identified a sicker group of patients who 
      remained in the hospital longer than nonusers and, not surprisingly, these were
      the costliest patients.

TI  - A new method for the determination of sulphide in gastrointestinal contents and
      whole blood by microdistillation and ion chromatography.
PG  - 115-25
AB  - Hydrogen sulphide is produced in the human large intestine by the bacterial
      reduction of dietary inorganic sulphate and sulphite and by fermentation of
      sulphur amino acids. Sulphide may damage the colonic epithelium and has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The accurate measurement of
      sulphide in biological samples, particularly in gut contents is difficult due to 
      the volatile nature of the compound, and the viscosity and turbidity of the
      samples. Here we describe a method for the determination of sulphide in gut
      contents and whole blood which overcomes these problems. Initially, samples are
      treated with zinc acetate to trap sulphide. A microdistillation pretreatment is
      then used, which releases sulphide from its stable, stored state, coupled to ion 
      chromatography with electrochemical detection. The limit of detection of the
      method was determined as 2.5 micromol/l, which enabled sulphide levels in gut
      contents and whole blood samples obtained from humans to be accurately
      determined. A preliminary investigation in healthy human subjects showed blood
      sulphide ranged from 10 to 100 micromol/l. Whole blood sulphide did not change
      significantly when increasing amounts of protein from meat were fed. However,
      faecal sulphide did show a significant increase from 164 to 754 nmol/g in four
      subjects fed diets which contained 60 and 420 g meat.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish the type and severity of pediatric
      inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is
      important, because treatment options and clinical course may vary. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) allows noninvasive transmural assessment of the intestine
      and may facilitate differentiation of ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease.
      The objective of this prospective study was to determine whether MRI
      differentiates Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis in children as effectively
      as colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent
      colonoscopy with biopsies followed by abdominal MRI. The MRI diagnosis,
      determined by two radiologists independently completing a standardized form was
      compared with the gastroenterologic diagnosis. RESULTS: After colonoscopy and
      review of histology, Crohn's disease was diagnosed in nine patients, ulcerative
      colitis in five, and indeterminate colitis in one, who was excluded from study.
      Agreement of the MRI diagnosis with the gastroenterologic diagnosis was 4 of 4
      (100%) for ulcerative colitis, 4 of 10 (40%) for Crohn's disease considering both
      radiologists, and 5 of 10 (50%) for Crohn's disease for each radiologist
      individually. Percentage of enhancement by MRI did not correlate with the
      severity of inflammation determined at endoscopy among the patients with Crohn's 
      disease (r = -0.3, P = 0.366). There was agreement on severity of inflammation in
      three of four patients with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Current MRI
      interpretation of inflammatory bowel disease did not adequately recognize Crohn's
      disease in children. Therefore, colonoscopy with biopsy remains the most accurate
      tool for determining the type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children and adolescents.

PG  - 87-90
AB  - Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids exert antiinflammatory effects on patients with
      ulcerative colitis. However, a comparative study in patients with mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis receiving only sulfasalazine or omega-3 fatty acids
      has not been performed. We sought to detect changes in the inflammatory disease
      activity with the use of either fish oil omega-3 fatty acids or sulfasalazine in 
      patients with ulcerative colitis. Ten patients (five male, five female; mean age 
      = 48 +/- 12 y) with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis were investigated 
      in a randomized cross-over design. They received either sulfasalazine (2 g/d) or 
      omega-3 fatty acids (5.4 g/d) for 2 m.o. Disease activity was assessed by
      clinical and laboratory indicators, sigmoidoscopy, histology, and whole-body
      protein turnover (with 15N-glycine). Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids resulted 
      in greater disease activity as detected by a significant increase in platelet
      count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and total fecal
      nitrogen excretion. No major changes in protein synthesis and breakdown were
      observed during either treatment. In conclusion, treatment with sulfasalazine is 
      superior to treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with mild to moderate 
      active ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 90-100
AB  - The treatment of Crohn's disease depends on disease location and disease
      activity. It can be divided into medical and surgical treatment. While surgery is
      reserved for complications such as abscesses or failure of pharmacological
      treatment (fistulae, perianal disease, or strictures) medical treatment aims at
      induction and maintenance of remission. In order to achieve these goals
      supportive and therapeutic strategies must be used. Supportive measures include
      substitution of vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals in
      deficiencies due to resection or disease involvement of the small bowel. All
      patients on long-term steroids should receive calcium and vitamin D in order to
      prevent osteoporosis. Therapeutic options include drug treatment
      (corticosteroids, antibiotics, salicylates, and immunosuppressives), nutrition
      (parenteral or enteral), and endoscopy (dilatation of strictures). Depending on
      disease location different pharmacologic preparations of salicylates or
      corticosteroids should be used, e.g., enemas for distal colitis. The most potent 
      drugs for long-term control are immunosuppressive agents, particularly
      azathioprine. It is the most widely investigated immunosuppressive agent in
      Crohn's disease and should be the first line treatment for patients with steroid 
      refractory, chronic steroid dependent, fistulating, and stenosing courses. In the
      future, more potent drugs and better risk stratification criteria should improve 
      the treatment of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Dietary resistant starch and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 201-11
AB  - These studies were performed to test the benefit of resistant starch on
      ulcerative colitis via prebiotic and butyrate effects. Butyrate, propionate, and 
      acetate are produced in the colon of mammals as a result of microbial
      fermentation of resistant starch and other dietary fibers. Butyrate plays an
      important role in the colonic mucosal growth and epithelial proliferation. A
      reduction in the colonic butyrate level induces chronic mucosal atrophy.
      Short-chain fatty acid enemas increase mucosal generation, crypt length, and DNA 
      content of the colonocytes. They also ameliorate symptoms of ulcerative colitis
      in human patients and rats injected with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).
      Butyrate, and also to a lesser degree propionate, are substrates for the aerobic 
      energy metabolism, and trophic factors of the colonocytes. Adverse butyrate
      effects occur in normal and neoplastic colonic cells. In normal cells, butyrate
      induces proliferation at the crypt base, while inhibiting proliferation at the
      crypt surface. In neoplastic cells, butyrate inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests
      cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The improvement of the
      TNBS-induced colonic inflammation occurred earlier in the resistant starch
      (RS)-fed rats than in the RS-free group. This benefit coincided with activation
      of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and the subsequent restoration of
      apoptosis. The noncollagenous basement membrane protein laminin was regenerated
      initially in the RS-fed group, demonstrating what could be a considered lower
      damage to the intestinal barrier function. The calculation of intestinal
      short-chain fatty acid absorption confirmed this conclusion. The uptake of
      short-chain fatty acids in the colon is strongly inhibited in the RS-free group, 
      but only slightly reduced in the animals fed with RS. Additionally, RS enhanced
      the growth of intestinal bacteria assumed to promote health. Further studies
      involving patients suffering from ulcerative colitis are necessary to determine
      the importance of RS in the therapy of a number of intestinal diseases and the
      maintenance of health.

AB  - A 28-year-old woman developed an acute exacerbation of chronic ulcerative colitis
      in the second trimester of pregnancy. She was treated by intensive medical
      treatment with intravenous prednisolone, betamethasone enema, oral
      salazosulfapyridine, intravenous ceftazitim, and total parenteral nutrition. The 
      acute relapse subsided after 73 days of the treatment and a normal female newborn
      weighing 2,208 g was delivered vaginally after 40 weeks' gestation. Our
      experience showed that the intensive medical therapy did not impair either the
      course of the pregnancy or the fetal outcome.

      study, and future research.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Few clinical studies suggest a significant influence of diet or nutritional
      supplementation on ulcerative colitis. One reason is that ulcerative colitis,
      like many chronic diseases, is multifactorial. This article will describe and
      review the relevant literature on ulcerative colitis, including studies of (1)
      diet and intravenous therapy, (2) nutritional status and nutritional
      supplementation, and (3) bowel flora and immune function and their influences.
      Also, results of a retrospective chart review study that was done at a
      complementary medicine office will be presented. Finally, suggestions for future 
      research will be discussed based on a nutritional model of ulcerative colitis.
      Taken together, it is hoped that these areas will clarify the current status of
      ulcerative colitis research and promote the types of investigations that are
      necessary to establish the validity of nutritional influences on ulcerative
      colitis as well as the mechanisms that are involved.

TI  - Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis associated with chronic inflammatory
      bowel disease in children.
PG  - 2500-7
AB  - Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare disease of children
      characterized by aseptic inflammation of the long bones and clavicles. No
      infectious etiology has been identified, and CRMO has been associated with a
      number of autoimmune diseases (including Wegener's granulomatosis and psoriasis).
      The relationship between CRMO and inflammatory bowel disease is poorly described.
      Through an internet bulletin board subscribed to by 500 pediatric
      gastroenterologists, we identified six inflammatory bowel disease patients (two
      with ulcerative colitis, four with Crohn's colitis) with confirmed CRMO. In all
      cases, onset of the bony lesions preceded the onset of bowel symptoms by as much 
      as five years. Immunosuppressive therapy for the bowel disease generally resulted
      in improvement of the bone inflammation. Chronic recurrent multifocal
      osteomyelitis should be considered in any inflammatory bowel disease patient with
      unexplained bone pain or areas of uptake on bone scan. CRMO may be a rare
      extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease; alternatively,
      certain individuals may be genetically predisposed to the development of both
      diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Butyrate oxidation within the colonocyte is selectively inhibited by 
      hydrogen sulphide, reproducing the metabolic lesion observed in active ulcerative
      colitis. AIMS: To study generation of hydrogen sulphide by sulphate reducing
      bacteria (SRB) and the effects of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis in order to identify a role of this noxious agent in
      pathogenesis. PATIENTS: Fresh faeces were obtained from 37 patients with
      ulcerative colitis (23 with active disease) and 16 healthy controls. METHODS: SRB
      were enumerated from fresh faecal slurries and measurements made of sulphate
      reducing activity, and sulphate and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. The effect 
      of 5-ASA on hydrogen sulphide production was studied in vitro. RESULTS: All
      controls and patients with active ulcerative colitis carried SRB and total viable
      counts were significantly related to the clinical severity grade. SRB were of two
      distinct types: rapidly growing strains (desulfovibrios) which showed high
      sulphate reduction rates, present in 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis and 
      44% of controls; and slow growing strains which had little activity. In vitro,
      5-ASA inhibited sulphide production in a dose dependent manner; in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis not on these drugs faecal sulphide was significantly higher
      than in controls (0.55 versus 0.25 mM, p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Counts and carriage
      rates of SRB in faeces of patients with ulcerative colitis are not significantly 
      different from those in controls. SRB metabolism is not uniform between strains
      and alternative sources of hydrogen sulphide production exist in the colonic
      lumen which may be similarly inhibited by 5-ASA. The evidence for hydrogen
      sulphide as a metabolic toxin in ulcerative colitis remains circumstantial.

TI  - Low levels of glutathione in endoscopic biopsies of patients with Crohn's
      colitis: the role of malnutrition.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During active Crohn's disease, generation of free radicals
      is increased, and nutritional depletion is frequent. We investigated the
      glutathione concentration of the colonic mucosa in biopsies from patients with
      active Crohn's colitis depending on nutritional status. METHODS: Endoscopic
      biopsies were taken in 10 well-nourished control patients, and 18 patients with
      active Crohn's disease (11 well-nourished, seven malnourished with a recent
      weight loss > 10 %). Colonic biopsies were taken from healthy and inflamed mucosa
      and analysed for total glutathione concentration. RESULTS: Mucosal glutathione
      concentration (nmol/mg wet tissue) was lower in patients with active colitis both
      in diseased and healthy mucosa as compared with controls (1.89 +/- 0.39, 2.08 +/-
      0.4 and 6.69 +/- 4. 94, respectively, P< 0.05). Mucosal glutathione was lower in 
      healthy mucosa from malnourished versus well-nourished patients: 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs
      2.3 +/- 0.37 (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal glutathione is markedly lower in
      active Crohn's colitis, even in healthy mucosa; glutathione depletion tends to be
      more severe in malnourished patients. Glutathione depletion may be related in
      part to malnutrition and contribute to a prolonged evolution of disease and could
      be a target for pharmacological and nutritional support.

PG  - 810-5
AB  - Autoimmune enteropathy is an increasingly recognized cause of severe protracted
      diarrhea, usually affecting infants and children predisposed to autoimmune
      phenomena. Although this may be a common cause of diarrheal illness, it is
      scarcely recognized in the American literature. In association with thymoma, a
      case of so-called graft-vs-host-like colitis and 2 cases of chronic diarrhea
      associated with thymoma were reported, but, to our knowledge, no cases of
      autoimmune enteropathy have been reported as such. We describe 2 adults with
      autoimmune enteropathy found in association with a thymoma.

TI  - [Treatment of mild and moderate ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 2516-20
AB  - Selection of treatment for ulcerative colitis is based on the definition of
      clinical severity. In those medication is a main course. Mild and moderate cases 
      are treated mainly with salicylazosulfapyridine or mesalazine. Patients with
      proctitis-type are added betamethazone suppositories and those with left-sided
      and total colitis-type predonisolone enema therapy simultaneously. If there is no
      response, they are given additional oral predonisolone. Even after remission,
      patients should be carefully observed. A good patient-physician relationship,
      continuation of maintenance therapy, and periodic follow-up examinations using
      colonoscopy or barium enema are essential to successful long-term management of
      this disease. Patients who have repeated relapsing should receive the stronger
      treatment, according to the endoscopic findings and clinical course in addition
      to the clinical severity.

PG  - 2472-5
AB  - Despite its supplementary role for a remedy of the Ulcerative Colitis,
      nutritional therapy performs the important role as well as medicine. In the
      active state, the aim of nutrition therapy is to reduce the activity of the
      disease. In the remission state, the aim is to keep the condition and to supply
      elements of nutrition which the disease causes these deficiency such as vitamins 
      or minerals. Needless to say, it is required to consider a few points; patient's 
      condition, lesion's digestion disorder and leakage, or side effects of caused by 
      medicines. High calorie, low fat and rich protein is ideal for the nutrition
      therapy for this disease, however it is suggested to satisfy patient's mental
      health at the same time. Nutrition therapy for Ulcerative Colitis should be
      regarded as the long-term treatment that requires the co-operation and
      comprehension between patients and medical supporting staffs.

PG  - 71S-80S
AB  - Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and
      trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
      and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In
      general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any
      restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and
      the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the
      nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use
      of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice
      nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at
      least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a
      specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been
      suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the
      activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in 
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in 
      maintaining the remission of the disease.

TI  - Oral microemulsion cyclosporin to reduce steroids rapidly in chronic active
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 905-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The list of the therapeutic tools for chronic active ulcerative
      colitis lacks a potent and reliably absorbed immune modifier to help wean
      patients from steroids. We investigated whether oral microemulsion cyclosporin
      (Neoral) can achieve this goal. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary
      care referral centre. PARTICIPANTS: Nine consecutive patients facing colectomy
      because of steroid-dependent chronic active ulcerative colitis were studied: the 
      disease was left-sided in six of them and had lasted a median of 10 years. Two
      patients depended on prednisone 12.5 mg/day, six on 25 mg, and one on 35 mg. The 
      median cumulative steroid dose in the month preceding the trial had been 750 mg. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Neoral was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, which was then
      titrated to reach a whole-blood therapeutic range of 60-240 ng/ml. During the
      three-month trial, previous drugs were continued but steroids were tapered
      according to the patient's clinical condition. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The
      number of patients leaving the trial with quiescent disease and a significantly
      decreased need for steroids. RESULTS: Eight of the nine patients (89%) showed an 
      initial response and commenced tapering steroids. Remission to the end of the 3rd
      month was observed in five cases treated with < or = 15 mg steroids daily (median
      cumulative dose 150 mg). Of the remaining four cases, two were partial responders
      and two failures, with the failure being linked to poor drug absorption in at
      least one patient. CONCLUSION: Neoral may help wean patients with chronic active 
      ulcerative colitis from steroids, but this novel indication of cyclosporin must
      be tested in a specifically designed study.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in the management of patients with acute
      attacks of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the prolonged duration of
      total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      parameters and short-term outcome in acute attacks of ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's colitis, and the difference in the response to TPN between the two
      diseases. Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative
      colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were
      analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were
      treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were 
      treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both
      groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical
      characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks
      were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the
      clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between
      the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations
      were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). 
      The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter,
      inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with
      ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy
      rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast,
      TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both
      the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12
      patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional
      benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In
      contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 23-31; quiz 32-4
AB  - The chronic, unpredictability of inflammatory bowel disease makes it difficult
      for patients to cope. In fact several studies quoted by Cox (1995) found that the
      Majority of IBD patients, even the one's who considered themselves "well,"
      experienced some impairment in quality of life. Early detection of IBD is
      essential in developing patient confidence and providing motivation for
      cooperation in treatment. Irvine (1997) conducted a study dealing with the
      quality of life issues with IBD and concluded that despite impairments, most
      patients with IBD overcame the obstacles imposed by their illness and managed to 
      remain productive members of society. Similar management (with anti-inflammatory 
      drugs) makes differentiating between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      during the early stages of the disease, unnecessary. Situations that require
      differentiation include: right sided pain or tenderness, steatorrhea, nutritional
      deficiencies, or a palpable mass (Macrae & Bhathal, 1997). Although IBD continues
      to be of unknown etiology, recent advances and further study in the areas of the 
      immune system, genetics and environmental influences may provide helpful
      treatment options in the future. For now, the clinician/patient goal must be to
      maintain adequate nutrition, promote healing, treat complications, and maintain
      an optimal lifestyle.

TI  - Biologic properties and therapeutic potential of glucagon-like peptide-2.
PG  - S98-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a 33 amino acid, proglucagon-derived
      peptide with intestinotrophic activity, is secreted from enteroendocrine cells in
      the small and large intestine. METHODS: This review describes recent advances in 
      our understanding of GLP-2 physiology from rodent experiments in vivo. RESULTS:
      GLP-2 administration induces mucosal epithelial proliferation in small and large 
      bowel and stomach. GLP-2 is rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase
      IV (DPP-IV) to produce the biologically inactive form GLP-2(3-33), however, GLP-2
      analogs that confer resistance to DPP-IV exhibit enhanced biologic activity in
      vivo. GLP-2-treated bowel retains normal to enhanced functional absorptive
      capacity. Furthermore, GLP-2 infusion prevents total parenteral nutrition
      (TPN)-associated intestinal hypoplasia, and enhances bowel adaptation and
      nutrient absorption in rats following small bowel resection. GLP-2 also reverses 
      weight loss and improves histologic and biochemical parameters of disease
      activity in mice with experimental colitis. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-2 is an
      intestine-derived peptide with intestinotrophic properties that may be
      therapeutically useful in diseases characterized by intestinal damage or
      insufficiency.

TI  - Essential fatty acids in health and chronic disease.
PG  - 560S-569S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s [doi]
AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3
      and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous
      increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of
      vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and
      soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges
      from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies
      indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to
      one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood
      viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3
      Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic,
      hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty
      acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils
      [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However,
      alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and
      walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself
      may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.

TI  - Bone mineral metabolism in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 192-9
AB  - The development of reliable techniques to measure bone densitometry and evolving 
      effective drug treatment have kindled great interest in the diagnosis and
      treatment of osteoporosis in adults with inflammatory bowel disease. A number of 
      studies have examined the prevalence of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in
      children and adolescents. Studies, conducted over the past decade, indicate a
      greater likelihood of clinically significant problems in Crohn's disease than in 
      ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids have been proven to impair bone mineral
      status. It is increasingly clear that inflammation and other factors play a
      bigger role than malabsorbtion of minerals or vitamin D in most patients. As the 
      use of the bisphonate class of drugs is limited in pediatric patients, there is a
      need to emphasize the role of diet and exercise in children and teenagers,
      particularly in those affected by inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Acute ischaemic colitis following intravenous cocaine use.
PG  - 305-7
AB  - Intestinal ischaemia is an uncommon complication of recreational cocaine abuse.
      We report the case of a 36-year-old male who underwent emergency surgery for
      acute abdomen. At laparotomy, the transverse colon appeared markedly oedematous, 
      dilated and with subserosal haemorrhage. Segmental resection was performed and
      microscopic examination of the resected specimen showed focal necrosis of the
      mucosa with a patchy polymorphonuclear and mononuclear infiltrate. The submucosa 
      was markedly thickened due to oedema; focal haemorrhage was observed and blood
      vessels were dilated but showed no structural abnormalities or thrombosis. These 
      findings were consistent with ischaemic colitis. No risk factors for intestinal
      ischaemia were present but the patient stated that he had injected cocaine i.v.
      the day before the onset of symptoms. He was not a cocaine abuser but
      occasionally sniffed, smoked or injected cocaine. Cocaine use should be
      considered in the aetiological diagnosis of intestinal ischaemia in young
      patients.

TI  - Pregnancy outcome in patients requiring parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 164-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate maternal and
      perinatal outcomes and complications of parenteral nutrition during pregnancy in 
      our institution. METHODS: This study was a review of medical records of all women
      who required parenteral nutrition during pregnancy at our institution from
      1990-1997. The frequency of maternal and perinatal complications was calculated. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-six pregnancies required parenteral nutrition for the following
      indications: hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 16), cholecystitis/pancreatitis (n = 3),
      small bowel obstruction (n = 2), intracranial bleed (n = 2), ulcerative colitis
      (n = 1), and other (n = 2). The mean gestational age at initiation of therapy was
      16.2 weeks and the mean duration of therapy was 30.6 days. Five pregnancies were 
      terminated prior to fetal viability. Of the remaining pregnancies, obstetric
      complications occurred in 11, including two cases of idiopathic preterm labor
      resulting in preterm deliveries. Maternal complications resulting from the
      central venous catheters included four infections, two thromboses, one occlusion,
      one pneumothorax, and one catheter dislodgment. The complication rate for
      centrally inserted central catheters (50%) was significantly greater than the
      rate for peripherally inserted central catheters (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Successful
      outcomes can be achieved in obstetric patients requiring parenteral nutrition. In
      this group of patients, the frequency of maternal complications secondary to
      centrally inserted central venous catheters was greater than that reported in
      nonpregnant patients. Peripherally inserted central catheters may be preferable
      when parenteral nutrition is required during pregnancy.

TI  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis in children.
PG  - 588-93
AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic inflammatory process affecting
      the extrahepatic and/or medium to large bile ducts, is not rare in children. It
      has features suggesting an autoimmune pathogenesis, although the mechanism of
      tissue damage remains unknown. The clinical presentation of childhood primary
      sclerosing cholangitis is highly variable and frequently without obvious features
      of cholestasis. Clinical similarity to autoimmune hepatitis is common.
      Association with chronic colitis is less common than in adults. Cholangiography
      is essential for the diagnosis and examination of the medium to large
      intrahepatic ducts is mandatory, as 40% of children lack extrahepatic duct
      involvement. Histological findings may help to distinguish childhood PSC from
      autoimmune hepatitis. In children, sclerosing cholangitis may also develop
      secondary to other disease processes, notably Langerhans histiocytosis,
      congenital immunodeficiencies and cystic fibrosis. Neonatal sclerosing
      cholangitis is chronic inflammatory disease of bile ducts which presents
      initially with neonatal cholestasis; its pathogenesis remains uncertain and may
      not be the same as for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Effective treatment
      modalities for childhood PSC remain undetermined. Liver transplantation is
      required for children who progress to biliary cirrhosis and hepatic
      decompensation.

AB  - IBD is a chronic pediatric disease that needs to be treated by a team of experts 
      consisting of pediatricians, pediatric gastroenterologists, psychologists,
      nutritionists, social workers, and nurses. A critical factor in successful
      management of this disease is the willingness of the patient to participate and
      cooperate with the team. Parents and patients must be educated and supported to
      treat these disorders effectively. Much further research is necessary to
      understand the specific causative and therapeutic issues unique to young patients
      with IBD.

AB  - This article reviews the nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      including the mechanisms and manifestations of malnutrition and the efficacy of
      nutritional therapies. Nutrient deficiencies in patients with IBD occur via
      several mechanisms and may complicate the course of the disease. Nutritional
      status is assessed by clinical examination and the use of nutritional indices
      such as the Subjective Global Assessment of nutritional status. Nutritional
      intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the 
      costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted,
      especially in patients presumed to need parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Structured versus long-chain triglycerides: a safety, tolerance, and efficacy
      randomized study in colorectal surgical patients.
PG  - 123-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: After trauma or surgery, researchers have suggested that medium-chain
      triglycerides have metabolic advantages, although they are toxic in large doses. 
      To try to reduce this potential toxicity, structured lipids, which provide a
      higher oxidation rate, faster clearance from blood, improved nitrogen balance,
      and less accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, could be used.
      Therefore, we evaluated, through a blind randomized study, the safety, tolerance,
      and efficacy of structured triglycerides, compared with long-chain triglycerides 
      (LCT), in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. METHODS: Nineteen patients were
      randomized to receive long-chain or structured triglycerides as a lipid source.
      They received the same amount of calories (27.2/kg/d), glucose (4 g/kg/d),
      protein (0.2 g/kg/d), and lipids (11.2 kcal/kg/d). Patients were evaluated during
      and after the treatment for clinical and laboratory variables, daily and
      cumulative nitrogen balance, urinary excretion of 3-methyl-histidine, and urinary
      3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio. RESULTS: No adverse effect that required the 
      interruption of the treatment was observed. Triglyceride levels and clinical and 
      laboratory variables were similar in the two groups. A predominantly positive
      nitrogen balance was observed from day 2 until day 5 in the LCT group and from
      day 1 until day 4 in the structured triglycerides group. The cumulative nitrogen 
      balance (in grams) for days 1 to 3 was 9.7+/-5.2 in the experimental group and
      4.4+/-11.8 in the control group (p = .2). For days 1 to 5 it was 10.7+/-10.5 and 
      6.5+/-17.9 (p = .05), respectively. The excretion of 3-methylhistidine was higher
      in the control group but decreased in the following days and was similar to the
      experimental group on day 5. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first report 
      in which structured triglycerides are administered in postoperative patients to
      evaluate safety, tolerance, and efficacy. It suggests that Fe73403 is safe, well 
      tolerated, and efficacious in terms of nitrogen balance when compared with LCT
      emulsion.

TI  - Local and systemic liberation of proinflammatory cytokines in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 830-5
AB  - Determination of plasma and tissue cytokine levels in inflammatory bowel disease 
      have frequently resulted in conflicting data. In the present study we determined 
      in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the levels of the proinflammatory
      cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and
      tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha liberated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) after 48-hr culture with
      pokeweed mitogen (PWM). IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the
      supernatant were detected by ELISA. Results show low basal levels of IL-1beta
      secretion by PBMC and LPMC, and a considerable increase after mitogen
      stimulation. Basal IL-6 production by PBMC was higher in UC patients than in
      controls [2029 pg/ml, CI95(-165 to 4223) vs 572 pg/ml (-383 to 1527)
      respectively, P = 0.05] and also after PWM activation [14,995 pg/ml (7759-22,230)
      vs 6598 pg/ml (3240-9956), respectively, P = 0.05]. In LPMC, no differences in
      IL-6 secretion were observed. TNF-alpha in activated PBMC of patients with UC was
      not significantly increased in relation to control (P = 0.09). No constitutive
      secretion of IFN-gamma was observed in mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma levels
      secreted by activated LPMC were lower in patients with UC than in controls [1571 
      pg/ml (-108 to 3251) vs 7953 pg/ml (3851-12,055), respectively, P = 0.03]. These 
      results suggest that IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha participate as mediators in
      the inflammatory phenomena observed in UC. Further studies are necessary to
      evaluate the role of IFN-gamma in this condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of dysplasia 
      and the mucosal adaptation patterns of pelvic pouches in children and adolescents
      who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS:
      Between 1982 and 1996, 176 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis underwent
      ilial pouch-anal anastomosis. Seventy-six patients were followed up after surgery
      at the Cleveland Clinic. Pouch biopsy specimens were reviewed for dysplasia and
      to determine mucosal adaptation patterns. Fifty-eight of the 76 patients had an
      average of three mucosal biopsies during a mean follow-up of 5 years. Demographic
      and surgical data were abstracted from archives of medical records. All
      previously obtained pouch biopsy specimens were re-evaluated by a single
      pathologist to ensure standardized interpretation. RESULTS: No dysplasia was
      identified in screening specimens of 76 children and adolescents including 5
      patients who showed dysplasia in resected colon specimens. The pattern of mucosal
      adaptation was categorized using previously reported criteria. Type A was defined
      as normal mucosa or mild villous atrophy with no or mild inflammation. Type B
      mucosa showed transient atrophy with temporary moderate inflammation followed by 
      normalization of architecture. Type C mucosa was defined as a pattern of
      persistent atrophy with severe inflammation. In the study cohort, the patterns of
      mucosal adaptation, type A (56.9%; n = 33), type B (32.8%; n = 19), and type C
      (10.3%; n = 6), were comparable with those reported in adults. The rate of pouch 
      failure and diagnosis of Crohn's disease were similar in each group and were not 
      related to the specific adaptation pattern. Most of the patients with type C
      mucosa had clinical symptoms of pouchitis requiring periodic antibiotic therapy. 
      No dysplasia was identified in any biopsy specimen reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Similar
      morphologic changes can be seen in ileal pouches in pediatric and adult patients.
      There seemed to be no increased risk of dysplasia in children and young adults
      who had undergone ilial pouch-anal anastomosis surgery for ulcerative colitis
      during a 5 year follow-up. Because the long-term risk of development of dysplasia
      is unknown, an initial screening should be performed 5 years after the creation
      of a pelvic pouch in children or when the total disease duration exceeds 7 years.
      Once identified, patients with Type C mucosa should have annual screening for
      dysplasia until further data become available.

TI  - The influence of the colon on postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 (7-36) amide
      concentration in man.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone of the
      enteroinsular axis released rapidly after meals despite the fact that GLP-1
      secreting cells (L-cells) occur predominantly in the distal gut. The importance
      of these colonic L-cells for postprandial GLP-1 was determined in healthy control
      subjects and in ileostomy patients with minimal small bowel resection (<5 cm).
      Subjects were fed a high complex carbohydrate test meal (15.3 g starch) followed 
      by two carbohydrate-free, high fat test meals (25 g and 48.7 g fat respectively).
      Circulating levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon, glucose insulinotrophic peptide
      (GIP) and GLP-1 were measured over a 9-h postprandial period. For both subject
      groups the complex carbohydrate test meal failed to elicit a rise in either GIP
      or GLP-1. However, both hormones were elevated after the fat load although the
      GLP-1 concentration was significantly reduced in the ileostomist group when
      compared with controls (P=0.02). Associated with this reduction in circulating
      GLP-1 was an elevation in glucagon concentration (P=0.012) and a secondary rise
      in the plasma glucose concentration (P=0.006). These results suggest that the
      loss of colonic endocrine tissue is an important determinant in the postprandial 
      GLP-1 concentration. Ileostomists should not be assumed to have normal
      enteroinsular function as the colon appears to have an important role in
      postprandial metabolism.

PG  - 102-5
AB  - We report two cases of manganese (Mn) intoxication during total parenteral
      nutrition including manganese (Mn). Both patients showed parkinsonism with
      psychiatric symptoms and elevated serum Mn levels. T1-weighted magnetic resonance
      images (MRI) revealed symmetrical high intensity lesions in the globus pallidus. 
      Discontinuation of Mn supplementation and levodopa treatment improved the
      symptoms and MRI abnormalities in the both patients. Thus, careful attention
      should be paid to the long-term intravenous administration of Mn.

TI  - Sulphation and secretion of the predominant secretory human colonic mucin MUC2 in
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased synthesis of the predominant secretory human colonic mucin 
      (MUC2) occurs during active ulcerative colitis. AIMS: To study possible
      alterations in mucin sulphation and mucin secretion, which could be the cause of 
      decreased mucosal protection in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Colonic biopsy
      specimens from patients with active ulcerative colitis, ulcerative colitis in
      remission, and controls were metabolically labelled with [35S]-amino acids or
      [35S]-sulphate, chase incubated and analysed by SDS-PAGE, followed by
      quantitation of mature [35S]-labelled MUC2. For quantitation of total MUC2, which
      includes non-radiolabelled and radiolabelled MUC2, dot blotting was performed,
      using a MUC2 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Between patient groups, no significant
      differences were found in [35S]-sulphate content of secreted MUC2 or in the
      secreted percentage of either [35S]-amino acid labelled MUC2 or total MUC2.
      During active ulcerative colitis, secretion of [35S]-sulphate labelled MUC2 was
      significantly increased twofold, whereas [35S]-sulphate incorporation into MUC2
      was significantly reduced to half. CONCLUSIONS: During active ulcerative colitis,
      less MUC2 is secreted, because MUC2 synthesis is decreased while the secreted
      percentage of MUC2 is unaltered. Furthermore, sulphate content of secreted MUC2
      is unaltered by a specific compensatory mechanism, because sulphated MUC2 is
      preferentially secreted while sulphate incorporation into MUC2 is reduced.

TI  - Perioperative growth hormone treatment and functional outcome after major
      abdominal surgery: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study.
PG  - 298-302
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate short- and long-term effects of perioperative human growth
      hormone (hGH) treatment on physical performance and fatigue in younger patients
      undergoing a major abdominal operation in a normal postoperative regimen with
      oral nutrition. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Muscle wasting and functional impairment
      follow major abdominal surgery. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with ulcerative
      colitis undergoing ileoanal J-pouch surgery were randomized to hGH (12 IU/day) or
      placebo treatment from 2 days before to 7 days after surgery. Measurements were
      performed 2 days before and 10, 30, and 90 days after surgery. RESULTS: The total
      muscle strength of four limb muscle groups was reduced by 7.6% in the hGH group
      and by 17.1% in the placebo group at postoperative day 10 compared with baseline 
      values. There was also a significant difference between treatment groups in total
      muscle strength at day 30, and at the 90-day follow-up total muscle strength was 
      equal to baseline values in the hGH group, but still significantly 5.9% below in 
      the placebo group. The work capacity decreased by approximately 20% at day 10
      after surgery, with no significant difference between treatment groups. Both
      groups were equally fatigued at day 10 after surgery, but at day 30 and 90 the
      hGH patients were less fatigued than the placebo patients. During the treatment
      period, patients receiving hGH had reduced loss of limb lean tissue mass, and 3
      months after surgery the hGH patients had regained more lean tissue mass than
      placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative hGH treatment of younger patients
      undergoing major abdominal surgery preserved limb lean tissue mass, increased
      postoperative muscular strength, and reduced long-term postoperative fatigue.

TI  - Experiences with 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine therapy in pediatric patients 
      with severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of 6-mercaptopurine combined with azathioprine in
      treating severe ulcerative colitis has been shown in several adult studies.
      Reported pediatric experiences are rare. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the safety and the potential efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine and
      azathioprine in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis in a pediatric
      population. METHODS: The medical records of patients with active ulcerative
      colitis who were under observation at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
      its satellite clinics from January 1984 through December 1997 were
      retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included who had received a diagnosis of 
      ulcerative colitis, who met no criteria for Crohn's colitis, and who had received
      treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. They were then analyzed for the
      development of side effects, the indication to use 6-mercaptopurine and
      azathioprine, and the ability to discontinue corticosteroid use in those patients
      taking 5-acetylsalicylic acid products who were corticosteroid-dependent or whose
      disease was refractory to treatment. Excluded from the corticosteroid analyses
      were patients who underwent surgery for their disease and patients treated with
      5-acetylsalicylic acid only. Statistical analysis was performed by the
      Kaplan-Meier survival curve and paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: In a review of 
      200 medical records of patients with active ulcerative colitis, 20 patients met
      the criteria. The patients' average age at the initiation of treatment with
      6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine was 13.8 years. Sixteen patients (80%) were
      corticosteroid dependent and 3 (15%) had ulcerative colitis refractory to
      corticosteroid treatment. One patient had severe colitis treated with
      5-acetylsalicylic acid only. Discontinuation of corticosteroid was accomplished
      in 12 (75%) of 16 patients. The median time to discontinuation of corticosteroid 
      after initiation of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine therapy was 8.4 months.
      Eight patients (67%), observed from 3 months to 65 months, have continued without
      corticosteroid therapy. Side effects included pancreatitis and shingles that
      resulted in discontinuation of 5-acetylsalicylic acid, leukopenia corrected by
      withholding 6-mercaptopurine, and self-resolved hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: The data 
      support the safety of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine use in the treatment of
      pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis; side effects were minimal and
      reversible. Eighteen (90%) of 20 patients tolerated the therapy well. The results
      also show that 12 (75%) of 16 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis will
      benefit from the use of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine after initial
      discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. Although 6-mercaptopurine and
      azathioprine may not prevent further relapses, medical management of these flares
      may be less intense and may not require long-term corticosteroid use. Prospective
      clinical trials in pediatric patients are necessary to delineate further the role
      of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine in pediatric ulcerative colitis.
