AB  - Soon after birth, the human gastrointestinal tract quickly becomes colonised by a
      variety of bacterial species. Throughout life the gastrointestinal tract
      continues to serve as host to a complex society of nonpathological bacteria.
      Microorganisms, such as probiotics, have the potential to modulate mucosal immune
      response and reduce gastrointestinal inflammation caused by a variety of
      infectious and allergic events. The most widely studied genera of probiotics are 
      lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Lactobacillus rhamnosis strain ATC53103 (LGG)
      can replenish gut flora during infectious diarrhoeal episodes. This beneficial
      effect is carried over to traveller's diarrhoea and children experiencing
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Furthermore, LGG can reduce the risk of
      respiratory tract infections in children attending daycares and hospitals. With
      allergic disease on the rise, probiotics have the potential to positively impact 
      atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. LGG has been shown to decrease 
      the severity and delay the onset of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, LGG is
      beneficial in the treatment of allergic colitis and necrotising entercolitis.
      Some strains of probiotics appear to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention
      of allergic disease, however, caution must be used when generalising the
      effectiveness of a specific strain of organism to other organisms and other
      disease states.

AB  - UNLABELLED: A quasi-experimental clinical assay was carried out to assess the
      tolerance, safety and usefulness of a 4 lactobacili + 1 bifidobacterium
      combination as adjuvant to the pharmacological treatment of UC Ulcerative colitis
      patients differing in mucosal change. The effectiveness of the probiotic
      treatment was assessed from changes in patient's stool pattern, body composition,
      and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity and nutritional status.
      Fifty patients entered consecutively in the trial between December 2005-June 2009
      (CONTROL GROUP: 29; Treatment Group: 21). Twenty of them completed treatment with
      probiotics. Effectiveness of regular pharmacological treatment was recorded with 
      24 control patients. Thirty-six days of probiotic treatment per patient were
      accumulated. Probiotic treatment obedience rate was 99.3%. Five days of treatment
      were lost due to non-availability of the product. No adverse reactions were
      reported after probiotic treatment. Two deaths were recorded after completion of 
      the study, one on each group. Improvement in the quality of the stools [RR
      Relative risk: 1.69; 95% IC: 0.87-3.27]; frequency [RR: 1.35; 95% IC:
      0.15-11.90]; and volume [RR: 1.11; 95% IC: 0.16-7.63] was observed in treated
      patients, although biological variability prevented these trends to become
      statistically significant. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of
      occurrence of nocturnal depositions [RR: 1.75; 95% IC: 0.53-5.73]. Probiotic
      treatment prevented the onset of undesirable changes in stool pattern of treated 
      patients who presented free of symptoms, but observed effect was no superior to
      that of medication administered. Probiotic treatment did not influence upon
      presence of blood in stools. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of
      disease activity and ESR Erythro-sedimentation rate, respectively [Change in the 
      Clinical Activity Index: CONTROL GROUP: -1.1 +/- 3.2 vs. Treatment Group: -4.1
      +/- 3.3; p < 0.05; Change in ESR: CONTROL GROUP: 3.6 +/- 16.4 vs. Treatment
      Group: -6.7 +/- 15.6; p < 0.05]. Adjuvant probiotic treatment resulted in
      increase of body weight, at the expenses of increase of MAMC Mid-arm Muscle
      Circumference and sum of skinfolds. Probiotic effect upon body weight was not
      attributed to increased food intakes in treated patients. In spite of clinical
      heterogeneity associated to mucosal damage in UC, probiotic treatment might
      result in beneficial effects upon patient's stool pattern, body composition, and 
      selected biochemical indicators of disease activity. Invariance of food intakes
      could imply that observed changes in response variables were not the result of a 
      placebo effect of used probiotic combination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do 
      not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs.
      Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable
      or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of
      nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to
      corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to
      identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series
      and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach
      relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose,
      and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate,
      thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional 
      therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin
      in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may
      respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence
      base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in pediatrics.
PG  - 1217-31
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2548 [doi]
AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine
      production by human intestinal cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative
      real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory
      (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1,
      TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines.
      They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative
      colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from
      healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni,
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella 
      typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with 
      the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic
      species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA.
      CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different
      cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study
      and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in
      contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards 
      our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the 
      pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.

      Diagnosis and treatment].
PG  - A1899
AB  - The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for
      adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the
      literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development.
      The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected
      with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting
      diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which
      the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course,
      ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the
      'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease
      assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable
      unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment 
      is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time
      maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both
      treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is
      ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically
      significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if
      complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or
      complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary
      therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive
      nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in
      preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has
      no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal
      carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic
      surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated
      according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time
      elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.

AB  - Immunomodulatory properties of 10 dairy propionibacteria, analyzed on human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), revealed a highly strain-dependent
      induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). Two selected
      strains of Propionibacterium freudenreichii showed a protective effect against
      two models of colitis in mice, suggesting a probiotic potential predicted by
      immune-based selection criteria for these cheese starter bacteria.

TI  - New insights into IBD epidemiology: Are there any lessons for treatment?
PG  - 406-10
LID - 10.1159/000320394 [doi]
AB  - Changing trends in the epidemiology of IBD provide an opportunity to examine
      possible etiological hypotheses. Why did IBD emerge in developed nations in the
      middle of the 20th century? Why did it emerge initially as ulcerative colitis but
      now Crohn's disease has become the predominate form of IBD in developed nations? 
      Why is IBD emerging in recent years in developing nations and why is it that
      ulcerative colitis is the predominate form in these countries? In this chapter we
      will explore what is known about environmental issues that impact on disease
      presentation and where they provide opportunities for therapy. Managing smoking
      cessation in Crohn's disease is substantiated by evidence showing that smokers
      have a worse course of disease than non-smokers or than persons who quit smoking.
      Introducing nicotine to patients with ulcerative colitis has not brought the
      positive results anticipated with the widespread observation that smoking
      cessation was associated with flaring of this disease. Assessing and managing
      stress in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has emerged as an important
      consideration for clinicians caring for patients with IBD, especially for
      patients with active disease who may develop maladaptive coping mechanisms.
      Recent data suggest that stress may antedate flares. It is unknown what may
      induce changes in the gut flora of patients with IBD compared to controls. There 
      are suggestions that antibiotic use in childhood and specific diets particularly 
      those lower in omega-3 fatty acids may impact on disease presentation and the
      common mechanism may be through alteration of gut flora. For at-risk families
      (where there are affected family members) perhaps greater vigilance with
      antibiotic use in childhood and ensuring diets are higher in omega-3 fatty acids 
      can be considered. In the future there may be approaches to modulate gut flora
      either with antibiotics targeted against identified noxious microbes or with
      selective probiotics that can rebalance the gut dysbiosis.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of pouchitis and ileoanal pouch dysfunction.
PG  - 485-94
LID - 10.1007/s11894-010-0143-y [doi]
AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become
      the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC with dysplasia and for the majority of patients
      with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, UC patients with IPAA are
      susceptible to inflammatory and noninflammatory sequelae, such as pouchitis,
      Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, and irritable pouch syndrome, in addition
      to common surgery-associated complications, which adversely affect the surgical
      outcome and compromise health-related quality of life. Pouchitis is the most
      frequent long-term complication of IPAA in patients with UC, with a cumulative
      prevalence of up to 50%. Pouchitis may be classified based on the etiology into
      idiopathic and secondary types, and the management is often different.
      Pouchoscopy is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential
      diagnosis in patients with pouch dysfunction. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay 
      of treatment for active pouchitis. Some patients may develop dependency on
      antibiotics, requiring long-term maintenance therapy. Although management of
      antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been challenging,
      secondary etiology for pouchitis should be evaluated and modified, if possible.

AB  - Understanding the importance of the fecal microbiota has been key in
      understanding the pathophysiology of some infectious diarrheas. In addition to
      normal protective measures of bile, gastric acid, and immune response, among
      others, we now know that the healthy gut flora protects us from some infectious
      diarrheas. Antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) is an excellent example, as
      antibiotics perturb the normal flora; the resulting diarrhea may be due to
      changes in short chain fatty acid metabolism. A severe form of AAD is due to
      Clostridium difficile, a pathogen that can cause severe diarrhea, colitis and
      even death. Recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea is a difficult clinical
      problem to treat successfully because one recurrence makes further recurrences
      more likely, probably because antibiotics are still needed to treat and thus the 
      fecal flora remains abnormal. There is no single effective treatment but
      therapies include pulsed and tapered antibiotics, the probiotic Saccharomyces
      boulardii as an adjunct to antibiotics, and even fecal flora reconstitution. It
      is likely that we will learn even more in the future about the beneficial effect 
      of our microbiota.

      case-control study.
PG  - 2099-108
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics 
      and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular
      probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study
      comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients 
      and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and
      prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In
      total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly
      more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health
      (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001).
      Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds
      ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI
      1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients
      the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 
      1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P 
      = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a
      probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with
      healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of
      information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health
      but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely 
      on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to 
      healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about 
      probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.

PG  - 4145-51
AB  - AIM: To demonstrate the therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and their effect on inflammatory mediators and nuclear
      factor (NF)-kappaB activation in these patients. METHODS: Thirty patients with
      mild to moderate UC were randomly classified into two groups: sulfasalazine
      group, who received sulfasalazine 2400 mg/d; and probiotic group, who received
      sulfasalazine 2400 mg/d with probiotic. The patients were investigated before and
      after 8 wk of treatment with probiotic (Lactobacillus delbruekii and
      Lactobacillus fermentum). Colonic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assayed
      with UV spectrophotometry, the colonic content of interleukin (IL)-6 was
      determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fecal calprotectin was
      determined by ELISA, and expression of NF-kappaB p65 and tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha proteins in colonic tissue was identified by immunohistochemistry and
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: At the
      start of the study, colonic mucosal injury and inflammation were demonstrated in 
      UC patients by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and an increase in colonic MPO
      activity, fecal calprotectin, and expression of colonic TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB
      p65 proteins. The use of probiotic for 8 wk significantly ameliorated the
      inflammation by decreasing the colonic concentration of IL-6, expression of
      TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB p65, leukocyte recruitment, as demonstrated by a decrease
      in colonic MPO activity, and the level of fecal calprotectin compared to
      sulfasalazine group and the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral
      supplementation with probiotics could be helpful in maintaining remission and
      preventing relapse of UC.

      of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Although it has been suggested that probiotic
      supplementation is an effective approach to colitis, its effects on intestinal
      flora and on mucosal cytokine balance have never been explored. AIM: To evaluate 
      the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) DG, a probiotic strain, on
      colonic-associated microbiota, mucosal cytokine balance, and toll-like receptor
      (TLR) expression. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with mild left-sided UC were
      randomly allocated to one of three groups for an 8-week treatment period: the
      first group of 7 patients received oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone, the 
      second group of 8 patients received oral 5-ASA plus oral L. casei DG, and the
      third group of 11 patients received oral 5-ASA and rectal L. casei DG. Biopsies
      were collected from the sigmoid region to culture mucosal-associated microbes and
      to assess cytokine and TLR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: 5-ASA alone or together with oral L.
      casei DG failed to affect colonic flora and TLR expression in a significant
      manner, but when coupled with rectally administered L. casei DG, it modified
      colonic microbiota by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and reducing
      Enterobacteriaceae. It also significantly reduced TLR-4 and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta mRNA levels and significantly increased mucosal IL-10. CONCLUSIONS:
      Manipulation of mucosal microbiota by L. casei DG and its effects on the mucosal 
      immune system seem to be required to mediate the beneficial activities of
      probiotics in UC patients.

PG  - 285-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1307-1 [doi]
AB  - Radiation therapy has become one of the most important treatment modalities for
      human malignancy, but certain immediate and delayed side-effects on the normal
      surrounding tissues limit the amount of effective radiation that can be
      administered. After exposure of the abdominal region to ionizing radiation,
      nearly all patients experience transient symptoms of irradiation of the bowel.
      Acute-phase symptoms may persist for a short time, yet long-term complications
      can represent significant clinical conditions with high morbidity. Data from both
      experimental studies and clinical trials suggest the potential benefit for
      probiotics in radiation-induced enteritis and colitis. On the other hand, it is
      well evidenced that both useful and harmful effects of therapeutic applications
      of ionizing radiation upon living systems are ascribed to free-radical
      production. Therefore, the hypothesis that probiotics reinforce antioxidant
      defense systems of normal mucosal cells exposed to ionizing radiation may explain
      to an extent their beneficial action. The aim of this review is threefold: First,
      to make a short brief into the natural history of radiation injury to the
      intestinal tract. Second, to describe the primary interaction of ionizing
      radiation at the cellular level and demonstrate the participation of free
      radicals in the mechanisms of injury and, third, to try a more profound
      investigation into the antioxidant abilities of probiotics and prebiotics based
      on the available experimental and clinical data.

PG  - 250-6
LID - 10.1177/0884533610368708 [doi]
AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become the
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial
      polyposis coli syndromes. Pouch construction uses the distal 30-40 cm of ileum,
      and there exists a potential for postoperative nutrition consequences. These
      include vitamin B(12) deficiency, iron deficiency, bile acid malabsorption, and
      abnormalities of trace elements, fluids, and electrolytes. Patients who have
      undergone an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure often describe specific food 
      sensitivities that may require diet alteration, even more so than do patients
      with permanent ileostomy. There may be roles for postoperative probiotic
      supplementation in an attempt to decrease the rate of "pouchitis" and appropriate
      preoperative nutrition support to minimize the risk of perioperative
      complications.

TI  - Treatment of relapsing mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis with the probiotic
      VSL#3 as adjunctive to a standard pharmaceutical treatment: a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 2218-27
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: VSL#3 is a high-potency probiotic mixture that has been used
      successfully in the treatment of pouchitis. The primary end point of the study
      was to assess the effects of supplementation with VSL#3 in patients affected by
      relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC) who are already under treatment with
      5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) and/or immunosuppressants at stable doses. METHODS: A
      total of 144 consecutive patients were randomly treated for 8 weeks with VSL#3 at
      a dose of 3,600 billion CFU/day (71 patients) or with placebo (73 patients).
      RESULTS: In all, 65 patients in the VSL#3 group and 66 patients in the placebo
      group completed the study. The decrease in ulcerative colitis disease activity
      index (UCDAI) scores of 50% or more was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the
      placebo group (63.1 vs. 40.8; per protocol (PP) P=0.010, confidence interval
      (CI)(9)(5)(%) 0.51-0.74; intention to treat (ITT) P=0.031, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.47-0.69). Significant results with VSL#3 were recorded in an improvement of
      three points or more in the UCDAI score (60.5% vs. 41.4%; PP P=0.017, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.51-0.74; ITT P=0.046, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.47-0.69) and in rectal bleeding (PP
      P=0.014, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.46-0.70; ITT P=0.036, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.41-0.65), whereas
      stool frequency (PP P=0.202, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.39-0.63; ITT P=0.229, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.35-0.57), physician's rate of disease activity (PP P=0.088, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.34-0.58; ITT P=0.168, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.31-0.53), and endoscopic scores (PP
      P=0.086, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.74-0.92; ITT P=0.366, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.66-0.86) did not show 
      statistical differences. Remission was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the
      placebo group (47.7% vs. 32.4%; PP P=0.069, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.36-0.60; ITT P=0.132,
      CI(9)(5)(%) 0.33-0.56). Eight patients on VSL#3 (11.2%) and nine patients on
      placebo (12.3%) reported mild side effects. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 supplementation is
      safe and able to reduce UCDAI scores in patients affected by relapsing
      mild-to-moderate UC who are under treatment with 5-ASA and/or immunosuppressants.
      Moreover, VSL#3 improves rectal bleeding and seems to reinduce remission in
      relapsing UC patients after 8 weeks of treatment, although these parameters do
      not reach statistical significance.

TI  - The angiogenic effect of probiotic Bacillus polyfermenticus on human intestinal
      microvascular endothelial cells is mediated by IL-8.
PG  - G999-G1008
AB  - Angiogenesis is required for wound healing and repair, but dysregulated
      angiogenesis is involved in gastrointestinal inflammation. Bacillus
      polyfermenticus (B.P.) is a probiotic bacterium clinically used for a variety of 
      intestinal disorders in East Asia. Here we investigated the effect of B.P. on
      angiogenesis of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) and
      wound healing in intestinal mucosa. Exposure of HIMECs to the conditioned medium 
      of B.P. cultures (B.P. CM) increased cell migration, permeability, and tube
      formation. Production of the proangiogenic cytokine IL-8 was increased by B.P.
      CM, and neutralizing antibodies against IL-8 or IL-8 receptor CXCR2 reduced tube 
      formation as well as actin stress fiber formation. B.P. CM also increased
      NF-kappaB activation, and inhibitors of NF-kappaB suppressed B.P. CM-induced tube
      formation and IL-8 production. Furthermore, B.P. facilitated recovery of mice
      from colitis as shown by increased body weight and reduced rectal bleeding and
      histological severity. B.P. also increased angiogenesis and mouse IL-8 production
      in the mucosal layer. Collectively, these results show that B.P. increases
      angiogenesis of HIMECs in a NF-kappaB/IL-8/CXCR2-dependent manner. Moreover, B.P.
      promotes angiogenesis in the mucosa during recovery of mice from colitis,
      suggesting that this probiotic may be clinically used to facilitate intestinal
      wound healing.

AB  - The widely used probiotic bacteria belong to the genera Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium and have in most cases been isolated from the human
      gastrointestinal tract. However, other "less conventional" bacteria, from
      allochthonous or extremophilic origin, sharing similar structural or functional
      features, may also confer specific health benefits to a host. Firstly, we
      explored the in vitro immuno-modulatory or immune-stimulatory activities of 25
      wine lactic acid bacteria belonging to Oenococcus oeni and Pediococcus parvulus. 
      While cytokines released by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated
      by P. parvulus strains, showed little variation, O. oeni strains induced
      strain-specific cytokine patterns. Some O. oeni strains were then further
      analyzed under various conditions for growth, dose and culture medium. In a
      second phase, we evaluated the oral tolerance and safety of two strains of O.
      oeni in mice fed a high dose of bacteria for a week. Finally, evidence was
      gathered on the in vivo anti-inflammatory potential of a selected O. oeni strain 
      using an experimental 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis 
      mouse model. Although results did not match the anti-inflammatory levels obtained
      with certain conventional probiotics, strain IOEB 9115 significantly lowered
      colonic injury and alleviated colitis symptoms. The 'natural' tolerance towards
      acid, ethanol, and phenolic compounds of O. oeni strains combined with a
      measureable immunomodulatory potential, suggest a possible use of selected
      strains isolated from wine as live probiotics.

PG  - 181-92
LID - S0212-16112010000200001 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and
      important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence
      of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis 
      and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary
      treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli,
      regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal
      mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in
      Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible
      (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined
      treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel
      stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of
      either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits
      has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids)
      could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the
      activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising
      results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for
      probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role
      for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral
      component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotic yeasts: anti-inflammatory potential of various non-pathogenic strains
      in experimental colitis in mice.
PG  - 2134-45
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro immunomodulation capacity of various non-pathogenic
      yeast strains and to investigate the ability of some of these food grade yeasts
      to prevent experimental colitis in mice. METHODS: In vitro immunomodulation was
      assessed by measuring cytokines [interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-10, tumor necrosis
      factor and interferon gamma] released by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      after 24 h stimulation with 6 live yeast strains (Saccharomyces ssp.) and with
      bacterial reference strains. A murine model of acute 2-4-6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis was next used to evaluate the distinct prophylactic 
      protective capacities of three yeast strains compared with the performance of
      prednisolone treatment. RESULTS: The six yeast strains all showed similar
      non-discriminating anti-inflammatory potential when tested on immunocompetent
      cells in vitro. However, although they exhibited similar colonization patterns in
      vivo, some yeast strains showed significant anti-inflammatory activities in the
      TNBS-induced colitis model, whereas others had weaker or no preventive effect at 
      all, as evidenced by colitis markers (body-weight loss, macroscopic and
      histological scores, myeloperoxidase activities and blood inflammatory markers). 
      CONCLUSION: A careful selection of strains is required among the biodiversity of 
      yeasts for specific clinical studies, including applications in inflammatory
      bowel disease and other therapeutic uses.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprise Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
      indeterminate colitis, generally beginning in young subjects and increasing in
      frequency in Western countries. Despite their still unknown aetiologies, some
      pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated after the recent discovery of numerous
      susceptibility genes and rare environmental factors. These diseases have a course
      consisting of episodes of flare-up alternating with periods of remission. Medical
      treatment for induction of a remission comprises besides aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids including budesonide and immunosuppressive drugs, anti-TNF-alpha 
      drugs (infliximab, adalimumab) indicated in case of failure of previous
      therapies. Surgery is indicated for complications and failure of medical
      treatment.With current therapy, most of the patients are able to fulfil their
      familial, social and professional projects.

PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-10-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are effective in inflammatory bowel diseases. Clinical
      effectiveness and dose dependency of E. coli Nissle (EcN) enemas were
      investigated in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In a double-blind study, 90
      patients with moderate distal activity in UC were randomly assigned to treatment 
      with either 40, 20, or 10 ml enemas (N = 24, 23, 23) containing 10E8 EcN/ml or
      placebo (N = 20). The study medication was taken once daily for at least 2 weeks.
      After 2, 4 and/or 8 weeks the clinical DAI was assessed together with tolerance
      to treatment. Patients who reached clinical DAI <or= 2 within that time were
      regarded as responders. RESULTS: According to ITT analysis the number of
      responders was not significantly higher in the EcN group than in the placebo
      group (p = 0.4430, 2-sided). However, the Jonckheere-Terpstra rank correlation
      for dose-dependent efficacy indicated a significant correlation of per-protocol
      responder rates (p = 0.0446, 2-sided). Time to remission was shortest with EcN 40
      ml, followed by EcN 20 ml. The number of adverse events did not differ notably.
      CONCLUSION: In contrast to ITT analysis, efficacy of rectal EcN application was
      significant in PP and points to EcN as a well tolerated treatment alternative in 
      moderate distal UC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register

      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1908-15
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the induction of remission and maintenance effects of probiotics
      for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Information was retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The induction of remission and
      promotion of maintenance were compared between probiotics treatment and
      non-probiotics treatment in ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized
      controlled studies met the selection criteria. Seven studies evaluated the
      remission rate, and eight studies estimated the recurrence rate; two studies
      evaluated both remission and recurrence rates. Compared with the non-probiotics
      group, the remission rate for ulcerative colitis patients who received probiotics
      was 1.35 (95% CI: 0.98-1.85). Compared with the placebo group, the remission rate
      of ulcerative colitis who received probiotics was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35-2.96).
      During the course of treatment, in patients who received probiotics for less than
      12 mo compared with the group treated by non-probiotics, the remission rate of
      ulcerative colitis was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.07-1.73). Compared with the non-probiotics
      group, the recurrence rate of ulcerative colitis patients who received probiotics
      was 0.69 (95% CI: 2.47-1.01). In the mild to moderate group who received
      probiotics, compared to the group who did not receive probiotics, the recurrence 
      rate was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.51). The group who received Bifidobacterium bifidum
      treatment had a recurrence rate of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.50) compared with the
      non-probiotics group. CONCLUSION: Probiotic treatment was more effective than
      placebo in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Update on the role of probiotics in the therapy of pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Probiotics have had many applications in the past few years, and inflammatory
      conditions of the GI tract--including chronic disorders such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD)--have received the most attention by investigators. In fact, 
      the experimental basis to expect clinical efficacy of probiotics in IBD is quite 
      robust. In spite of this however, only minimal evidence of benefit by any
      probiotic is currently available in Crohn's disease, either in adult or in
      pediatric populations. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, several
      probiotic formulations and especially the proprietary preparation VSL#3 (a
      high-concentration mixture) have been found effective as adjuvant therapy, both
      in inducing and maintaining remission.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and
      contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live
      nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance,
      particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces
      boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods.
      Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including
      lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic
      organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated 
      with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest
      evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment
      of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research
      is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
      There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be
      ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically
      contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut
      colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well
      tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be
      used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised 
      or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely
      occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at
      least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing 
      and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the
      gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often 
      conflicting.

TI  - A comprehensive review of post-market clinical studies performed in adults with
      an Asian probiotic formulation.
PG  - 93-106
LID - 10.3920/BM2008.1005 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics as dietary supplements have been readily accepted by Asian
      populations. Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number
      of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western
      scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of
      Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on
      post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these
      publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the
      clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been
      used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel
      syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and
      mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and 
      to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs
      require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The
      information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical
      information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected
      outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore,
      identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better 
      clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.

PG  - 345-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1249168 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics exert distinct effects on the intestinal mucosa and the immune system 
      that can be used in preventive and therapeutic settings. There is evidence to
      support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and
      pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to
      ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of
      probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics
      are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel
      syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role
      in nutrient fermentation and energy metabolism and may be helpful in the
      prevention and therapy of obesity.

TI  - Immunosuppressive effects via human intestinal dendritic cells of probiotic
      bacteria and steroids in the treatment of acute ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1286-98
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) gut bacteria drive inflammation. Bacterial
      recognition and T-cell responses are shaped by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs); 
      therapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria may relate to modulation of intestinal 
      DC. The probiotic mixture, VSL#3, increases interleukin (IL)-10 and downregulates
      IL-12p40 production by DC in vitro. We evaluated in vivo effects of oral VSL#3
      and steroids on colonic DC in patients with acute UC. METHODS: Rectal biopsies
      were obtained from patients with active UC before and after treatment with VSL#3,
      corticosteroids, or placebo, and from healthy controls. Myeloid colonic DC were
      studied from freshly isolated lamina propria cells using multicolor flow
      cytometry. Surface expression of activation markers, CD40, CD86, pattern
      recognition receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 were assessed.
      Changed function was measured from ongoing intracellular IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-6,
      and IL-13 production. RESULTS: Acute UC colonic myeloid DC were producing more
      IL-10 and IL-12p40 than control DC (P = 0.01). In VSL#3-treated patients DC TLR-2
      expression decreased (P < 0.05), IL-10 production increased and IL-12p40
      production decreased (P < 0.005); 10/14 patients on VSL#3 showed a clinical
      response. Corticosteroids also resulted in increased IL-10 and reduced IL-12p40
      production by DC. Conversely, in patients on placebo, TLR-2 expression and
      intensity of staining for IL-12p40 and IL-6 increased (all P < 0.05); 5/14
      patients on placebo showed a clinical response (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Despite
      small numbers of human colonic DC available, we showed that treatment of UC
      patients with probiotic VSL#3 and corticosteroids induced "favorable" intestinal 
      DC function in vivo, increasing regulatory cytokines and lowering proinflammatory
      cytokines and TLR expression. These effects may contribute to therapeutic
      benefit.

TI  - Probiotics for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.
PG  - 565-71
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M498 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence for probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission 
      of ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search
      (1948-November 2009) was conducted using ulcerative colitis and probiotics as
      terms for identifying pertinent studies. Search limits included English language 
      and humans. Additional information was obtained from bibliographies. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Prospective trials published in English and
      conducted in adults were included. Two open-label and 3 double-blind randomized
      trials evaluated probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission of UC. Clinical and
      surrogate markers for maintaining remission of UC were assessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      A relationship between immune response and gastrointestinal microbials appears to
      be involved in the mechanism of UC. Trial results comparing the probiotic
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to mesalazine have reported equivalent rates of UC
      relapse. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain alone or in combination
      with mesalazine resulted in a nonsignificant odds ratio decrease for relapse and 
      a significant increase in time to relapse compared to treatment with mesalazine
      alone. Additionally, bifidobacteria-fermented milk-supplemented patients had
      significant reductions in UC exacerbations when compared to nonsupplemented
      patients. Probiotics were well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar
      between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Studies evaluating probiotics for maintaining
      remission of UC are limited by trial design and use of different probiotics with 
      variable bacterial contents. Thus, questions remain regarding optimal probiotic, 
      dosing, specific patient populations, and placement in therapy. To answer these
      questions, large, randomized, controlled trials need to be conducted before
      probiotics can be routinely recommended for maintaining remission of UC.

PG  - S228-34

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are the result of an abnormal immune response to
      environmental factors including the intestinal microbiota. Epithelial and immune 
      cells of the intestinal mucosa recognise specific bacterial molecules via Toll
      like and NOD like receptors and this interaction modulates the inflammatory
      response (activation of the NF-kappaB pathway). It is thus rational to try
      treatments which could modify the intestinal microbiota i.e. antibiotics, new
      substrates (prebiotics) or new micro-organisms (probiotics). We review the
      literature on existing evidence for the efficacy of probiotic strains or
      combinations in patients with pouchitis (good evidence), ulcerative colitis (fair
      evidence), and Crohn's disease (no evidence at the present time). We also discuss
      the mechanisms of action, the use of microbial agents as pharmacological vectors,
      the development of genetically modified probiotics (including a clinical pilot
      trial in patients with Crohn's disease), and safety issues.

TI  - Defensin-immunology in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S137-44
LID - 10.1016/S0399-8320(09)73149-5 [doi]
AB  - Defensins are endogenous antibiotics with microbicidal activity against
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses and protozoa. 
      A disturbed antimicrobial defense, as provided by Paneth- and other epithelial
      cell defensins, seems to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Conspicuously, there is a relative lack of Paneth cell
      beta-defensins HD-5 and HD-6 in ileal Crohn's disease, both in the absence of a
      pattern recognition receptor NOD2 mutation and, even more pronounced, in its
      presence. This deficit is independent of concurrent active inflammation and
      results in a diminished antibacterial killing by the mucosa. The Crohn's disease 
      mucosa has not only a significant lack in killing different Escherichia coli but 
      also an impaired ability in clearing Staphylococcus aureus as well as anaerobic
      micro-organisms. Thus, this dysfunction in antibacterial barrier seems to be
      broad and is not restricted to a single bacterial strain. In addition to directly
      controlling barrier function, Paneth cell defensins also regulate the composition
      of the bacterial stool flora. In the majority of patients, the Paneth cell
      deficiency is mediated by WNT signalling which suggests a disturbed Paneth cell
      differentiation in ileal Crohn's disease. In contrast, colonic Crohn's disease is
      characterised by an impaired induction of mucosal beta-defensins, partly due to a
      low copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster. Therefore it seems plausible
      that bacteria take advantage of a niche formed by defensin deficiency. This would
      represent a paradigm shift in understanding Crohn's disease and provides a target
      for future therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics:
      probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the functional disorder
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 690S-7S
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.113746 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically
      mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains
      have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to
      be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems
      effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome 
      is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural
      abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted
      appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show
      positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect
      is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of
      inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.

AB  - A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) complicated by

      steroid therapy or antibiotics. Although the patient's UC failed to respond to
      several types of induction therapy, his condition finally improved when treated
      using Bifidobacterium. Probiotics could be one of the treatment agents for
      induction of remission in UC.

TI  - Therapeutic options to modulate barrier defects in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 450-4
LID - 10.1159/000233283 [doi]
AB  - In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), epithelial barrier function is impaired
      contributing to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism and perpetuating inflammation
      by an increased luminal antigen uptake. This barrier of the intestinal epithelium
      is composed of the apical enterocyte membrane and the epithelial tight junction
      (TJ) and can be affected by TJ alterations, induction of epithelial apoptosis and
      appearance of gross lesions like erosions or ulcers as well as by accelerated
      transcytotic antigen uptake. TJ strands are reduced in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      strand breaks appear. Several of the 24 claudins are concerned in CD as e.g.
      claudin-2, -5 and -8. The epithelial apoptotic rate has also been shown to be
      elevated causing focal lesions. As far as regulation is concerned, Th1 cytokines 
      like TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma are important for CD, while Th2 responses are
      dominated by interleukin (IL)-13 and TNF-alpha in ulcerative colitis (UC). IL-13 
      does stimulate epithelial apoptosis as well as upregulates claudin-2 in UC.
      Together with an IL-13-dependent restitution arrest, this may explain why ulcer
      lesions are seen already early in UC but only in advanced stages of CD. Luminal
      antigen uptake occurs via TJ discontinuities, epithelial gross lesions and
      endocytotically. Therapeutically, anti-inflammatory remedies as e.g. TNF-alpha
      antibodies are most effective in improving active IBD and in parallel repairing
      barrier function. Again, this is assumed to be due to reduced cytokine release in
      active IBD, as a result of immune cell apoptosis. However, other agents can also 
      directly affect barrier function. Glutamine is discussed as a candidate for
      barrier therapy but has never been shown to have a direct barrier influence in
      CD, although it is an important metabolic fuel for enterocytes and has been shown
      to preserve barrier functions in laboratory models. Also, probiotics and TGF-beta
      and have beneficial effects in models, but no data exist on barrier repair in
      IBD. In contrast, zinc has been shown to improve barrier function in CD, although
      the inherent mechanisms are unknown. Finally, food components can strengthen the 
      epithelial barrier as for example the flavonoid quercetin which has been shown to
      upregulate claudin-4 within the epithelial TJ.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefits of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in an
      extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (EHCF) in improving hematochezia and fecal 
      calprotectin over EHCF alone. STUDY DESIGN: Fecal calprotectin was compared in 30
      infants with hematochezia and 4 weeks after milk elimination with that of a
      healthy group. We also compared fecal calprotectin and hematochezia on 26
      formula-fed infants randomly assigned to EHCF with LGG (Nutramigen LGG) (EHCF +
      LGG) or without (Nutramigen) (EHCF - LGG) and on 4 breastfed infants whose
      mothers eliminated dairy. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin in those with hematochezia 
      was significantly higher than in comparisons (mean +/- SD 325.89 +/- 152.31 vs
      131.97 +/- 37.98 microg/g stool, t = 6.79, P < .0001). At 4 weeks, fecal
      calprotectin decreased to 50% of baseline but was still significantly higher than
      in comparisons (157.5 +/- 149.13 vs 93.72 +/- 36.65 microg/g, P = .03). Fecal
      calprotectin mean decrease was significantly larger among EHCF + LGG compared
      with EHCF - LGG (-214.5 +/- 107.93 vs -112.7 +/- 105.27 microg/g, t = 2.43, P =
      .02). At 4 weeks, none of the EHCF + LGG had blood in stools, and 5/14 on EHCF - 
      LGG did (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Fecal calprotectin is elevated in infants with
      hematochezia and possible allergic colitis. EHCF + LGG resulted in significant
      improvement of hematochezia and fecal calprotectin compared with the EHCF alone.

PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmm.2009.08.004 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and
      health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric
      commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of
      IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown.
      The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota 
      has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be
      further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics
      approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the
      microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut
      microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the
      development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as
      contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the
      beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce
      immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to
      moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of 
      the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and
      its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the
      immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern
      recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells
      (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be
      discussed.

TI  - Do probiotics have a role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 155-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease treatments have generally revolved around
      immunological manipulations to reduce inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Bacterial interactions with the gastrointestinal epithelium may be a trigger for 
      inflammatory changes which occur in the gut. Antibiotics have been shown to alter
      disease activity in Crohn's disease. Probiotics (live microorganisms)
      administered for therapeutic purposes have been proposed due to the possibility
      of their altering the interaction of the gut mucosa with enteric bacteria.
      Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials
      indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific
      inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis. Trials in Crohn's disease have shown mixed results.

TI  - Evolving concepts in Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most important cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea. The emergence of a hypervirulent strain and other factors including
      antibiotic overuse contribute to the increasing incidence and severity of this
      potentially lethal infection. CDI has been reported in persons previously
      considered as low risk, such as young healthy persons without exposure to health 
      care settings or antibiotics, peripartum women, and children. In patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, the risk of C. difficile infection is even greater,
      with higher rates of hospitalization, bowel surgery, and mortality. With
      increasing incidence and severity of disease, the need for improved diagnostic,
      treatment, and infection control strategies cannot be overstated.

TI  - Probiotic-induced changes in the intestinal epithelium: implications in
      gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - There is resurgent interest in the use of probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal
      and systemic health, driven by recent advances in knowledge of bacterial
      interactions with the epithelium and innate immune system of the intestine. The
      effects of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal epithelium and their downstream
      consequences are reviewed. Probiotics prevent pathogen adherence and invasion of 
      the epithelium, partly by blocking adherence sites but also by upregulating gene 
      expression of MUC2 and of antimicrobial peptides. Metabolic effects of probiotics
      on the intestinal epithelium include production of short chain fatty acids which 
      influence epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis. Bacterial
      metabolism of unabsorbed dietary constituents with production of free radicals
      and phenolic metabolites can lead to DNA damage and cancer; probiotics restore
      eubiosis and potentially prevent this. Probiotics alter expression and
      redistribution of tight junction proteins and reduce intestinal permeability
      limiting absorption of noxious molecules from the gut lumen. Most studied are the
      effects of probiotics on epithelial cells which are the first line of innate
      immune-capable cells that encounter luminal flora. Probiotics, through secreted
      molecules, influence the innate inflammatory response of epithelial cells to
      stimuli from the gut lumen, and reduce mucosal inflammation. Through effects on
      dendritic, and possibly epithelial, cells they influence naive T cells in the
      lamina propria of the gut and thus influence adaptive immunity. These varied
      effects of probiotics have implications for the treatment of several
      gastrointestinal diseases including antibiotic-associated colitis, acute
      gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

TI  - Comparison of the immunomodulatory properties of three probiotic strains of
      Lactobacilli using complex culture systems: prediction for in vivo efficacy.
PG  - e7056
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0007056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the use of probiotics to treat or prevent inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) has been proposed, to this point the clinical benefits have been
      limited. In this report we analyzed the immunological activity of three strains
      of Lactobacillus to predict their in vivo efficacy in protecting against
      experimental colitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the
      immunological properties of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826, L. rhamnosus GG
      (LGG), L. paracasei B21060 and pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium (SL1344). We
      studied the stimulatory effects of these different strains upon dendritic cells
      (DCs) either directly by co-culture or indirectly via conditioning of an
      epithelial intermediary. Furthermore, we characterized the effects of these
      strains in vivo using a Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of colitis. We found 
      that the three strains exhibited different abilities to induce inflammatory
      cytokine production by DCs with L. plantarum being the most effective followed by
      LGG and L. paracasei. L. paracasei minimally induced the release of cytokines,
      while it also inhibited the potential of DCs to both produce inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-12 and TNF-alpha) and to drive Th1 T cells in response to
      Salmonella. This effect on DCs was found under both direct and indirect
      stimulatory conditions - i.e. mediated by epithelial cells - and was dependent
      upon an as yet unidentified soluble mediator. When tested in vivo, L. plantarum
      and LGG exacerbated the development of DSS-induced colitis and caused the death
      of treated mice, while, conversely L. paracasei was protective. CONCLUSIONS: We
      describe a new property of probiotics to either directly or indirectly inhibit DC
      activation by inflammatory bacteria. Moreover, some immunostimulatory probiotics 
      not only failed to protect against colitis, they actually amplified the disease
      progression. In conclusion, caution must be exercised when choosing a probiotic
      strain to treat IBD.

AB  - Probiotics have been used to treat human gastrointestinal inflammations including
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the exact mechanisms by which
      probiotics act to protect against intestinal inflammation have yet to be fully
      elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of
      Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris FC using in vivo and in vitro inflammation
      models. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of 3% dextran
      sulfate sodium to drinking water. In the cellular level assessment, a gut
      inflammation model with the co-culture system consisting Caco-2 cells and
      RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS was used. Administration of L. lactis subsp.
      cremoris FC significantly ameliorated shortening of colon length and histological
      score of the colon in DSS-induce colitis mice. In addition, the treatment of L.
      lactis subsp. cremoris FC improved the aberrant mRNA expression in inflamed
      tissue near to control level through notable suppression of TNF-alpha (P<0.05),
      IFN-gamma (P<0.05), IL-6, iNOS, and MIP-2 mRNA expression. In addition, in a gut 
      inflammation model, treatment with L. lactis subsp. cremoris FC resulted in
      significant down-regulation of IL-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells and
      inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings
      indicate that administration of L. lactis subsp. cremoris FC improves negative
      effects of DSS-induced colitis in mice through the inhibition of inflammatory
      cell infiltration.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), are immunologically mediated with genetic and
      environmental influences. Genetic factors include defective immunoregulation,
      mucosal integrity/repair and bacterial killing. Commensal bacteria activate
      pathogenic bacterial antigen-specific effector T cells that cause chronic
      inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts but induce protective immune
      responses in normal subjects. Both host and microbial specificities are
      important. Some bacterial species are aggressive, some are neutral and others
      protective, but each species has different effects in various hosts. Molecular
      techniques demonstrate contraction of certain bacterial populations in IBD,
      especially clostridial subsets, and expansion of others, including
      Enterobacteriaceae. The balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial species
      determines homeostasis vs. inflammation; this balance can be manipulated by
      antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics to treat and prevent relapses of IBD.
      Adherent/invasive Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and
      resist killing by macrophages are increased in ileal CD. HYPOTHESIS: Invasive,
      translocating, intracellular commensal bacteria induce Th1 and Th17 responses
      that cause CD in susceptible individuals with genetically determined innate
      immune defects. UC is caused by bacterial metabolic products that induce
      epithelial injury by blocking epithelial metabolism or overwhelming the
      genetically susceptible host's ability to degrade reactive oxygen species.

TI  - Balsalazide in treating colonic diseases.
PG  - 1555-63
LID - 10.1517/17425250903228842 [doi]
AB  - Balsalazide is the newer 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) prodrug which releases
      active 5-ASA only into the colon with minimal systemic absorption. The onset of
      action of this drug is variable, and it may take at least some days to reach
      clinical effectiveness. Clinical studies found balsalazide faster than mesalazine
      in the induction of remission, but balsalazide has no benefit compared with
      mesalazine in preventing relapse in the population selected. However, the high
      number of pills to take may affect the adherence to the treatment. This 5-ASA
      prodrug may be effectively used also in patients unable to tolerate other
      mesalamine compounds for non-hypersensitivity reasons. The costs of balsalazide
      capsules seem to be lower for the health system, both considering total direct
      healthcare costs and better outcomes, compared with patients treated with oral
      mesalazine. Finally, there is also some recent evidence that balsalazide may be
      effectively used, in combination with probiotics, in treating acute uncomplicated
      diverticulitis is the colon.

TI  - Bacillus polyfermenticus ameliorates colonic inflammation by promoting
      cytoprotective effects in colitic mice.
PG  - 1848-54
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.108613 [doi]
AB  - Although human consumption of Bacillus polyfermenticus provides several health
      benefits, the probiotic effect of this bacterium against colonic inflammation has
      not yet, to our knowledge, been studied. Therefore, we induced colitis in mice by
      oral or intrarectal administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or
      trinitrobenzenosulfonic acid (TNBS), respectively, and investigated the effect of
      B. polyfermenticus on colitis. We found that mice treated with DSS or TNBS along 
      with B. polyfermenticus had reduced mortality and severity of colitis (weight
      loss, diarrhea, and mucosal damages) than mice treated with DSS or TNBS alone. B.
      polyfermenticus also reduced the expression of inflammatory molecules, including 
      chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, intercellular adhesion molecule, and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, but enhanced the expression of the antiinflammatory
      cytokine interleukin-10 in the inflamed mouse colon. Moreover, B. polyfermenticus
      suppressed apoptosis both in vivo in inflamed colonic mucosa and in vitro in
      colonic epithelial cells stimulated with apoptosis-inducing agents (FasL or
      Clostridium difficile Toxin A) when the apoptotic response was determined by a
      terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and cleavage
      of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or caspase-3, respectively. Treating colonic
      epithelial cells with B. polyfermenticus-conditioned medium (BPCM) enhanced cell 
      proliferation and induced the phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt signaling pathway,
      suggesting that this bacterium can promote epithelial cell proliferation. BPCM
      also promoted the migration of colonic epithelial cells. These data suggest that 
      B. polyfermenticus ameliorates colonic inflammation by suppressing apoptosis and 
      promoting epithelial cell proliferation and migration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder
      of the colon for which the etiology is currently unknown. At present, strategies 
      to treat UC are primarily targeted to control inflammation during active phases
      of disease as well as maintain remission during quiescence. As such, several
      unmet needs in the treatment of UC still remain. In recent years, basic research 
      has led to the recognition of several key factors in the pathogenesis of UC,
      translating into the development of several novel therapeutic agents. OBJECTIVE: 
      The aim of this study is to review emerging therapies that may advance the
      treatment and improve the overall care of UC patients. METHODS: An extensive
      literature search on published manuscripts and meeting proceedings has been
      performed to provide a comprehensive review of future drug therapies to treat UC.
      RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The translational application of new discoveries in the basic
      understanding of UC pathogenesis is continuing and critical for the development
      of novel treatment strategies. Design of novel biologic therapies to treat UC has
      the challenge of addressing potential safety issues, while more traditional drugs
      should be further developed to facilitate patient compliance to treat this
      chronic, debilitating disease.

TI  - Survival of the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) in the
      gastrointestinal tract given in combination with oral mesalamine to healthy
      volunteers.
PG  - 256-62
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesalamine and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) are both
      effective agents for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. A combined therapy may 
      have more than additive efficacy. However, mesalamine may have antimicrobial
      effects on EcN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 48 healthy volunteers took EcN in a
      run-in phase for 17 days (5-50 x 10(9) viable bacteria od). If stool samples
      became positive for EcN, volunteers received combination treatment with EcN plus 
      either mesalamine (1500 mg twice a day) or placebo for 1 week. Fecal samples were
      further tested for EcN in 2- to 3-day intervals until a maximum of 48 weeks after
      treatment. Patient diaries, blood, and urine were checked to assess safety,
      compliance, and tolerance. RESULTS: During run-in, viable EcN were detected in 45
      of the 48 volunteers (94%); 2 volunteers were positive before taking EcN. From
      days 1 to 7 of combination treatment (n = 40), the number of EcN-positive
      volunteers varied between 70% and 80% in the mesalamine group and between 85% and
      95% in the placebo group. Differences between the groups were not significant
      (normal approximation: day 3, P > 0.15; day 5, P > 0.25; day 7, P > 0.076). At
      treatment discontinuation, 16 of 20 volunteers in the mesalamine group and 15 of 
      20 volunteers in the placebo group were EcN positive, whereas this figure dropped
      continuously up to week 12 after discontinuation (mesalamine, 7 of 20; placebo, 4
      of 20). No differences between the groups were seen with regard to tolerance and 
      safety. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of EcN and mesalamine has no significant
      effect on the survival of EcN in healthy volunteers.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics can maintain ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission
      effectively, but little is known of their ability to induce remission. We
      conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 
      high-potency probiotic, VSL#3, for the treatment of mild-to-moderately active UC.
      METHODS: Adult patients with mild-to-moderate UC were assigned randomly to groups
      that were given 3.6 x 10(12) CFU VSL#3 (n = 77) or placebo (n = 70), twice daily 
      for 12 weeks. The primary end point was a 50% decrease in the Ulcerative Colitis 
      Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) at 6 weeks. The secondary end points included
      remission by 12 weeks and reduction in total individual UCDAI parameters from
      baseline at 12 weeks. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: At week
      6, the percentage of patients with an improvement in UCDAI score that was greater
      than 50% was significantly higher in the group given VSL#3 (25; 32.5%) than the
      group given placebo (7; 10%) (P = .001). At week 12, there were 33 patients given
      VSL#3 (42.9%) who achieved remission, compared with 11 patients given placebo
      (15.7%) (P < .001). Furthermore, significantly more patients given VSL#3 (40;
      51.9%) achieved a decrease in their UCDAI that was greater than 3 points,
      compared with those given placebo (13; 18.6%) (P < .001). The VSL#3 group had
      significantly greater decreases in UCDAI scores and individual symptoms at weeks 
      6 and 12, compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 is safe and
      effective in achieving clinical responses and remissions in patients with
      mild-to-moderately active UC.

AB  - The term "probiotic" was first used in 1965, by Lilly and Stillwell, to describe 
      substances secreted by one organism which stimulate the growth of another. The
      use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy and irradiation, amongst other
      means of treatment, may cause alterations in the composition and have an effect
      on the GIT flora. Therefore, the introduction of beneficial bacterial species to 
      GI tract may be a very attractive option to re-establish the microbial
      equilibrium and prevent disease. Prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient
      that confers benefits on the host by selectively stimulating one bacterium or a
      group of bacteria in the colon with probiotic properties. Both probiotics and
      prebiotics are together called as Synbiotics. Various bacterial genera most
      commonly used in probiotic preparations are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium,
      Escherichia, Enterococcus, Bacillus and Streptococcus . Some fungal strains
      belonging to Saccharomyces have also been used. Probiotics have been shown to be 
      effective in varied clinical conditions- ranging from infantile diarrhoea,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, relapsing Clostridium
      difficle colitis, Helicobacter pylori infections, inflammatory bowel disease to
      cancer, female uro-genital infection and surgical infections. Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus strain GG has proven beneficial affects on intestinal immunity. It
      increases the number of IgA and other immunoglobulins secreting cells in the
      intestinal mucosa. It also stimulates local release of interferons. It
      facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid cells, which serves to
      increase antigen uptake in Peyer's patches. Probiotics are live microorganisms,
      so it is possible that they may result in infection in the host. The risk and
      morbidity of sepsis due to probiotic bacteria should be weighed against the
      potential for sepsis due to more pathological bacteria and the morbidity of
      diseases for which probiotic bacteria are being used as therapeutic agents. Also,
      future, well-designed placebo controlled studies with validated results are
      required for ascertaining the true health benefits of probiotics The important
      point in this regard is careful selection of the probiotic agent, its dose
      standardization and a thorough knowledge of its beneficial effects.

TI  - The first case of antibiotic-associated colitis by Clostridium difficile PCR
      ribotype 027 in Korea.
PG  - 520-4
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2009.24.3.520 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a common causative agent of
      pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) ranges
      from mild diarrhea to life threatening PMC. Recently, a highly virulent strain of
      C. difficile polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 was found in North America,
      Europe, and Japan. A 52-yr-old woman with anti-tuberculosis medication and
      neurogenic bladder due to traffic accident experienced five episodes of C.
      difficile PMC after taking antibiotics for pneumonia along with septic shock and 
      acute renal failure. She was readmitted to the intensive care unit and treated
      with oral vancomycin with refractory of oral metronidazole, inotropics and
      probiotics for over 60 days. C. difficile isolated both at the first and the last
      admission was identified as C. difficile ribotype 027 by ribotyping,
      toxinotyping, and tcdC gene sequencing, which turned out the same pathogen as the
      epidemic hypervirulent B1/NAP1 strain. This is the first case of C. difficile PCR
      ribotype 027 in Korea. After discharge, she was maintained on probiotics and
      rifaximin for 3 weeks. She had no relapse for 6 months.

PG  - 175-82

AB  - Probiotic bacteria, commensals selected for their presumed therapeutic properties
      when ingested orally, have attracted increasing attention for their possible
      efficacy in a range of gastrointestinal disorders, including the inflammatory
      bowel diseases of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since the barrier
      properties of the intestinal epithelium are believed to be compromised as a
      consequence (or perhaps as a cause) of intestinal inflammation, we hypothesized
      that probiotics might ameliorate such epithelial dysfunction as part of their
      spectrum of beneficial effects. We have used both cell line and animal models to 
      test this hypothesis and show that two probiotics have significant effects on
      epithelial barrier properties, both at baseline and when deranged by inflammatory
      cytokines or in the setting of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis.
      Moreover, the probiotics also normalize epithelial ion transport function, which 
      could also contribute to clinical efficacy. Overall, our studies extend the
      spectrum of functional effects attributable to probiotics, and may provide a
      rationale for their use in a range of gastrointestinal disorders associated with 
      epithelial dysfunction.

TI  - The therapeutic impact of manipulating microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2074-86
AB  - It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal
      microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration
      of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome 
      of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher 
      risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore,
      probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use
      due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This
      review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role 
      of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD,
      and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.

TI  - Targeting the human microbiome with antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics:
      gastroenterology enters the metagenomics era.
PG  - 2015-31
AB  - Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our
      knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our
      understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is
      refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of
      human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions.
      Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity,
      relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of
      nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the
      composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of
      gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the
      gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics,
      probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress
      undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing 
      microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host.
      Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to
      maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these
      approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific
      disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies
      to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
      colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.

TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus alleviates intestinal barrier dysfunction in part by
      increasing expression of zonula occludens-1 and myosin light-chain kinase in
      vivo.
PG  - 2400-8
LID - 10.3168/jds.2008-1698 [doi]
AB  - The effects of lactobacilli on impaired intestinal barrier function and
      paracellular permeability were evaluated in human epithelial Caco-2 cells treated
      with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and in mice with colitis induced by dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS). Filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers were used as the intestinal 
      epithelial model. Among the 4 lactobacilli studied, Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      OLL2838 most effectively suppressed barrier impairment and increased IL-8
      secretion induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in Caco-2 cells; however, the
      conditioned medium from OLL2838 did not show any effect on barrier functions. The
      in vivo effects of OLL2838 on intestinal epithelial barrier function and colonic 
      inflammation were assessed in DSS-induced colitis of BALB/c mice. Oral treatment 
      with both live and heat-killed OLL2838 suppressed weight loss and recovered colon
      length. Additionally, barrier function was restored by the administration of live
      and heat-killed OLL2838 to the DSS-treated animals, which conferred protection
      against the increase in mucosal permeability associated with DSS-induced colitis.
      This may at least partially be because of the increased expression of zonula
      occludens-1 (4.8-fold) and myosin light-chain kinase (3.1-fold) in intestinal
      epithelial cells isolated from mice of the heat-killed OLL2838 group. Therefore, 
      L. rhamnosus OLL2838 would be useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: why, when, and how.
PG  - 329-33
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32832b20bf [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal
      bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in
      their treatment. The implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also 
      examined. RECENT FINDINGS: The hypothesis that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis
      could be a causative agent of Crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large
      trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active
      against this bacterium. An increased number of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli
      have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease, but
      their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. The
      combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a
      reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option
      to decrease the recurrence of postoperative Crohn's disease in high-risk
      patients. However, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may
      induce disease relapse due to Clostridium difficile infection. SUMMARY: Recent
      literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in Crohn's
      disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. The efficacy of
      antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature,
      except in severe colitis. More trials are needed to support the use of probiotics
      as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1528-36
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two principal forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The root causes of these chronic and acute
      immunological disorders are unclear, but intestinal microorganisms are known to
      play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disease. However, at
      present, there is no clear evidence for a single transmissible agent being
      involved in IBD aetiology. Although marked alterations occur in faecal and
      mucosal bacterial communities in IBD, it is unclear whether they are responsible 
      for causing disease, or are due to changes in the gut environment that result
      from inflammatory reactions and extensive tissue destruction. Despite the
      involvement of microorganisms in inflammatory processes, antibiotic therapy has
      generally been unsuccessful in IBD. However, recent studies involving the use of 
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics suggest that there is potential for
      controlling these diseases through manipulation of the composition of the gut
      microbiota, and direct interactions with the gut immune system.

TI  - Probiotics, immune function, infection and inflammation: a review of the evidence
      from studies conducted in humans.
PG  - 1428-518
AB  - A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various
      probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters,
      infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of
      the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and
      mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by 
      some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation,
      the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear 
      less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of
      diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition.
      Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults,
      but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious
      outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are
      less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic
      supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk
      and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early
      supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from
      studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans
      is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects
      seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of
      probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the
      subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements 
      were made.

TI  - Effect of Candida colonization on human ulcerative colitis and the healing of
      inflammatory changes of the colon in the experimental model of colitis ulcerosa.
PG  - 107-18
AB  - The influence of fungal colonization on the course of ulcerative colitis (UC) has
      not been thoroughly studied. We determined the activity of the disease using
      clinical, endoscopic and histological index (IACH) criteria in UC patients with
      fungal colonization and the healing process of UC induced by an intrarectal
      administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats infected with
      Candida, without and with antifungal (fluconazole) or probiotic (lacidofil)
      treatment. The intensity of the healing of the colonic lesions was assessed by
      macro- and microscopic criteria as well as functional alterations in colonic
      blood flow (CBF). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) content and plasma proinflammatory
      cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated. Candida more frequently
      colonized patients with a history of UC within a 5-year period, when compared
      with those of shorter duration of IBS. Among Candida strains colonizing
      intestinal mucosa, Candida albicans was identified in 91% of cases. Significant
      inhibition of the UC activity index as reflected by clinical, endoscopical and
      histological criteria was observed in the Candida group treated with fluconazole,
      when compared to that without antifungal treatment. In the animal model, Candida 
      infection significantly delayed the healing of TNBS-induced UC, decreased the CBF
      and raised the plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels, with these effects reversed 
      by fluconazole or lacidofil treatment. We conclude that 1) Candida delays healing
      of UC in both humans and that induced by TNBS in rats, and 2) antifungal therapy 
      and probiotic treatment during Candida infection could be beneficial in the
      restoration and healing of colonic damage in UC.

TI  - Use of probiotics in the management of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: a case
      study.
PG  - 569-70
LID - 10.1177/0148607109332004 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in
      response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral
      chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining.
      Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have
      gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief
      communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer
      patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a
      multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated
      with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies
      combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and
      Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study
      demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different
      probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of
      study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that
      probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.

TI  - Commensal bacteria can enter colonic epithelial cells and induce proinflammatory 
      cytokine secretion: a possible pathogenic mechanism of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 535-45
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.005801-0 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin 2 (IL-2)- and IL-10-knockout mice develop spontaneous colitis under
      conventional but not germ-free conditions, suggesting that commensal bacteria
      play an important role in the pathogenesis of colitis. However, interactions
      between commensal bacteria and colonic epithelial cells have not been fully
      investigated. We therefore assessed the ability of various commensal bacteria and
      probiotics to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells. Effects of the
      bacteria on production of proinflammatory cytokines were also measured. Commensal
      bacteria, including mucosal organisms isolated from ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients, such as Fusobacterium varium, reported as a possible pathogen in UC,
      Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli and Clostridium clostridioforme, as well
      as their type strains and probiotics, were assessed for their ability to adhere
      to and invade colonic epithelial cells using two cell lines, SW-480 and HT-29.
      Our experiments employed co-incubation, a combination of scanning and
      transmission electron microscopy and recovery of bacteria from infected-cell
      lysates. F. varium and several other commensal bacteria, but not probiotics,
      adhered to colonic epithelial cells and invaded their cytoplasm. ELISA and
      real-time PCR revealed that the host cells, particularly those invaded by F.
      varium, showed significant increases in IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations in
      supernatants, with elevation of IL-8, TNF-alpha, MCP-1 and IL-6 mRNAs.
      Furthermore, IL-8 and TNF-alpha expression and nuclear phosphorylated NF-kappaB
      p65 expression could be immunohistochemically confirmed in inflamed epithelium
      with cryptitis or crypt abscess in UC patients. Certain commensal bacteria can
      invade colonic epithelial cells, activating early intracellular signalling
      systems to trigger host inflammatory reactions.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The authors present evidence published during the past 2 years
      of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of the
      inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Rodent models conclusively
      implicate commensal enteric bacteria in chronic, immune-mediated, experimental
      colitis, and genetically determined defects in bacterial killing by innate immune
      cells are found in a subset of patients with Crohn's disease. There is no
      evidence that a single pathogen, including Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis, causes Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However,
      adherent/invasive Escherichia coli are associated with ileal Crohn's disease,
      with the mechanisms and genetics of adherent/invasive E. coli virulence being
      elucidated. Molecular characterization of the microbiota in patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases reveals decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria,
      most notably the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, including the clinically
      relevant Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased E. coli concentrations.
      VSL#3 is one probiotic preparation shown to be efficacious in certain clinical
      situations in small clinical trials. SUMMARY: Further characterization of altered
      microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and linking dysbiosis
      with host genetic alterations in immunoregulation, innate microbial killing and
      barrier function are critical, so that individualized treatments to increase
      beneficial commensals and their metabolic products (probiotic and prebiotic
      administration) and diminish deleterious species such as adherent/invasive E.
      coli can be tailored for defined patient subsets.

TI  - Clostridium difficile associated infection, diarrhea and colitis.
PG  - 1554-80
AB  - A new, hypervirulent strain of Clostridium difficile, called NAP1/BI/027, has
      been implicated in C. difficile outbreaks associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality since the early 2000s. The epidemic strain is resistant to
      fluoroquinolones in vitro, which was infrequent prior to 2001. The name of this
      strain reflects its characteristics, demonstrated by different typing methods:
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (NAP1), restriction endonuclease analysis (BI)
      and polymerase chain reaction (027). In 2004 and 2005, the US Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized that the risk of C. difficile-associated 
      diarrhea (CDAD) is increased, not only by the usual factors, including antibiotic
      exposure, but also gastrointestinal surgery/manipulation, prolonged length of
      stay in a healthcare setting, serious underlying illness, immune-compromising
      conditions, and aging. Patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have an elevated
      risk, as do peripartum women and heart transplant recipients. Before 2002, toxic 
      megacolon in C. difficile-associated colitis (CDAC), was rare, but its incidence 
      has increased dramatically. Up to two-thirds of hospitalized patients may be
      infected with C. difficile. Asymptomatic carriers admitted to healthcare
      facilities can transmit the organism to other susceptible patients, thereby
      becoming vectors. Fulminant colitis is reported more frequently during outbreaks 
      of C. difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). C.
      difficile infection with IBD carries a higher mortality than without underlying
      IBD. This article reviews the latest information on C. difficile infection,
      including presentation, vulnerable hosts and choice of antibiotics, alternative
      therapies, and probiotics and immunotherapy. We review contact precautions for
      patients with known or suspected C. difficile-associated disease. Healthcare
      institutions require accurate and rapid diagnosis for early detection of possible
      outbreaks, to initiate specific therapy and implement effective control measures.
      A comprehensive C. difficile infection control management rapid response team
      (RRT) is recommended for each health care facility. A communication network
      between RRTs is recommended, in coordination with each country's department of
      health. Our aim is to convey a comprehensive source of information and to guide
      healthcare professionals in the difficult decisions that they face when caring
      for these oftentimes very ill patients.

AB  - Due to morbidity, mortality, and high costs associated with eradicating
      Clostridium difficile once this organism causes colitis, this bacterium has been 
      termed one of the most ecologically relevant microorganisms of the present day.
      Symptoms associated with C. difficile diarrhea often first present during or
      shortly after a course of antibiotic therapy. During the past 5 years, the
      virulence of this organism has increased. C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) 
      has reached epidemic proportions in some hospital settings, prompting Medicare to
      propose adding CDAD to the list of hospital-acquired conditions for which
      reimbursements may be cut. Thus, it is imperative that effective preventive
      strategies be implemented in hospitals to decrease CDAD infections. It is
      plausible that probiotic supplements may offer a safe and effective means of
      preventing both initial CDAD episodes as well as CDAD recurrences. This review
      critically examines the current literature in which probiotic supplements have
      been studied for efficacy in CDAD prevention. This analysis will guide
      practitioners in applying available probiotic data to CDAD clinical scenarios and
      will assist researchers in the appropriate design of future studies as
      examination continues into the role that probiotics may have in CDAD prevention.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of synbiotic versus probiotic or
      prebiotic treatment to improve the quality of life in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 520-5
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.11.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest that synbiotic therapy could prove more effective in
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) than therapies limited to probiotics or 
      prebiotics. This study compared the effect of each of these therapies in the
      treatment of UC. METHODS: One hundred twenty outpatients with UC were randomly
      sorted into three groups of 40 patients each for probiotic, prebiotic, or
      synbiotic therapy. The probiotic group ingested one daily capsule consisting of
      Bifidobacterium longum 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units and the prebiotic group
      ingested daily 8.0-g doses of psyllium. The synbiotic group underwent both
      treatments. All patients completed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaires
      (IBDQs) at the onset of the trial, at the 2-wk midpoint, and at the 4-wk end of
      the trial. Blood variables were also evaluated in a subset of 32 patients
      randomly selected from all groups and values were compared with IBDQ scores.
      RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the probiotic group, 31 in the prebiotic group,
      and 32 in the synbiotic group qualified for analyses. The remaining 26 patients
      had incomplete questionnaires. Total IBDQ scores improved within groups by the
      end of the trial (probiotics 162 to 169, NS; prebiotics 174 to 182, NS;
      synbiotics 168 to 176, P = 0.03). Individual scores improved as follows:
      probiotics, emotional function (P = 0.03); prebiotics, bowel function (P = 0.04);
      and synbiotics, systemic and social functions (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02).
      C-reactive protein decreased significantly only with synbiotic therapy (from 0.59
      to 0.14 mg/dL, P = 0.04). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients with
      UC on synbiotic therapy experienced greater quality-of-life changes than patients
      on probiotic or prebiotic treatment. These data suggest that synbiotic therapy
      may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of UC.

TI  - Post-translational inhibition of IP-10 secretion in IEC by probiotic bacteria:
      impact on chronic inflammation.
PG  - e4365
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the probiotic mixture 
      VSL#3 has protective activities in the context of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The aim of the study was to reveal bacterial strain-specific molecular
      mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of VSL#3 in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IEC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: VSL#3 inhibited
      TNF-induced secretion of the T-cell chemokine interferon-inducible protein
      (IP-10) in Mode-K cells. Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) cell surface proteins
      were identified as active anti-inflammatory components of VSL#3. Interestingly,
      L. casei failed to block TNF-induced IP-10 promoter activity or IP-10 gene
      transcription at the mRNA expression level but completely inhibited IP-10 protein
      secretion as well as IP-10-mediated T-cell transmigration. Kinetic studies,
      pulse-chase experiments and the use of a pharmacological inhibitor for the export
      machinery (brefeldin A) showed that L. casei did not impair initial IP-10
      production but decreased intracellular IP-10 protein stability as a result of
      blocked IP-10 secretion. Although L. casei induced IP-10 ubiquitination, the
      inhibition of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation did not prevent the loss of
      intracellular IP-10. Most important for the mechanistic understanding, the
      inhibition of vesicular trafficking by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) inhibited IP-10 but
      not IL-6 expression, mimicking the inhibitory effects of L. casei. These findings
      suggest that L. casei impairs vesicular pathways important for the secretion of
      IP-10, followed by subsequent degradation of the proinflammatory chemokine.
      Feeding studies in TNF(DeltaARE) and IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a
      compartimentalized protection of VSL#3 on the development of cecal but not on
      ileal or colonic inflammation. Consistent with reduced tissue pathology in
      IL-10(-/-) mice, IP-10 protein expression was reduced in primary epithelial
      cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate segment specific effects of
      probiotic intervention that correlate with reduced IP-10 protein expression in
      the native epithelium. Furthermore, we revealed post-translational degradation of
      IP-10 protein in IEC to be the molecular mechanism underlying the
      anti-inflammatory effect.

AB  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the
      intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been
      proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to
      nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established
      that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal
      immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the
      physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the
      complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory
      bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate
      immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and
      hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Elevated human beta-defensin-2 levels indicate an activation of the innate immune
      system in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional
      disorder. According to the Rome criteria, macroscopic and histological
      inflammation is a crucial exclusion criterion for IBS. Human defensins appear to 
      be part of the innate immune system in the gastrointestinal tract. Human
      beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) was the first inducible human antimicrobial protein
      discovered. The expression is induced by probiotic microorganisms and
      proinflammatory cytokines. Recent results imply that HBD-2 is expressed in active
      intestinal inflammation, especially in ulcerative colitis (UC). Our aim was to
      evaluate fecal measurements of HBD-2 in patients with active UC and IBS, and in
      healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from a total of
      100 participants (30 with active UC, 46 IBS, and 24 HCs). Exclusion criteria were
      the current use of probiotics and antibiotics. Furthermore, IBS patients with
      elevated C-reactive protein or leukocytes, a history of bacterial overgrowth or
      infectious gastrointestinal disease over the last 6 month were excluded. Disease 
      status was addressed in all participating subjects by medical history and current
      symptoms. In addition, each IBS and UC patient underwent ileocolonoscopy with
      histopathology. Fecal inflammation markers lactoferrin (Lf) and calprotectin
      (Cal) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reported as 
      microg/g. Fecal HBD-2 was measured by ELISA and reported as ng/g feces. In
      addition, immunoblots were performed for fecal HBD-2. Paraffin-embedded tissue
      from colonic biopsies was tested for HBD-2 peptides by immunohistochemistry.
      RESULTS: Lf as well as Cal was elevated in active UC (mean: 152.1+/-s.d. 374.7
      microg/g; 103.5+/-87.1 microg/g), compared with IBS (8.3+/-19.4 microg/g;
      18.6+/-23.3 microg/g), and HCs (0.4+/-0.5 microg/g; 7.1+/-7.9 microg/g). Scheffe 
      post hoc tests revealed significant differences (P=0.006; P<0.001) between active
      UC vs. IBS and HC. In contrast, HBD-2 levels were highest in active UC (mean:
      106.9+/-s.d. 91.5 ng/g), almost as high in IBS (pts 76.0+/-67.9 ng/g), and lowest
      for HCs (29.9+/-16.1 ng/g). Scheffe post hoc tests revealed significant
      differences (P<0.001) between the groups of patients (UC and IBS) vs. HCs.
      Immunohistochemical investigation was consistent with fecal secretion data and
      demonstrated the presence of beta-defensin 2 peptides in colonic epithelial
      enterocytes in UC as well as IBS patients with elevated fecal HBD-2. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results indicate significantly elevated levels of HBD-2 in patients with IBS 
      compared with HCs and similar to those with active UC. The results support an
      activation of the mucosal innate defense system toward a proinflammatory response
      in IBS patients in the absence of macroscopic signs of inflammation.

TI  - Effect of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) on induction and maintenance of
      remission in children with ulcerative colitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several probiotic compounds have shown promise in the therapy of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). However, a strong sustained benefit remains to be seen. 
      Uncontrolled pilot studies suggest that a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) maintains
      remission in mild to moderate UC and reduces active inflammation in adult
      patients. Aims of our prospective, 1-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
      were to assess the efficacy of VSL#3 on induction and maintenance of remission
      and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the probiotic preparation therapy 
      in children with active UC. METHODS: A total of 29 consecutive patients (mean
      age: 9.8 years; range: 1.7-16.1 years; female/male: 13/16) with newly diagnosed
      UC were randomized to receive either VSL#3 (weight-based dose, range: 450-1,800
      billion bacteria/day; n=14) or an identical placebo (n=15) in conjunction with
      concomitant steroid induction and mesalamine maintenance treatment. Children were
      prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, 
      and 1 year after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. Lichtiger colitis activity 
      index and a physician's global assessment were used to measure disease activity. 
      At baseline, within 6 months and 12 months or at the time of relapse, all
      patients were assessed endoscopically and histologically. RESULTS: All 29
      patients responded to the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induction therapy.
      Remission was achieved in 13 patients (92.8%) treated with VSL#3 and IBD therapy 
      and in 4 patients (36.4%) treated with placebo and IBD therapy (P<0.001).
      Overall, 3 of 14 (21.4%) patients treated with VSL#3 and IBD therapy and 11 of 15
      (73.3%) patients treated with placebo and IBD therapy relapsed within 1 year of
      follow-up (P=0.014; RR=0.32; CI=0.025-0.773; NNT=2). All 3 patients treated with 
      VSL#3 and 6 of 11 (54.5%) patients treated with placebo relapsed within 6 months 
      of diagnosis. At 6 months, 12 months, or at time of relapse, endoscopic and
      histological scores were significantly lower in the VSL#3 group than in the
      placebo group (P<0.05). There were no biochemical or clinical adverse events
      related to VSL#3. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first pediatric, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial that suggests the efficacy and safety of a highly
      concentrated mixture of probiotic bacterial strains (VSL#3) in active UC and
      demonstrates its role in maintenance of remission.

AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate
      amounts, confer a health benefit on the host, including the gastrointestinal
      tract. While this beneficial effect was originally thought to stem from
      improvements in the intestinal microbial balance, there is now substantial
      evidence that probiotics can also provide benefits by modulating immune
      functions. In animal models, probiotic supplementation is able to provide
      protection from spontaneous and chemically induced colitis by downregulating
      inflammatory cytokines or inducing regulatory mechanisms in a strain-specific
      manner. In animal models of allergen sensitization and murine models of asthma
      and allergic rhinitis, orally administered probiotics can strain-dependently
      decrease allergen-specific IgE production, in part by modulating systemic
      cytokine production. Certain probiotics have been shown to decrease airway
      hyperresponsiveness and inflammation by inducing regulatory mechanisms. Promising
      results have been obtained with probiotics in the treatment of human inflammatory
      diseases of the intestine and in the prevention and treatment of atopic eczema in
      neonates and infants. However, the findings are too variable to allow firm
      conclusions as to the effectiveness of specific probiotics in these conditions.

AB  - This article presents a literature review of side effects of antihelikobakter
      therapy, as well as survey data, whose goal was to determine the efficacy and
      safety of normoflorins at patients after eradication therapy of peptic ulcer. It 
      was shown that the frequency of occurrence of side effects during
      antihelikobakter therapy varies widely and can reach, according to different
      authors, from 30 to 50% of patients. In addition to allergic and toxic PE, with
      antibacterial agents allocate their influence on the microflora of the colon,
      which often leads to development of a scarce and dysbacteriosis of
      antibioticassociated colitis. Appointment of biodiesel of normoflorin after
      eradication therapy effectively suppresses clinical signs of dyspepsia as a side 
      effect of antihelikobakter therapy enhances the effectiveness of treatment of
      patients and improve their quality of life.

PG  - 111-4
LID - 10.1159/000268130 [doi]
AB  - The notion that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role for the development of
      intestinal inflammation, initially based on a series of clinical observations
      both in human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis, has been
      reinforced by a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the abnormal
      recognition of bacterial and other microbiota antigens by the innate immune
      system is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. In keeping with our present knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease
      pathophysiology, the search for therapeutic approaches aimed at modifying the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota to obtain new, more targeted treatments 
      for inflammatory bowel disease that are basically free of side effects has been a
      subject of intense research activity. Probiotics are defined as live organisms
      capable of conferring health benefits beyond their nutritional properties.
      Numerous micro-organisms have been evaluated to induce or maintain remission, or 
      both, in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Overall, probiotics
      have successfully demonstrated some efficacy in some inflammatory bowel disease
      scenarios. However, a critical review of the available scientific literature
      shows that: (1) in spite of great expectations, reflected by a high number of
      review and editorial articles in top journals, the number of published,
      well-designed clinical trials using probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease is
      small, often with few patients; (2) the range of microbial agents makes it
      particularly difficult to draw global conclusions; (3) the quality of the
      evidence on the efficacy of probiotics in pouchitis is clearly better than that
      in ulcerative colitis, while there is virtually no evidence of probiotic efficacy
      in Crohn's disease. The appropriate selection of probiotic agents combined with
      convincing clinical trials will determine whether probiotics can jump from
      promise to reality in inflammatory bowel disease clinical practice.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two principal forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal studies show that bacteria are involved 
      in the etiology of IBD, and much is now known about the inflammatory processes
      associated with CD and UC, as well as the underlying genetic, environmental, and 
      lifestyle issues that can affect an individual's predisposition to these
      diseases. However, while a number of candidate microorganisms have been put
      forward as causative factors in IBD, the primary etiologic agents are unknown.
      This review discusses the potential role of luminal and mucosal microbial
      communities in the etiology of IBD, and outlines studies that have been made
      using a variety of biotherapeutic therapies, involving the use of antibiotics,
      probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.

TI  - Interventions for treating microscopic colitis: a Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Review Group systematic review of
      randomized trials.
PG  - 235-41; quiz 234, 242
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2008.16 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to determine effective treatments for 
      patients with collagenous colitis or lymphocytic colitis, the two subtypes of
      microscopic colitis. METHODS: Relevant papers were identified via the MEDLINE,
      PUBMED, and Cochrane Collaboration databases, manual searches of the references
      of identified papers and review papers on microscopic colitis, as well as
      searches of abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings. RESULTS: All
      studies assessing treatment of microscopic colitis had relatively small sample
      sizes. A total of 10 randomized trials included patients with collagenous
      colitis. Budesonide was studied for induction of response in three trials and for
      maintenance of response in two trials. The pooled odds ratio for inducing
      clinical response with budesonide was 12.32 (95% confidence interval, CI
      5.53-27.46), and for maintaining clinical response was 8.82 (95% CI 3.19-24.37), 
      with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2 patients for each outcome. Budesonide
      also induced and maintained histological response and was well tolerated. Bismuth
      subsalicylate, prednisolone, and mesalamine with or without cholestyramine may be
      effective, whereas Boswellia serrata extract and probiotics were ineffective for 
      treating collagenous colitis. Three randomized trials included patients with
      lymphocytic colitis. Budesonide was shown in one study to be effective for
      inducing clinical response (OR 9.00; 95% CI 1.98-40.93), with an NNT of three
      patients. Budesonide also induced histological response and was well tolerated.
      Bismuth subsalicylate and mesalamine with or without cholestyramine may be
      effective for treating lymphocytic colitis. No trials assessed maintenance of
      response in patients with lymphocytic colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is
      effective and well tolerated for inducing and maintaining clinical and
      histological responses in patients with collagenous colitis, and for inducing
      clinical and histological responses in patients with lymphocytic colitis.
      Determining the magnitude of benefit is limited by the small sample sizes of the 
      studies. The evidence for other agents, including bismuth subsalicylate,
      prednisolone, B. serrata extract, probiotics, and mesalamine with or without
      cholestyramine is weaker. It is not clear that any of these agents induce or
      maintain actual remission of collagenous or lymphocytic colitis, as opposed to
      clinical or histological response.

TI  - Probiotic preparation VSL#3 induces remission in children with mild to moderate
      acute ulcerative colitis: a pilot study.
PG  - 760-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      that has periods of exacerbated symptoms and periods that are symptom-free. The
      treatment of active UC with probiotic bacteria could possibly induce remission.
      We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety profile of probiotic preparation
      VSL#3 in the treatment of mild to moderate acute UC in the pediatric population. 
      METHODS: Eighteen eligible patients between the ages of 3-17 with mild to
      moderate acute UC received open-label VSL#3 daily in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks.
      The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was assessed by the simple
      clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI); Mayo ulcerative colitis endoscopic
      score; inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive 
      protein (CRP); serum cytokine profiling; and rectal tissue microbial profiling
      done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed 8 weeks of
      VSL#3 treatment and 5 patients were withdrawn due to lack of improvement.
      Remission (defined as SCCAI <or=3) was achieved in 56% of children (n = 10);
      response (decrease in SCCAI >or=2, but final score <or=5) in 6% (n = 1); and no
      change or worsening in 39% (n = 7). Post-VSL#3 treatments demonstrated a
      bacterial taxonomy change in rectal biopsy. The VSL#3 was well tolerated in
      clinical trials and no biochemical and clinical adverse effects attributed to
      VSL#3 were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of pediatric patients diagnosed
      with mild to moderate UC with VSL#3 resulted in a remission rate of 56% and a
      combined remission/response rate of 61%.

TI  - Prebiotics in chronic intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 454-62
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20737 [doi]
AB  - Prebiotics are nondigestible fermentable fibers that are reported to have health 
      benefits for the host. Older as well as more recent studies show beneficial
      effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic
      pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the benefits of prebiotics in
      rodent IBD models and in IBD patients and discuss their possible protective
      mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic
      intestinal inflammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the
      current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinflammatory immune
      response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes
      the composition of the intestinal microflora toward more protective intestinal
      bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy
      for IBD targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging.
      Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to
      administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational 
      applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary
      prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human IBD will need 
      to be confirmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.
