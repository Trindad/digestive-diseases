AB  - Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea 
      that is usually treated adequately with standard treatment of metronidazole or
      vancomycin. Relapse or recurrent infection can occur in certain patients and this
      can be very difficult to treat.

TI  - Assessment of mucosal inflammation and blood flow in response to four weeks'
      intervention with probiotics in patients operated with a J-configurated
      ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA).
PG  - 1228-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition in patients operated 
      on with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA). A disturbed mucosal perfusion in the
      pouch has been suggested as a possible cause. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has
      been used successfully to measure gastric and colonic mucosal perfusion in
      humans. In a previous study, we demonstrated a reduced mucosal perfusion in the
      distal part of the pouch, during probiotic intervention, examined by LDF
      measurement. The aim of the present study was to confirm our previous results in 
      a much larger material, and to compare the results of LDF measurements and
      inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with those in familial 
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. METHODS: Five hundred millilitres of a
      fermented milk product (Cultura), containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and
      bifidobacteria (Bb-12), was given daily for 4 weeks to 41 UC and 10 patients with
      FAP, operated on with IPAA. Mucosal perfusion was measured with LDF and the
      degree of inflammation was examined at predefined levels of the distal bowel by
      histology and faecal calprotectin measurements both before and after
      intervention. We also evaluated the applicability of a Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index (PDAI). RESULTS: The LDF measurements were reproducible in the pelvic pouch
      at each of the predefined levels, but did not change during intervention. Mucosal
      perfusion was significantly reduced in the distal compared to the proximal part
      of the pouch in the UC group (P < 0.05). The perfusion levels were higher in the 
      FAP patients compared to the UC patientsat all predefined levels (P < 0.05).
      Calprotectin levels and histological score did not change significantlyafter
      intervention in any of the groups. The calprotectin level was significantly lower
      in the FAP compared to the UC group both before and after intervention. The PDAI 
      decreased in both groups from alevel considered diagnostic for pouchitis to a
      level considered as not active pouchitis. The decreasewas significant for the UC 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results did not demonstrate an effect of probiotics on
      histology, although a significant effect on the PDAI was achieved, which concurs 
      with the previously reported effect on symptoms and endoscopic score. The
      significantly reduced blood flow in the UC group compared to the FAP group,
      operated on with the same procedure, and the significantly increased calprotectin
      levels in the UC group, are original findings. Both findings may be related to an
      increased risk for pouchitis among UC patients. The lack of effect of
      intervention on mucosal perfusion does not exclude a role for reduced circulation
      as a cause of pouchitis based on the reduced LDF measurements in the distal part 
      of the pouch.

TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 99-111; discussion 111-4, 211-8
AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics are the sort of therapy that most patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) wish for. They are without significant side
      effects, except possibly an increase in gas with prebiotics, and so far, appear
      to be entirely safe. However, are they effective? More than a dozen studies using
      probiotics in IBD have now been reported, and there is dear benefit in pouchitis 
      and possibly also in Crohn's, although there are so many clinical types of this
      condition that a clear indication has yet to emerge. For ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      more studies are needed. The use of prebiotics in IBD is only just starting,
      although significant effects on both the luminal and mucosa-associated flora have
      been demonstrated in healthy subjects. Antibiotics offer more certain hope in IBD
      treatment, although with a much greater risk of unwanted effects. Their efficacy 
      in clinical studies varies, with Crohn's disease and pouchitis reporting more
      benefit than ulcerative colitis. However, the ideal combination of antibiotics,
      and rationale for their use has not been determined.

TI  - Clostridium difficile-associated colitis.
PG  - 1536-40, 1543-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the basic microbiology, pathogenesis of disease, and
      diagnosis of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridium difficile and to examine
      therapies recommended by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.
      QUALITY OF EVIDENCE MEDLINE: was searched using MeSH headings. Controlled trials 
      for therapy were sought, but case-control studies and observational reviews were 
      included. MAIN MESSAGE: Clostridium difficile causes approximately 20% of cases
      of diarrhea associated with antibiotics, including clindamycin and the second-
      and third-generation cephalosporins. Diarrhea is usually mild, but can be severe;
      extreme cases develop toxic megacolon. Diagnosis is dependent on demonstrating
      presence of clostridial toxin in stool specimens or of pseudomembranes through
      sigmoidoscopy. First-line therapy for C. difficile diarrhea is restricted to
      metronidazole. Second-line therapy for treatment failure is vancomycin. For
      relapse, a second course of metronidazole is recommended; tapering courses of
      vancomycin and probiotics are used for multiple recurrences. CONCLUSION:
      Clostridium difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen requiring prudent use
      of antibiotics and strict infection-control policies to prevent large health care
      costs.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: dysfunction of GALT and gut bacterial flora (II).
PG  - 125-36
AB  - The precise cause(s) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown. From 
      animal models and human studies it is well established that gut bacterial flora
      are essential for inducing the bowel inflammation. Animal models, when kept in a 
      germ-free environment, do not develop colitis until the gut flora is
      reconstituted. It is not clear whether the bacterial antigens (Ags) from the
      normal flora or some other pathogenic bacterial Ags induce/propagate the
      inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite extensive
      research it has not been possible to identify any specific bacteria or virus as a
      credible cause of IBD. Recent understanding of quorum sensing molecules (QSMs)
      secreted by bacteria helps to explain the community behaviour in bacterial
      species. When QSMs reach a defined concentration, they activate bacterial
      proliferation and a number of virulence genes. Also, these molecules have been
      found to modulate the immune system to the advantage of the gut bacteria. They
      have not been well studied, however, in the gut. Inappropriate secretion of QSMs 
      may alter the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and, thereby, deregulate the 
      immune tolerance normally present. Usefulness of probiotics and their immune
      modulating effects are being increasingly reported. Probiotics are also being
      used in the treatment of IBD. The interaction between the epithelial cells and
      the gut flora is very important as this is the first line of contact; this
      interaction may determine the induction of tolerance and mucosal integrity or
      immune activity, tissue inflammation and abnormal permeability. The latter is
      documented in patients with IBD and their healthy relatives. This may be an
      important factor in disruption of mucosal integrity and GALT dysfunction.

TI  - Randomized placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk on active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1133-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are efficacious for treating and maintaining remission of 
      ulcerative colitis. AIM: To conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk supplementation as a dietary adjunct in treating
      active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate,
      active, ulcerative colitis randomly received 100 mL/day of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk or placebo for 12 weeks with conventional
      treatment. RESULTS: Clinical and endoscopic activity indices and histological
      scores were similar in the two groups before treatment. Although improvements
      were significant in both groups, the clinical activity index was significantly
      lower in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk than in the placebo group after
      treatment. The post-treatment endoscopic activity index and histological score
      were significantly reduced in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but not the
      placebo group. Increases in faecal butyrate, propionate and short-chain fatty
      acid concentrations were significant in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but
      not the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed in either group.
      CONCLUSION: Supplementation with this bifidobacteria-fermented milk product is
      safe and more effective than conventional treatment alone, suggesting possible
      beneficial effects in managing active ulcerative colitis. This is a pilot study
      and further larger studies are required to confirm the result these preliminary
      results.

TI  - Medical therapy for ulcerative colitis: the state of the art and beyond.
PG  - 488-95
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the large
      intestine. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of UC have
      led to the development of novel treatments for this often debilitating condition.
      Aside from aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, drugs that have been used for
      decades in the treatment of UC, biologic agents, in addition to medications
      targeting specific effector mechanisms involved in the inflammatory cascade, have
      been used in patients with UC with varying degrees of success. Clinicians have
      never had as many therapeutic options for UC as they do today. Herein we review
      the variety of treatment options, both standard and investigational, that are
      available for patients with UC.

TI  - Low-dose balsalazide plus a high-potency probiotic preparation is more effective 
      than balsalazide alone or mesalazine in the treatment of acute mild-to-moderate
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - PI126-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Balsalazide is well tolerated and effective in treating acute
      ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 is a probiotic cocktail proven to be effective in
      preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis. We compared the efficacy and safety of
      low-dose balsalazide (2.25 g/day) plus 3 g/day VLS#3 (group A) with medium-dose
      balsalazide alone (group B) and with mesalazine (group C) in the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: Ninety patients (30
      per group) were randomly enrolled, with a treatment duration of 8 weeks. Efficacy
      was assessed by symptoms assessment, endoscopic appearance, and histological
      evaluation. RESULTS: Balsalazide/VSL#3 was significantly superior to balsalazide 
      alone and to mesalazine in obtaining remission: 24 patients of group A were in
      remission [per-protocol: 85.71% (C.I.95%: 62-96), on intention-to-treat: 80%
      (C.I.95%: 59-91)], while 21 group B [per-protocol: 80.77% (C.I. 95%: 51-82), on
      intention-to-treat: 77% (C.I.95%: 43-81)] and 16 group C patients [per-protocol: 
      72.73% (C.I. 95%: 30-75), on intention-to-treat: 53.33% (C.I.95%: 42-62)] were in
      remission (p<0.02). Balsalazide with or without VSL#3 was better tolerated than
      mesalazine: two group C patients were withdrawn from the study because of severe 
      side-effects; 1 group A (3.33%), 3 group B (10%) and 4 group C (13.33%) patients 
      experienced slight side-effects. The balsalazide/VSL#3 combination was faster in 
      obtaining remission than balsalazide alone or mesalazine (4, 7.5, and 13 days in 
      groups A, B and C, respectively) and also better in improving all parameters
      evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Balsalazide/VSL#3 may be a very good choice in the
      treatment of active mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis instead of
      balsalazide alone or mesalazine.

TI  - Management of pouch dysfunction or pouchitis with an ileoanal pouch.
PG  - 993-1006
AB  - Pouchitis, a non-specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir, is the most
      frequent long-term complication after pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis.
      Incidence rates vary widely. The etiology is still unknown, but genetic
      susceptibility and fecal stasis with bacterial overgrowth seem to be important
      factors. A clinical diagnosis should be always confirmed by endoscopy and
      histology, and Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI), based on clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic appearance and histologic findings, represents an objective 
      and reproducible scoring system for pouchitis. The treatment of pouchitis is
      largely empiric given the few controlled studies available. Antibiotics,
      especially metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are the therapy of choice. Chronic
      pouchitis occurs in about 10-15% of patients; in these cases, further diagnostic 
      tests should be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses. Highly concentrated
      probiotics (VSL#3) have been shown to be effective in preventing the onset and
      relapse of pouchitis.

TI  - Probiotics and medical nutrition therapy.
PG  - 56-68
AB  - Probiotics have been defined by The Food Agricultural Organization/World Health
      Organization (FAO/WHO) as "live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." They have been used for
      centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of
      probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal
      recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of
      English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship 
      between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been
      reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include
      diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune
      function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive,
      hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary
      tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further
      investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these
      medical conditions.

TI  - Maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis with the probiotic Escherichia coli
      Nissle 1917 is as effective as with standard mesalazine.
PG  - 1617-23
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence exists for the pathogenic role of the enteric flora
      in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics contain living microorganisms which
      exert health effects on the host. We compared the efficacy in maintaining
      remission of the probiotic preparation Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and
      established therapy with mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: In total, 327 patients were recruited and assigned to a double
      blind, double dummy trial to receive either the probiotic drug 200 mg once daily 
      (n = 162) or mesalazine 500 mg three times daily (n = 165). The study lasted for 
      12 months and patients were assessed by clinical and endoscopic activity indices 
      (Rachmilewitz) as well as by histology. The primary aim of the study was to
      confirm equivalent efficacy of the two drugs in the prevention of relapses.
      RESULTS: The per protocol analysis revealed relapses in 40/110 (36.4%) patients
      in the E coli Nissle 1917 group and 38/112 (33.9%) in the mesalazine group
      (significant equivalence p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses showed no differences
      between the treatment groups in terms of duration and localisation of disease or 
      pretrial treatment. Safety profile and tolerability were very good for both
      groups and were not different. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic drug E coli Nissle 1917
      shows efficacy and safety in maintaining remission equivalent to the gold
      standard mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. The effectiveness of
      probiotic treatment further underlines the pathogenetic significance of the
      enteric flora.

TI  - Bacterial colonization and the development of intestinal defences.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - In humans, intestinal defences develop during gestation and, at full term, have
      the capacity to respond in an appropriate manner to infectious agents and foreign
      antigens. Before an active protective response can occur, however, the gut must
      first be exposed to colonizing bacteria. Colonization with diverse intestinal
      microbes is necessary for the development of important gut defenses such as the
      synthesis and secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A and the generation of a
      balanced T helper (Th) cell response. Insights into normal immune physiological
      development of the gut have been made by studying the germ-free animal and
      intestinal defenses. These studies have provided insights into the physiology of 
      immune responses. Two important immunological functions are the secretion of
      polymeric immunoglobulin A to protect the intestinal surface against harmful
      stimuli and inhibition of the systemic response to commensal bacteria and food
      proteins (eg, oral tolerance) to prevent chronic inflammation. Neither function
      exists in the germ-free state, but rapidly develops after conventionalization
      (colonization) of the germ-free animal. In the present review, the importance of 
      bacterial colonization on the appearance of normal mucosal immune function and to
      the clinical consequences of inadequate colonization to the development of
      disease will be discussed. For example, excessive Th2 activity can lead to atopy,
      whereas Th1 predominance is found in conditions such as Helicobacter pylori
      gastritis and Crohn's disease. With the eradication of infectious diseases in
      developed countries in the past three decades, the incidence of atopic and
      autoimmune diseases has increased. This epidemiological observation has been
      explained by the 'hygiene hypothesis', which suggests that a reduction in
      microbial burden by public health measures has contributed to an immunological
      imbalance in the intestine. A family of pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like 
      receptors) on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells mediates innate immune responses 
      to bacterial molecular patterns and, thereby, orchestrates acquired immunity. As 
      the role of bacterial communication within the gut (bacterial-epithelial
      cross-talk) is clarified, physicians should be able to modulate gut immune
      responses, for example, by the use of probiotics.

TI  - Probiotics and human health: a clinical perspective.
PG  - 516-26
AB  - There is unequivocal evidence that administration of probiotics could be
      effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea in children and the
      prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and nosocomial/community acquired
      diarrhoea. Encouraging evidence is also emerging for the effectiveness of
      probiotics in the prevention and management of pouchitis and paediatric atopic
      diseases, and the prevention of postoperative infections. There is also strong
      evidence that certain probiotic strains are able to enhance immune function,
      especially in subjects with less than adequate immune function such as the
      elderly. Efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of traveller's diarrhoea,
      sepsis associated with severe acute pancreatitis, and cancers, the management of 
      ulcerative colitis, and lowering of blood cholesterol remains unproven. In
      addition to firm evidence of efficacy (for a range of conditions), major gaps
      exist in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which probiotics modulate
      various physiological functions and the optimum dose, frequency, and duration of 
      treatment for different probiotic strains.

TI  - Potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of haemolytic
      uraemic syndrome in shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli infection.
PG  - 479-82
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause a wide
      spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic carriage through to haemorrhagic
      colitis and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome. There are no current therapeutic
      interventions available in clinical practice that can prevent the development of 
      haemolytic uraemic syndrome. A number of newly developed agents offer the
      potential for the treatment of STEC-associated disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Three
      different classes of agent designed to bind and inactivate shiga toxin have now
      been developed. Synthetic toxin binders, recombinant bacteria and monoclonal
      antibodies provide potentially potent agents that could prevent the development
      of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. These agents have been shown in animal models of 
      STEC disease to be effective. A recent clinical trial of one synthetic toxin
      binder showed no benefit in established haemolytic uraemic syndrome. More potent 
      toxin binders, however, have since been developed and await human clinical
      trials. It is likely to be important that these agents are administered early in 
      the course of disease in order to have maximum efficacy. Although rapid
      diagnostic techniques are available for the diagnosis of STEC disease, they still
      rely on stool culture. SUMMARY: Clinicians need to maintain a high level of
      suspicion of STEC disease as the diagnosis is often made on epidemiological and
      clinical grounds. This will allow potential cases to be identified early and
      treated appropriately.

TI  - Review article: antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - Treatment with antibiotics in inflammatory bowel disease has a long tradition and
      is widely used. The indications for antibiotic therapy are wide ranging, from
      specific situations such as abscesses or fistulae, to patients with severe
      disease (as an unspecific 'protective' measure), and to address the hypothesis
      that the enteric flora as a whole, or specific microorganisms such as
      mycobacteria, are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      best-studied single antibiotic compound is metronidazole. However, overall, the
      scientific basis for the use of antibiotics is limited, which may reflect a lack 
      of interest from sponsors within the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this weak
      evidence base, antibiotics are a globally established therapeutic tool in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Growing evidence from human and animal studies points
      towards a pivotal pathogenetic role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel 
      disease. In view of these experimental findings, clinical trials have been
      undertaken to elucidate the therapeutic effects of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease. Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms which confer
      health benefits to the host by improving the microbial balance of the indigenous 
      microflora. So far, of the many candidates, one specific strain (Escherichia coli
      Nissle 1917) and a mixture of eight different bacteria have demonstrated
      convincing therapeutic efficacy in controlled studies. Maintenance therapy in
      ulcerative colitis and prevention therapy, as well as the treatment of pouchitis,
      have emerged as areas in which probiotic therapy offers a valid therapeutic
      alternative to current treatments. Further investigations may detect additional
      clinically effective probiotics and other clinical indications.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 544-52
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is a complicated condition, including Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis, and indeterminate colitis, that affects 
      the intestine and several extraintestinal sites. There has been much debate
      regarding whether Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are distinct entities or
      if they exist along a continuum of the same disease process. In this article, the
      pathogenic mechanisms and clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease
      are reviewed, as well as treatment options. Because Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis are chronic diseases, they have an important economic effect
      on our healthcare system and the United States as a whole. Some newer and more
      expensive treatment options may provide overall cost savings in select patient
      populations because of decreased use of healthcare resources.

TI  - Live Lactobacillus rhamnosus [corrected] is essential for the inhibitory effect
      on tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced interleukin-8 expression.
PG  - 5308-14
AB  - The mechanism of the apparent anti-inflammatory action of probiotic organisms is 
      unclear. Lactobacillus reuteri is effective in inhibiting colitis in
      interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice. Nerve growth factor (NGF), in addition to 
      its activity on neuronal cell growth, has significant anti-inflammatory effects
      in several experimental systems in vitro and in vivo, including a model of
      colitis. Our experiments were designed to explore the mechanism of effect of L.
      reuteri in the human epithelial cell lines T84 and HT29 on cytokine and NGF
      synthesis and IL-8 response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
      Epithelial cells were cultured for various times with live and killed L. reuteri 
      and examined by reverse transcription-PCR for NGF, IL-10, and TNF-alpha-induced
      IL-8 expression. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate
      intracellular IL-8 and secreted product. Western blotting and confocal microscopy
      were used to determine the effects on IkappaB and NF-kappaB, respectively. Live
      but not heat-killed or gamma-irradiated L. reuteri upregulated NGF and dose
      dependently inhibited constitutive synthesis by T84 and HT29 cells of IL-8 and
      that induced by TNF-alpha in terms of mRNA and intracellular and secreted
      protein. Similarly, L. reuteri inhibited IL-8 synthesis induced by Salmonella
      enterica serovar Typhimurium. L. reuteri required preincubation and adherence for
      effect, inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB to the nuclei of HeLa cells, and
      prevented degradation of IkappaB. Neither cellular lysates nor media supernatants
      had any effect on TNF-alpha-induced IL-8. The conclusion is that L. reuteri has
      potent direct anti-inflammatory activity on human epithelial cells, which is
      likely to be related to the activity of ingested probiotics. L. reuteri also
      upregulates an unusual anti-inflammatory molecule, NGF, and inhibits NF-kappaB
      translocation to the nucleus.

TI  - Probiotics and the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 286-99
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of
      probiotics beyond simple barrier and antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic
      mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been
      elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial 
      pathogens for a limited number of receptors present on the surface epithelium;
      (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response of gut-associated
      lymphoid and epithelial cells; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of
      pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier function; and (5) induction of T cell
      apoptosis in the mucosal immune compartment. The unraveling of these mechanisms
      of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of
      clinical inflammatory bowel disease. Though level 1 evidence now supports the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of postoperative pouchitis, only
      levels 2 and 3 evidence is currently available in support of the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged during the
      course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar
      therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials are vital to
      investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use,
      single or multi-strain formulation, and the concomitant use of probiotics,
      synbiotics, or antibiotics.

TI  - Probiotics in relapsing and chronic diarrhea.
PG  - 515-7
AB  - Diarrhea is common in oncology patients; if it becomes chronic and relapsing, it 
      can be debilitating, hinder planned management, and be difficult to treat. The
      authors describe two patients, one with leukemia who developed recurrent
      Clostridium difficile colitis and another who developed chronic diarrhea after
      bone marrow transplantation. In both patients, administration of antibiotics was 
      suspected as the cause. In one patient, relapsing diarrhea resolved after
      probiotics were given with a 2-day course of metronidazole, and in the other
      patient, chronic diarrhea resolved after probiotics were given; resolution was
      maintained after the probiotics were stopped. Probiotics may offer a way to bring
      about resolution in antibiotic-associated chronic diarrhea.

AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that upon ingestion exert health benefits.
      The impact of probiotics on gut flora represents a new and interesting
      therapeutic approach in a number of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
      According to actual publications and guidelines of medical societies, the
      clinical relevance of probiotics can be described as follows: (a) In the case of 
      ulcerative colitis, available data demonstrate benefits of probiotic therapy. (b)
      The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect
      seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics
      is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before 
      probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome
      have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been
      encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and
      therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.

TI  - Bacteriotherapy using fecal flora: toying with human motions.
PG  - 475-83
AB  - The intestinal flora may play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Components of bowel flora such as Lactobacillus
      acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus have long been used empirically as
      therapeutic agents for GI disorders. More complex combinations of probiotics for 
      therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most
      elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire
      fecal flora. Fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a
      therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. This type of bacteriotherapy
      has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically
      against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort
      for patients with severe Clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent
      diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. Encouraging results have also
      been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation.
      The therapeutic use of fecal bacteriotherapy is reviewed here and possible
      mechanisms of action and potential applications explored. Published reports on
      fecal bacteriotherapy are few in number, and detail the results of small
      uncontrolled open studies and case reports. Nevertheless, given the promising
      clinical responses, formal research into fecal bacteriotherapy is now warranted.

TI  - Microflora in inflammatory bowel diseases: a pediatric perspective.
PG  - S91-3
AB  - Several lines of evidence link inflammatory bowel diseases to modifications of
      intestinal microflora. Epidemiologic and clinical data suggest a triggering role 
      for select agents in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease. Experimental
      evidence indicates that intestinal microorganisms are needed for developing
      intestinal inflammation in IL-10 knockout mice, and this is associated with an
      increased number of adherent clostridia and a decrease of lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria. It may be hypothesized that a host-agent-specific relationship
      leads to an abnormal immune response, which may be genetically driven in select
      inflammatory bowel diseases. However, different from adults, the pattern of
      intestinal microflora undergoes profound changes during the early stage of life, 
      contributing to the development of the immune system. A close relationship exists
      between microbiologic and immunologic imprinting. The microbiologic imprinting in
      neonates may be modified using bacterial probiotics that colonize the intestine, 
      modify the immune response, and decrease the risk for atopy. Probiotics may
      decrease the recurrences of inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary evidence of 
      intestinal antiinflammatory effects has been detected in children with cystic
      fibrosis. Overall these data provide the rationale to investigate the interaction
      between intestinal microflora and the local and general immune response in
      children with, or at risk for, inflammatory bowel diseases. This approach may be 
      a key for understanding the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation and may
      disclose novel strategies to educate better the immune system, particularly
      during its developmental stage.

TI  - Host-bacterial interactions in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 331-41
AB  - Large numbers of different bacterial species are resident in the lumen of the
      distal gastrointestinal tract. The normal intestinal host-microbial interactions 
      are not well understood, but the relationship is generally believed to be either 
      mutually beneficial or beneficial to one without disadvantage to the other.
      Animal model and clinical studies suggest that IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
      may develop in a susceptible individual when the normal host-bacterial
      relationship is dysregulated. In addition to rodent models, this article reviews 
      studies that have investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
      interactions between intestinal mucosal cells and the resident luminal bacteria
      in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. 
      Mechanisms by which the intestinal mucosa is able to avoid pro-inflammatory
      responses to commensal bacteria (and their products) but able to respond
      appropriately to luminal pathogens is currently an area of active investigation. 
      Such studies are beginning to provide important clues regarding possible
      alterations in the mucosa that lead to the development of pro-inflammatory
      responses to resident bacteria in patients with IBD. Approaches to alter the
      intestinal microflora for therapeutic purposes and their potential mechanisms of 
      action are also discussed.

TI  - The effect of probiotic treatment with Clostridium butyricum on enterohemorrhagic
      Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in mice.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 has been considered as an agent
      responsible for outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic
      syndrome. We examined the effect of the probiotic agent Clostridium butyricum
      MIYAIRI strain 588 on EHEC O157:H7 infections in vitro and in vivo using
      gnotobiotic mice. The growth of EHEC O157:H7 and the production of Shiga-like
      toxins in broth cultures were inhibited by co-incubation with C. butyricum. The
      antibacterial effects of butyric and lactic acid were demonstrated in a
      dose-dependent manner. In addition, the inhibitory effect of butyric acid on the 
      viability of EHEC was demonstrated not only at low pH, but also at neutral pH
      adjusted to 7.0. Flowcytometric analysis showed that pre-incubation of Caco-2
      cells with C. butyricum and E. coli K12 inhibited the adhesion of EHEC O157:H7.
      However, the effect of C. butyricum on adhesion of EHEC to Caco-2 cells was more 
      inhibitory than that of E. coli K12. Gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with EHEC
      O157:H7 died within 4-7 days after the infection. On the other hand, all
      gnotobiotic mice prophylactically pre-treated with C. butyricum survived exposure
      to EHEC O157:H7 and of the gnotobiotic mice therapeutically post-treated with C. 
      butyricum, 50% survived. Both counts of EHEC O157:H7 and the amounts of
      shiga-like toxins (Stx1 and Stx2) in fecal contents of gnotobiotic mice
      di-associated with EHEC O157:H7 and C. butyricum were less than those of
      gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with EHEC O157:H7. These results indicated that 
      the probiotic bacterium C. butyricum MIYAIRI strain 588 has preventive and
      therapeutic effects on EHEC O157:H7 infection in gnotobiotic mice.

TI  - Clostridium difficile pilot study: effects of probiotic supplementation on the
      incidence of C. difficile diarrhoea.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - Colonic infection with Clostridium difficile, leading to pseudomembranous
      colitis, is a common complication of antibiotic therapy, especially in elderly
      patients. It has been suggested that non-pathogenic probiotic bacteria might
      prevent the development and recurrence of C. difficile infection. This
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study examines the role of probiotic
      administration in the prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in
      elderly patients receiving antibiotic therapy. Consecutive patients (150)
      receiving antibiotic therapy were randomised to receive either a probiotic
      containing both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium or placebo for 20 days. Upon
      admission to hospital, bowel habit was recorded and a faecal sample taken. Trial 
      probiotic or placebo was taken within 72 h of prescription of antibiotics, and a 
      second stool sample was taken in the event of development of diarrhoea during
      hospitalisation or after discharge. Of the randomised patients, 138 completed the
      study, 69 with probiotics in conjunction with antibiotics and 69 with antibiotics
      alone. On the basis of development of diarrhoea, the incidence of samples
      positive for C. difficile-associated toxins was 2.9% in the probiotic group
      compared with 7.25% in the placebo-control group. When samples from all patients 
      were tested (rather than just those developing diarrhoea) 46% of probiotic
      patients were toxin-positive compared with 78% of the placebo group.

TI  - Therapeutic manipulation of the enteric microflora in inflammatory bowel
      diseases: antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics.
PG  - 1620-33
AB  - Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis are caused by overly
      aggressive immune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric
      bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinical and experimental
      studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial 
      species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease
      tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease
      luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of
      activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species
      (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined 
      probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill
      evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience
      suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and
      ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis,
      whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative
      colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable 
      promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled
      therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread
      clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of
      treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive agents.

TI  - Medical therapy for ulcerative colitis 2004.
PG  - 1582-92
AB  - There continue to be evolutionary changes in the management of ulcerative colitis
      despite the fact that, aside from a variety of aminosalicylate formulations, no
      new therapies have been approved over the past few decades. Nevertheless, debates
      continue regarding the optimization of treatment with aminosalicylates and the
      short- and long-term benefits of immunomodulation in ulcerative colitis. This
      article focuses on the most recent clinical studies pertaining to the management 
      of ulcerative colitis and explores both the advances and controversies pertaining
      to aminosalicylate therapy, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and the purine
      antimetabolites. Novel therapeutic approaches--including preliminary experience
      with biological therapies directed at tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines, 
      adhesion molecules, growth factors, and probiotics--will be reviewed. Recent data
      regarding potential chemoprevention in long-standing ulcerative colitis and
      management of postoperative complications and pouchitis will also be discussed.

TI  - The probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 for the treatment of collagenous
      colitis: first results of an open-label trial.
PG  - 365-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous colitis is clinically characterized by watery diarrhoea
      and can histologically be diagnosed by a thickening of the subepithelial collagen
      layer and an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. So far, the
      pathogenesis of collagenous colitis and the role of luminal factors remain
      unclear. METHODS: This clinical pilot investigation was conducted with an
      open-label design to monitor the clinical effects of EcN on stool frequency and
      stool consistency in 14 patients (11 female, 3male; age: 58.1 +/- 9.6 years). Due
      to the open-label protocol EcN was administered at different doses (1 - 6
      capsules/day containing 2.5 - 25 x 10 (9) viable bacteria each). Except for two
      patients who discontinued treatment, therapy duration was at least 4 weeks.
      RESULTS: The results indicate a marked clinical response to the oral
      administration of EcN with a reduction of the stool frequency > or = 50 % in 9/14
      (64 %) patients. Stool frequency clearly (p = 0.034) decreased from 7.6 +/-
      4.8/day to 3.7 +/- 5.8/day at the end of therapy (between 4 and 18 weeks).
      Moreover, stool consistency changed in 7/14 patients from watery or slimy to soft
      (6 pts) and normal (1 pt), respectively. CONCLUSION: With respect to the
      preliminary data from this trial, the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) 
      seems to be of therapeutic clinical benefit in collagenous colitis. This may be
      explained with the recently shown antagonistic effect of EcN against Yersinia
      species, since a relevant number of patients suffering from collagenous colitis
      showed positive titres of serum IgG and IgA antibodies against Yersinia species. 
      Further studies on the effects of EcN on mucosal collagen metabolism and
      long-term follow-up are warranted.

TI  - Effects of probiotic on intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1521-5
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of probiotic on intestinal mucosae of patients
      with ulcerative colitis (UC), and to evaluate the role of probiotic in preventing
      the relapse of UC. METHODS: Thirty patients received treatment with
      sulphasalazine (SASP) and glucocorticoid and then were randomly administered
      bifid triple viable capsule (BIFICO) (1.26 g/d), or an identical placebo (starch)
      for 8 wk. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture 2 wk before and after
      the randomized treatments. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically
      and histologically after 2 mo of treatment or in case of relapse of UC. p65 and
      IkappaB expressions were determined by Western blot analysis. DNA-binding
      activity of NF-kappaB in colonic nuclear extracts was detected by electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay (EMSA). mRNA expressions of cytokines were identified by
      semi-quantitative assay, reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Three patients (20%) in the BIFICO group had relapses during
      2-mo follow-up period, compared with 14 (93.3%) in placebo group (P<0.01). The
      concentration of fecal lactobacilli, bifidobacteria was significantly increased
      in BIFICO-treated group only (P<0.01). The expressions of NF-kappaB p65 and DNA
      binding activity of NF-kappaB were significantly attenuated in the treatment
      group than that in control (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory
      cytokines was elevated in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The
      probiotic could impede the activation of NF-kappaB, decrease the expressions of
      TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and elevate the expression of IL-10. These results suggest
      that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in
      preventing flare-ups of chronic UC. It may become a prophylactic drug to decrease
      the relapse of UC.

TI  - The diagnosis and treatment of pouchitis in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S44-50
AB  - The ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedure has become the preferred
      surgical option for most patients with ulcerative colitis who require surgical
      removal of the colorectum. The vast majority of patients with this new anatomy
      will either not develop pouchitis or develop a few discrete episodes of acute
      pouchitis. However approximately one fourth of patients will develop recurrent
      pouchitis, with 5% being categorized as chronic pouchitis requiring maintenance
      therapy or, on rare occasion, pouch excision. Factors that are associated with an
      increased risk of pouchitis include primary sclerosing cholangitis,
      extraintestinal manifestations, and nonsmokers. Controversy surrounds other risk 
      factors such as extent of colitis, backwash ileitis, preoperative pANCA levels,
      and carrying a specific allele for IL-1 receptor antagonist. The etiology of
      pouchitis is unknown, but theories range from genetic susceptibility, bacterial
      overgrowth, ischemia, and fecal stasis, to a recurrence of ulcerative colitis in 
      the pouch, a missed diagnosis of Crohn's disease, or possibly a novel third form 
      of inflammatory bowel disease. Some patients with symptoms of pouchitis will not 
      have inflammation of the pouch, but rather, irritable pouch syndrome. Thus,
      endoscopic investigation with biopsy is important for declaring whether a patient
      has pouchitis. Indeed, the more commonly used scores, such as the pouch disease
      activity index, incorporate both endoscopic and histologic criteria. Not
      surprisingly, treatment options for patients with pouchitis resemble that of
      regular inflammatory bowel disease, although there have only been a few
      controlled trials. Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy, with metronidazole
      and ciprofloxacin demonstrating benefit in controlled trials. Probiotics are
      effective for maintaining remission of pouchitis. Mesalamine, corticosteroids,
      and immunomodulators have been used with some success. Occasionally, patients
      with well-documented ulcerative colitis as the indication for IPAA will develop
      what appears to be Crohn's disease of the pouch, on the basis of granulomatous
      inflammation, pre-pouch ileitis, or fistulae. The treatment is similar to Crohn's
      disease, including the use of infliximab. Dysplasia within the pouch mucosa
      itself is quite rare. Reports of dysplasia occurring in patients with IPAA are
      usually due to neoplastic change within the residual cuff of rectal or transition
      zone mucosa just below the pouch, rather than in the ileal mucosa of the pouch.
      With further elucidation of the genetic basis for inflammatory bowel disease, we 
      should be able to more accurately classify patients with ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease genotypically. Hopefully, this will also bring more clarity to
      the heterogeneous population of patients with pouchitis and allow for more
      focused therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Lactobacillus GG in inducing and maintaining remission of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in
      chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
      colitis. Alteration of the intestinal microflora by antibiotic or probiotic
      therapy may induce and maintain remission. The aim of this randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effect of oral Lactobacillus GG (L.
      GG) to induce or maintain medically induced remission. METHODS: Eleven patients
      with moderate to active Crohn's disease were enrolled in this trial to receive
      either L. GG (2 x 10(9) CFU/day) or placebo for six months. All patients were
      started on a tapering steroid regime and received antibiotics for the week before
      the probiotic/placebo medication was initiated. The primary end point was
      sustained remission, defined as freedom from relapse at the 6 months follow-up
      visit. Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI of >100 points. RESULTS: 5/11
      patients finished the study, with 2 patients in each group in sustained
      remission. The median time to relapse was 16 +/- 4 weeks in the L. GG group and
      12 +/- 4.3 weeks in the placebo group (p = 0.5). CONCLUSION: In this study we
      could not demonstrate a benefit of L. GG in inducing or maintaining medically
      induced remission in CD.

TI  - Delay of the first onset of pouchitis by oral intake of the probiotic strain
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
PG  - 876-84
AB  - PURPOSE: Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of
      choice for patients with refractory or fulminant ulcerative colitis. The most
      common long-term complication in these patients is pouchitis. This study was
      designed to investigate the efficacy of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in
      long-term delaying the first onset of pouchitis. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2001, 
      a consecutive series of 127 patients presenting with ulcerative colitis underwent
      an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam.
      Histopathologic investigation of the resected specimens revealed unsuspected
      Crohn's disease in five patients. Postoperative complications resulted in pouch
      excision in five patients. The remaining 117 patients were included in this
      study. All episodes of pouchitis occurring in this group were analyzed. Pouchitis
      was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic
      features. The 39 patients, who underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 
      1996 and 2001, started immediately after the operation with the daily intake of
      L. rhamnosus GG in a fermented product. The 78 patients, in whom an ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis was performed between 1989 and 1996, received no L.
      rhamnosus GG. RESULTS: Except for the duration of follow-up, the patient
      characteristics, indications for proctocolectomy, number of postoperative
      complications, and functional outcome were similar in both groups. First episodes
      of pouchitis were observed less frequently in patients with a daily intake of L. 
      rhamnosus GG (cumulative risk at 3 years: 7 vs. 29 percent; P = 0.011).
      CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of fermented products containing L. rhamnosus GG
      provides significant clinical benefit, without side effects. Based on the results
      of this study, we recommend a daily intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (dose
      1-2 x 10(10) bacteria) to delay the first onset of pouchitis.

TI  - Drug treatment of ulcerative colitis: unfractionated heparin, low molecular
      weight heparins and beyond.
PG  - 329-34
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterised by chronic inflammation of the colon of 
      unknown aetiology. Medical treatment of UC is complex and sometimes
      unsatisfactory. A total of 75% of patients experience relapses during the course 
      of their illness and 20 - 25% require a colostomy. Recent years have witnessed a 
      paradigm shift in the way UC is medically treated. The focus has now shifted to
      newer forms of therapy along with the older established drugs such as
      sulfasalazine and corticosteroids. Unfractionated heparin and low molecular
      weight heparins have been tested for their efficacy in patients with UC with
      conflicting results in various studies. Immunosuppressive and immune-based
      therapies, drugs modifying biological responses, prebiotics, probiotics,
      symbiotics, melatonin and topical butyrate have all been tested with variable
      success. The current review delineates the recent therapeutic alternatives in UC 
      with main emphasis on heparins.

TI  - Probiotics in gastroenterology: indications and future perspectives.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the
      intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several
      gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been
      disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated
      with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii.
      Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits
      have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea.
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized 
      by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which
      probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and 
      Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce
      relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses
      has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies
      probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for
      probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are
      inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption.
      Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of
      colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this
      disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been
      reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled
      studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use
      can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and
      duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available
      probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be
      elucidated.

TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum 299: beneficial in vitro immunomodulation in cells
      extracted from inflamed human colon.
PG  - 166-73
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study determined the pattern of cytokine
      secretion (interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interferon 
      [IFN]-gamma and IL-10) and their cellular sources in mononuclear cells isolated
      from colonic mucosa from normal and ulcerative colitis (UC) in response to
      probiotic and pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were extracted from
      normal and active UC colonic mucosa and incubated with pure sonicates of
      probiotic, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. Cytokine secretion was measured in
      culture supernatant and intracellular cytokine staining measured using
      fluorescent-activated cytometry. RESULTS: In mononuclear cells isolated from
      normal mucosa, significant increases in mean IL-1beta were observed with
      enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (286.3 +/- 138.7 pg/mL P < 0.05) and E. coli
      (440.5 +/- 194.0 pg/mL P < 0.01) compared with unstimulated control cells (16.7
      +/- 4.8 pg/mL). In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated from active UC mucosa
      produced significant increases in mean IL-1beta in response to stimulation with
      Salmonella dublin (230.5 +/- 38.8 pg/mL P < 0.05), enteropathogenic E. coli
      (231.7 +/- 45.3 pg/mL P < 0.05) and E. coli (465.4 +/- 60.2 pg/mL P < 0.001)
      compared with unstimulated control cells (60.7 +/- 17.1 pg/mL). Escherichia coli 
      also produced significant mean increases of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma compared with
      unstimulated control cells. No significant increases in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or
      IFN-gamma were observed with Lactobacillus plantarum in cells derived from normal
      or inflamed mucosa. Strikingly, incubation of L. plantarum with mononuclear cells
      isolated from active UC mucosa resulted in significant increases of mean IL-10
      (327 +/- 53.5 pg/mL, P < 0.05) compared with unstimulated control cells (29.7 +/-
      13.2 pg/mL). Intracellular cytokine staining confirmed T-cell and macrophage
      IL-10 production after L. plantarum stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus
      plantarum demonstrates beneficial immunomodulatory activity by increasing IL-10
      synthesis and secretion in macrophages and T-cells derived from the inflamed
      colon. This may provide a mechanism through which probiotic bacteria ameliorate
      inappropriate inflammation and induce tolerance.

TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic studies of murine intestinal lactobacilli: species
      differences in mice with and without colitis.
PG  - 558-68
AB  - Lactobacilli represent components of the commensal mammalian gastrointestinal
      microbiota and are useful as probiotics, functional foods, and dairy products.
      This study includes systematic polyphasic analyses of murine intestinal
      Lactobacillus isolates and correlation of taxonomic findings with data from
      cytokine production assays. Lactobacilli were recovered from mice with
      microbiota-dependent colitis (interleukin-10 [IL-10]-deficient C57BL/6 mice) and 
      from mice without colitis (Swiss Webster and inducible nitric oxide
      synthetase-deficient C57BL/6 mice). Polyphasic analyses were performed to
      elucidate taxonomic relationships among 88 reference and murine gastrointestinal 
      lactobacilli. Genotypic tests included single-locus analyses (16S ribosomal DNA
      sequencing and 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region PCR) and genomic DNA
      profiling (repetitive DNA element-based PCR), and phenotypic analyses encompassed
      more than 50 tests for carbohydrate utilization, enzyme production, and
      antimicrobial resistance. From 20 mice without colitis, six Lactobacillus species
      were recovered; the majority of the mice were colonized with L. reuteri or L.
      murinus (72% of isolates). In contrast, only, L. johnsonii was isolated from 14
      IL-10-deficient mice. Using an in vitro assay, we screened murine isolates for
      their ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion by
      lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Interestingly, a subpopulation of
      lactobacilli recovered from mice without colitis displayed TNF-alpha inhibitory
      properties, whereas none of the L. johnsonii isolates from IL-10-deficient mice
      exhibited this effect. We propose that differences among intestinal Lactobacillus
      populations in mammals, combined with host genetic susceptibilities, may account 
      partly for variations in host mucosal responses.

PG  - 37-53
AB  - Ulcerative colitis presents in childhood in 10% of those affected, usually with
      pancolitis. Important features in management include growth, development and
      avoidance of treatment toxicity. This review addresses the current treatment
      options including both the paediatric evidence-based experience and areas where
      paediatric practice is informed by adult studies. Standard treatments include
      sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, purine derivatives
      (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) and surgery. Other immunosuppressant therapies
      and the emerging roles for biological therapies and probiotics are discussed.

TI  - Rationale for probiotic and antibiotic treatment strategies in inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 105-28
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis are chronic aggressive disorders which share many similarities
      concerning pathomechanism and clinical course, but have very distinct features.
      Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations,
      such as the terminal ileum and cecum in Crohn's disease and the rectum in
      ulcerative colitis. In recent years, overwhelming evidence accumulated,
      supporting the hypothesis that IBD are characterized by a genetically determined,
      overly aggressive immune response towards ubiquitous luminal antigens, especially
      commensal bacteria and their products. Trials in both human IBD and experimental 
      colitis have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics may influence the
      course of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and antibiotics with narrow
      activity against the anaerobic fraction of the flora can prevent relapse in
      Crohn's disease after surgically induced remission. Since relevant antibiotic
      strategies can be associated with some side effects, the ongoing research
      recently focused on alternative methods to modify the intestinal flora in
      patients with IBD. Clinical observations including few controlled trials, basic
      research, and animal studies have suggested a potential role for probiotic
      bacteria within the treatment regimens for IBD. However, the mode of action of
      these organisms is still largely unclear and in vitro studies are inconclusive.
      This review summarizes recent in vitro and in vivo data regarding the role of the
      intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and 
      possible therapeutic mechanisms of probiotic bacteria relevant to IBD.
      Furthermore, we will review clinical trials examining the efficacy of antibiotic 
      and probiotic treatment strategies in IBD.

AB  - Biological therapies in inflammatory bowel disease reflect the exponential
      advancement in understanding the human intestinal immune system and particularly 
      the biology of intestinal inflammation during the past decade. The better
      understanding of the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease has evolved from
      desriptive clinical data and genetically engineered animal models. It led to
      great interest in the evaluation of a variety of new therapeutic agents with
      novel actions. This review will discuss the mechanisms of biologicals (antibodies
      against pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell antibodies, anti-inflammtory
      cytokines, adhesion molecule blockers, growth factors, hormones, colony
      stimulating factors, fusion proteins, anti-sense oligonucleotides, trefoil
      peptides, immunostimulatory [ISS] DNA) used in the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease and summarizes the available data on established biologic therapies
      as well as investigational agents and briefly touch on probiotics. Based on the
      data discussed, it seems that biologicals will play an important role in managing
      inflammatory bowel disease in the near future.

PG  - 821-31
AB  - Probiotics are living micro-organisms that belong to the normal enteric flora and
      exert a beneficial effect on health and well-being. The rationale for the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in pouchitis (the most frequent long-term
      complication following pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis) and postoperative
      recurrence in Crohn's disease is based on convincing evidence suggesting a
      crucial role for the endogenous intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of
      these conditions. Positive results have been obtained with the administration of 
      highly concentrated probiotic preparations in preventing the onset and relapses
      of pouchitis. Further controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of 
      probiotics in the prophylaxis of postoperative recurrences of Crohn's disease and
      in the treatment of mild pouchitis.

TI  - Probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: a critical review.
PG  - 805-20
AB  - Intestinal bacteria play a key role in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics
      attempt to modify disease by favourably altering bacterial composition, immune
      status, and inflammation. Until recently, probiotic therapy was considered 'folk'
      medicine, but there now is emerging interest on the part of the general public
      and scientific communities in the use of probiotics in human disease. This
      practical, evidence-based review examines probiotics as therapy for inflammatory 
      bowel disease in humans. There are very few such published randomized clinical
      trials, but some data exist that possibly show an efficacy of probiotics as
      maintenance therapy in chronic relapsing pouchitis. Obstacles to providing
      probiotic therapy include selection of appropriate strains, poorly regulated
      probiotic quality standardization, processing and human biologic factors which
      impair probiotic viability, difficulty in maintaining new bacterial populations
      in the gut, and local product unavailability. Studies have focused on specific
      inflammatory bowel disease subgroups, limiting general applicability for the
      practitioner. Basic research highlights the importance of bacteria in these
      conditions, and the possibility that probiotics will modify physiological
      parameters. Well-designed, randomized clinical studies are still required to
      define the role of probiotics as therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Role of bacteria in experimental colitis.
PG  - 793-804
AB  - Epidemiology suggests some relationship between the establishment of the gut
      flora and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease. Unrestrained
      activation of the immune system against commensal bacteria appears to be
      responsible for the chronicity of these diseases. In animal models,
      broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the bacterial load and militate against
      intestinal inflammation. Several bacterial species found in of the common
      microflora, including anaerobes, are able to invade the colonic wall when there
      is dysfunction of the colonic mucosal barrier. Most aerobes provoke focal areas
      of acute inflammation, but some anaerobes in the predominant flora induce diffuse
      a fibrogenic transmural response. Current research aims to identify the
      probiotics that might act against these bacteria. Colonization with specific
      probiotic strains, including a bacterium genetically engineered to secrete
      interleukin-10, prevents spontaneous colitis in susceptible mice. Certain
      lactobacilli exhibit anti-inflammatory properties naturally, i.e. without
      previous genetic manipulation. Prebiotics may increase colonization by
      lactobacilli and can prevent mucosal inflammation. Modulation of the gut flora
      with probiotics may prove useful in the prevention and control of inflammatory
      bowel diseases.

      effect of different medicines (vitamins B1, B6 and C, prebiotic inulin,
      probiotics Bifidumbacterin and Enterol) on the persistence factors of C.
      difficile and microbial resistance to vancomycin, thienam, lincomycin,
      clindamycin was evaluated. The anti-lysozyme and anti-complement activity of C.
      difficile was found to decrease under the influence of vitamins B1, B6, C,
      inulin, exometabolites of bifidobacteria. Under the impact of the preparations
      used in this study changes in the sensitivity of C. difficile to antibiotics of
      the lincoamide, carbapenem, glycopeptide groups were found to occur. The data
      obtained reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of the
      medicines under study on the intestinal microbiocenosis in patients with
      antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  - Review article: colitis-associated cancer -- time for new strategies.
PG  - 6-9
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a feared and potentially life-threatening
      complication of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis. Currently, the main 
      preventive strategy is a secondary one, i.e. surveillance colonoscopy usually
      after 8 years of disease duration, when the risk for neoplasia begins to
      increase. Despite its widespread acceptance, dysplasia and cancer surveillance is
      unproven in terms of reducing mortality or morbidity and there is a remarkable
      lack of uniformity in the manner in which it is practised. In this review
      article, the pitfalls of dysplasia surveillance are summarized and the need for
      novel chemopreventive and perhaps pharmabiotic approaches for prevention are
      highlighted.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease Part 1: ulcerative colitis--pathophysiology and
      conventional and alternative treatment options.
PG  - 247-83
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC), a subcategory of inflammatory bowel disease, afflicts
      1-2 million people in the United States, and many more worldwide. Although the
      exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains undetermined, the condition appears to 
      be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While
      conventional treatments can be effective in maintaining remission and decreasing 
      the length of active disease periods, the treatments are not without side
      effects, and a significant number of people suffering from UC fail to respond to 
      even the strongest drugs. This article reviews potential unconventional
      treatments - transdermal nicotine, heparin, melatonin, DHEA, probiotics, fiber,
      dietary changes, botanicals, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients - that
      may be considered in conjunction with conventional approaches or as part of a
      comprehensive alternative treatment protocol. In addition this review addresses
      risk factors, pathogenesis, nutrient deficiencies, conventional treatment
      approaches, and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease.

TI  - [Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. A review based on current evidence].
PG  - 55-61
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is
      multifactorial. Recent investigations have associated episodes of infectious
      gastroenteritis with development of IBS. This condition is named post-infectious 
      IBS (PI-IBS). The role of inflammation-infection in IBS pathogenesis is not well 
      understood. AIM: To review published scientific evidence on PI-IBS regarding risk
      factors, causal agents, histopathological changes, and treatment. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: An electronic search in MEDLINE and abstracts presented at national and 
      international GI meetings was performed, looking for information published in the
      past 50 years including animal studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, and
      series of cases and case reports, using the key words post-infectious enteritis, 
      post-dysenteric or post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), and
      post-infectious colitis. RESULTS: Fifty one papers were included. These studies
      were classified according to pathophysiologic mechanisms, infectious agents
      involved, animal or human studies, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence
      shows a strong association between colonic infection and inflammation with
      development of IBS. Approximately 25% of patients with IBS have a history of
      infectious enteritis. Microbial agents related with PI-IBS include bacteria
      (Campylobacter, Salmonella) and parasites (Trichinella spiralis). Increased
      number of enteroendocrine cells, CD3 lymphocytes and mast cells within the
      colonic muscle wall, release of pro-inflammatory substances, and increased number
      of inflammatory cells with intestinal nervous endings are the most common
      histopathologic findings. Patients developing PI-IBS have a higher frequency of
      psychological disorders and stressful events prior to the gastroenteritis
      episode. Therapeutic interventions with steroids, COX-2 inhibitors, antibiotics
      and probiotics require further investigation.

TI  - Probiotic lactobacilli: a new perspective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1973-80
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      results from an interaction between susceptibility genes, the host's bacterial
      environment, gut barrier defects, and immunological factors. New management
      approaches have been evolved from advances in our understanding of the
      pathobiology of this common gut disorder In particular, the therapeutic
      manipulation of the bacterial microenvironment in the gut seems to offer an
      innovative tool for the treatment of those patients. Since the gut is a highly
      sensitizing organ that contributes to the systemic immune response, potent
      treatments need to be developed to reduce gut inflammation in this disorder.
      Recent studies have demonstrated that probiotic lactobacilli, and also
      immunostimulatory DNA sequences from those same bacteria have an important
      anti-inflammatory potential in this context. Future research should better define
      among patients with inflammatory bowel disease the various clinical phenotypes
      with the greatest potential of response to probiotic treatment. Identification of
      the genes leading to the disease and a rather better understanding of the
      underlying immunoregulatory abnormalities will be crucial steps to define the
      different profiles of interaction between endogenous digestive bacterial flora
      and the immune system in each individual patient. Such advances will probably
      lead to targeting of effective treatments, including bacteriotherapy with
      probiotic lactobacilli, to subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Intestinal flora and Crohn's disease].
PG  - 276-81
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) proceeds through stages of 
      initiation, amplification and healing. Abundant clinical and experimental data
      incriminate luminal bacteria or bacterial products in both the initiation and
      perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation. Macrophage and T-cell activation
      with accompanying inflammatory cytokine production appears to be an early event. 
      Studies of lymphocyte responsiveness to autologous and heterologous intestinal
      bacteria have suggested that this activation may result from a breakdown in
      tolerance to the enteric flora in IBD. This lack of tolerance might be due to an 
      imbalance between protective and aggressive commensal luminal bacterial species
      (dysbiosis), a decreased barrier function and/or an impaired mucosal clearance
      allowing the access of bacteria to the mucosal immune system and lack of
      regulatory mediators or cells. There is still controversy over whether the
      virulence traits of bacteria are expressed broadly or just in a small subset of
      bacteria. Individual bacterial species within the indigenous flora vary in their 
      capacity to drive intestinal inflammation. In experimental models, some bacteria 
      such as Bacteroides vulgatus can cause colitis alone when monoassociated in the
      HLA-B27 transgenic rat model. Others, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
      species have no proinflammatory capacity and have been used as probiotics. In
      patients with IBD, systematic approach to this issue is hampered by the limited
      knowledge of intestinal flora. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli are a possible 
      candidate for the onset and/or persistence of intestinal inflammation in patients
      with Crohn's disease, since they possess all the virulence factors that allow the
      bacteria to cross the intestinal barrier, to move to deep tissues, and to
      continuously activate macrophages. The recent identification of NOD2/CARD15 as a 
      susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease has provided another link between the
      immune response to enteric bacteria and the development of mucosal inflammation. 
      NOD2/CARD15 is composed of two caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a
      nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a leucin-rich-repeat (LRR) region. The LRR
      domain of NOD2/CARD15 has binding activity for bacterial peptidoglycans and its
      deletion stimulates the NF-kappaB pathway. The most frequent variants of
      NOD2/CARD15 observed in Crohn's disease tend to cluster in the LRR and its
      adjacent regions. This suggests that the LRR domain of CD-associated variants is 
      likely to be impaired in its recognition of microbial components. Continuing
      studies are investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by
      NOD2/CARD15 variants in the intestinal mucosa.

TI  - A pilot trial of Saccharomyces boulardii in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 697-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Probiotics can be useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease. In a previous report, the non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii
      was found to be beneficial in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease. The
      aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of S. boulardii in ulcerative
      colitis patients. METHODS: A group of 25 patients with a mild to moderate
      clinical flare-up of ulcerative colitis received additional treatment with S.
      boulardii 250 mg three times a day for 4 weeks during maintenance treatment with 
      mesalazine. These patients were unsuitable for steroid therapy. Before and after 
      treatment, Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index was calculated. The probiotic
      treatment was considered a therapeutic success only when the final score was
      lower than 6. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients who completed the study, 17 attained
      clinical remission; this was confirmed endoscopically. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      preliminary results suggest that S. boulardii can be effective in the treatment
      of ulcerative colitis. Controlled studies with this probiotic agent are
      warranted.

TI  - Crohn's disease: a defensin deficiency syndrome?
PG  - 627-34
AB  - This comprehensive review promotes the novel concept that a defensin deficiency, 
      i.e. lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics, may play a pivotal role in the
      aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Such an impaired function of this chemical 
      barrier is consistent with the epidemiological relationship of good domestic
      hygiene with the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. The disregulated
      adaptive immune system, formerly believed to be the major cause in the
      development of Crohn's disease, may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal
      defence since the immune response is mostly directed against lumenal bacteria.
      Recent work has identified five different defensins expressed in colonic mucosa. 
      In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is characterised by an
      impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. This deficient induction may 
      be due to changes in the intracellular transcription by NFkappaB and the
      intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2, mutated in Crohn's disease. These
      findings are consistent with the mucosal attachment of lumenal bacteria in
      inflammatory bowel diseases and the frequent occurrence of other infectious
      agents. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also
      consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain
      inflammatory bowel disease states.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis using fecal bacteriotherapy.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the etiology of idiopathic ulcerative colitis (UC) remains
      poorly understood, the intestinal flora is suspected to play an important role.
      Specific, consistent abnormalities in flora composition peculiar to UC have not
      yet been described, however Clostridium difficile colitis has been cured by the
      infusion of human fecal flora into the colon. This approach may also be
      applicable to the treatment of UC on the basis of restoration of flora
      imbalances. GOAL: To observe the clinical, colonoscopic and histologic effects of
      human probiotic infusions (HPI) in 6 selected patients with UC. CASE REPORTS: Six
      patients (3 men and 3 women aged 25-53 years) with UC for less than 5 years were 
      treated with HPI. All patients had suffered severe, recurrent symptoms and UC had
      been confirmed on colonoscopy and histology. Fecal flora donors were healthy
      adults who were extensively screened for parasites and bacterial pathogens.
      Patients were prepared with antibiotics and oral polyethylene glycol lavage.
      Fecal suspensions were administered as retention enemas within 10 minutes of
      preparation and the process repeated daily for 5 days. By 1 week post-HPI some
      symptoms of UC had improved. Complete reversal of symptoms was achieved in all
      patients by 4 months post-HPI, by which time all other UC medications had been
      ceased. At 1 to 13 years post-HPI and without any UC medication, there was no
      clinical, colonoscopic, or histologic evidence of UC in any patient. CONCLUSIONS:
      Colonic infusion of donor human intestinal flora can reverse UC in selected
      patients. These anecdotal results support the concept of abnormal bowel flora or 
      even a specific, albeit unidentified, bacterial pathogen causing UC.

TI  - Biological containment of genetically modified Lactococcus lactis for intestinal 
      delivery of human interleukin 10.
PG  - 785-9
AB  - Genetically modified Lactococcus lactis secreting interleukin 10 provides a
      therapeutic approach for inflammatory bowel disease. However, the release of such
      genetically modified organisms through clinical use raises safety concerns. In an
      effort to address this problem, we replaced the thymidylate synthase gene thyA of
      L. lactis with a synthetic human IL10 gene. This thyA- hIL10+ L. lactis strain
      produced human IL-10 (hIL-10), and when deprived of thymidine or thymine, its
      viability dropped by several orders of magnitude, essentially preventing its
      accumulation in the environment. The biological containment system and the
      bacterium's capacity to secrete hIL-10 were validated in vivo in pigs. Our
      approach is a promising one for transgene containment because, in the unlikely
      event that the engineered L. lactis strain acquired an intact thyA gene from a
      donor such as L. lactis subsp. cremoris, the transgene would be eliminated from
      the genome.

TI  - Immunomodulatory consequences of oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      strain GG in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the
      treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. Although
      the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are
      largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. The objective of this
      study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus subspecies GG (Lb. GG) on the cellular immune response to intestinal
      microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood cells (PB) were
      stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and
      isolated Bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (Bfg) or Escherichia coli (Esch.
      coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma,
      TNF-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. CD4+ T-lymphocyte activation
      was determined by measurement of intracellular ATP following lysis of the cells. 
      The activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes towards isolated and
      heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic
      treatment. Additionally, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and in part IFN-gamma cytokine secretion
      by PB cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single
      members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the IL-10 and in part
      IL-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. In contrast, the
      activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole
      'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both 
      responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. This study 
      documents a direct effect by Lb. GG on the cellular immune system of healthy
      volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation
      due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.

TI  - Probiotics: a perspective on problems and pitfalls.
PG  - 34-6
AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut flora with probiotics promises to be a useful
      strategy for several disorders, including infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic
      conditions. However, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the normal flora
      and of the optimal use of probiotic products. At present, there is no reliable in
      vitro predictor of in vivo efficacy of putative probiotics. Indeed, probiotic
      performance should be defined in the context of the disease indication for which 
      it is intended. This will require rigorous prospective clinical trials. In
      addition, guidelines for routine clinical use of probiotics are confounded by
      insufficient data on optimum strain selection, dose, delivery vehicle and
      monitoring. Before the promise can be fulfilled, problems and potential pitfalls 
      with probiotic therapy need resolution.

TI  - Modern therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 30-3
AB  - Modern therapy for inflammatory bowel disease implies that therapy should be
      disease modifying rather than merely symptomatic. To achieve this goal, induction
      and maintenance of bowel healing are mandatory. Long-term bowel healing results
      in fewer hospitalizations and less surgery. Only immunosuppression therapy and
      biological approaches, or a combination of both, result in long-term healing of
      the bowel mucosa. Unsolved issues are when these drugs should be initiated and
      whether we should aim at eradicating the bowel inflammation from the onset of
      therapeutic intervention immediately following diagnosis. Identification of
      genetic and serologic parameters which allow prediction of the course of the
      disease would be useful for identifying patients who need aggressive treatment
      early in the disease. Once total control of the disease is achieved, long-term
      maintenance of a healed bowel is important. We hypothesize that changing the gut 
      flora, e.g. using probiotics, may allow maintenance of bowel healing after
      induction with biologicals and immunosuppression.

TI  - Intestinal flora and mucosal immune responses.
PG  - 77-86
AB  - The normal intestinal flora and the mucosal immune system exist in close spatial 
      proximity. A normal structure and function of both very complex systems is
      required for health and develops in a constant and interactive process. An
      abnormal host response to the normal intestinal flora leads to chronic intestinal
      inflammation. Probiotic bacteria may modulate the intestinal flora and the
      mucosal immune response and are an effective therapy for remission maintenance of
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis.

TI  - Assessment of mucosal inflammation and circulation in response to probiotics in
      patients operated with ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition, and a disturbed
      microbiological flora and mucosal blood flow in the pouch have been suggested as 
      possible causes. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has been used successfully to
      measure gastric and colonic mucosal perfusion in humans. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the effect of intervention with probiotics on ileal pouch
      inflammation and perfusion in the pouch, assessed by endoscopy, histology, fecal 
      calprotectin and LDF. METHODS: A fermented milk product (Cultura; 500 ml)
      containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteria (Bb-12) was given daily
      for 4 weeks to 10 patients operated with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Mucosal perfusion was measured with LDF and the degree
      of inflammation was examined at predefined levels of the distal bowel by
      endoscopy and histology. Stool samples were cultured for lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria and calprotectin were measured before and after intervention.
      RESULTS: The LDF measurements were reproducible in the pelvic pouch at each of
      the predefined levels, but did not change after intervention. The mucosal
      perfusion was reduced in the distal compared to the proximal part of the pouch.
      Calprotectin levels did not change significantly after intervention. The median
      endoscopic score for inflammation was significantly reduced by 50% after
      intervention, whereas the histological score did not change significantly.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that probiotics primarily act superficially, with
      change of gross appearance of the mucosa at endoscopy, but without significant
      effect on histological picture, mucosal perfusion or faecal calprotectin, during 
      a relatively short period of 4 weeks.

TI  - Prophylaxis of pouchitis onset with probiotic therapy: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1202-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have recently documented the efficacy of a highly
      concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3) in the prevention of flare-up in
      patients with chronic pouchitis. The aim of this study was to compare probiotic
      therapy with VSL#3 versus placebo in the ability to prevent the onset of acute
      pouchitis during the first year after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. METHODS:
      Forty consecutive patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for
      ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive either VSL#3 (1 packet containing
      900 billion bacteria/day) (n = 20) or an identical placebo (n = 20) immediately
      after ileostomy closure for 1 year. The patients were assessed clinically,
      endoscopically, and histologically after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
      Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      Questionnaire. RESULTS: Two of the 20 patients (10%) treated with VSL#3 had an
      episode of acute pouchitis compared with 8 of the 20 patients (40%) treated with 
      placebo (log-rank test, z = 2.273; P < 0.05). Treatment with VSL#3 determined a
      significant improvement in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score,
      whereas this was not the case with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VSL#3 is 
      effective in the prevention of the onset of acute pouchitis and improves quality 
      of life of patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.

TI  - Intestinal bacteria and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 9-20
AB  - Convincing evidence from both animal models and the study of patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates the intestinal microflora in the initiation
      and maintenance of the inflammatory processes in this condition. Despite this, no
      specific pathogen has been identified as causal and the disease is widely
      believed to occur as the result of a genetically determined, but abnormal immune 
      response to commensal bacteria. When compared with healthy people, UC patients
      have increased levels of mucosal IgG directed against the normal microflora.
      Studies of mucosal bacterial populations in UC indicate that there may be
      increased numbers of organisms, but reduced counts of "protective" bacteria such 
      as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. In animal models of colitis, antibiotics,
      particularly metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and the combination of
      vancomycin/impinemem protect against UC, especially if given before the onset of 
      inflammation. These antibiotics target anaerobes and some Gram-positive organisms
      such as enterococci. However, antibiotic use in more than a dozen randomised
      control trials has been very disappointing, probably because we do not know which
      species to target, when to give the antibiotics, for how long and in what
      combinations. Surprisingly, therefore, there is a consistent benefit in the small
      number of studies reported of probiotics to manage UC and pouchitis. There is
      scope for more work in this area focussing on the mucosal microflora, its
      interactions with the gut immune system, its metabolic properties and the
      potential ways of modifying it.

TI  - Nondigestible oligosaccharides enhance bacterial colonization resistance against 
      Clostridium difficile in vitro.
PG  - 1920-7
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the principal etiologic agent of pseudomembranous
      colitis and is a major cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea. A
      limited degree of success in controlling C. difficile infection has been achieved
      by using probiotics; however, prebiotics can also be used to change bacterial
      community structure and metabolism in the large gut, although the effects of
      these carbohydrates on suppression of clostridial pathogens have not been well
      characterized. The aims of this study were to investigate the bifidogenicity of
      three nondigestible oligosaccharide (NDO) preparations in normal and
      antibiotic-treated fecal microbiotas in vitro and their abilities to increase
      barrier resistance against colonization by C. difficile by using cultural and
      molecular techniques. Fecal cultures from three healthy volunteers were
      challenged with a toxigenic strain of C. difficile, and molecular probes were
      used to monitor growth of the pathogen, together with growth of bifidobacterial
      and bacteroides populations, over a time course. Evidence of colonization
      resistance was assessed by determining viable bacterial counts, short-chain fatty
      acid formation, and cytotoxic activity. Chemostat studies were then performed to 
      determine whether there was a direct correlation between bifidobacteria and C.
      difficile suppression. NDO were shown to stimulate bifidobacterial growth, and
      there were concomitant reductions in C. difficile populations. However, in the
      presence of clindamycin, activity against bifidobacteria was augmented in the
      presence of NDO, resulting in a further loss of colonization resistance. In the
      absence of clindamycin, NDO enhanced colonization resistance against C.
      difficile, although this could not be attributed to bifidobacterium-induced
      inhibitory phenomena.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of pouchitis.
PG  - 75-87
AB  - Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical procedure
      of choice for the management of ulcerative colitis. Pouchitis, a non-specific
      inflammation of the ileal reservoir, is the most frequent complication that
      patients experience in the long-term. Diagnosis should be made on the basis of
      clinical, endoscopic and histological aspects. The Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index (PDAI) represents an objective and reproducible scoring system for
      pouchitis: active pouchitis is defined as a score > or = 7 and remission as a
      score < 7. About 15% of patients develop a chronic disease. Treatment of
      pouchitis is empirical, and very few controlled studies have been carried out.
      Antibiotics, particularly metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are the treatment of
      choice. Chronic pouchitis may benefit from a prolonged course of a combination of
      antibiotics. Highly concentrated probiotics are effective for both prevention of 
      relapses and prevention of pouchitis onset. There is no convincing evidence of
      the efficacy of other therapeutic agents.

TI  - Novel therapies in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 483-90
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon of unknown
      cause. Its course is one of relapse and remission and requires therapy for both
      the induction and maintenance of remission. Progress in the fields of genetics
      and immunology affords important advances in our understanding of the
      inflammatory process. Traditional therapy for ulcerative colitis with nonspecific
      anti-inflammatories remains our gold standard. This review examines the most
      recent compounds in development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis,
      including data from early clinical trials and the potential clinical impact of
      future entities.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of patients with pouchitis.
PG  - 453-61
AB  - Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication of ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis in patients with underlying ulcerative colitis. Clinical symptoms of 
      pouchitis are not specific, and they can be caused by other conditions such as
      rectal cuff inflammation and irritable pouch syndrome. Therefore, to make an
      accurate diagnosis, endoscopic evaluation together with symptom assessment is
      necessary. Among five available treat-first and test-first strategies, the
      initial approach with pouch endoscopy without histology was the most
      cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of pouchitis. On the basis of clinical 
      course, pouchitis can be classified into acute, relapsing and chronic forms.
      Pouchitis can also be classified into three categories based on the response to
      antibacterial therapy: antibacterial-responsive; antibacterial-dependent; and
      antibacterial-resistant. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are both effective in
      treating acute pouchitis. Although antibacterial therapy can induce and maintain 
      remission, probiotics such as VSL#3 can also be used as to maintain clinical
      remission and prevent relapse in patients with relapsing or chronic pouchitis.
      For patients with chronic pouchitis that is resistant to antibacterials, therapy 
      with anti-inflammatory agents and immunomodulators is often required.

TI  - Modification of intestinal flora in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 333-46
AB  - Because the intestinal microflora play an important role in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in the
      manipulation of the composition of the microflora towards a potentially more
      remedial community. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy
      of the manipulation of microflora by the use of prebiotics, probiotics,
      synbiotics, and antibiotics in IBD. Prebiotics, defined as nondigestible food
      ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the
      growth or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already
      resident in the colon, can modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the
      number of specific bacteria and thus changing the composition of the microbiota. 
      Prebiotics for IBD include lactosucrose, oligofructose, inulin, bran, psyllium,
      and germinated barley foodstuff (GBF). GBF, which mainly consists of dietary
      fiber and glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic foodstuff for ulcerative
      colitis. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient for
      colonocytes through Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium and also inactivate nuclear
      factor kappa B (NFkB). Moreover, it exhibits a potent water-holding capacity and 
      bile-acid binding capacity. Probiotics, which are microbial food supplements that
      beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, have 
      been used to change the composition of colonic microbiota. The approaches for IBD
      include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium-fermented
      milk. Use of Lactococci secreting IL-10 provides excellent results. The
      combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a synbiotic has not been studied in
      IBD but is promising. The use of antibiotics continues to be of interest.
      Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some
      settings, more clinical study is needed to firmly establish the relevance of
      these therapies.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of the effect of bifidobacteria-fermented milk on
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 56-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations of intestinal flora, such as reduction in the
      concentration of bifidobacteria and increase in that of Bacteroides species, are 
      apparently associated with the severity of ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: We
      conducted a randomised clinical trial of the use of a bifidobacteria-fermented
      milk (BFM) supplement as a dietary adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a group
      with BFM supplementation (BFM group, 11 subjects) and a control group (control
      group, 10 subjects). The BFM group was given 100 mL/day of BFM for one year.
      Colonoscopies, general blood markers and examinations of intestinal flora
      including the analysis of fecal organic acids were performed at the commencement 
      of the study and after one year. RESULTS: Exacerbation of symptoms was seen in 3 
      out of 11 subjects in the BFM group and in 9 out of 10 in the control group. Log 
      rank statistic analysis of the cumulative exacerbation rates showed a significant
      reduction in exacerbations for the BFM group (p = 0.0184). The analysis of
      microflora and the organic acids in the feces showed a significant reduction in
      the relative proportion of B. vulgatus in Bacteroidaceae and butyrate
      concentration, respectively, after supplementation with BFM, in comparison with
      before. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with the BFM product was successful in
      maintaining remission and had possible preventive effects on the relapse of
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - Use of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function.
      A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly
      demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live
      non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial
      balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this
      potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is 
      enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer.
      Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can
      prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical
      studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of
      remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an
      ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment
      of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively
      establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues
      such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple
      strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that
      treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative
      approaches are explored.
