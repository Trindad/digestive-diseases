TI  - [Increased IgE-type antibody response to food allergens in irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 797-802
AB  - BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed
      defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively
      referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from
      dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the
      components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of 
      IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the 
      most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies
      against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and
      IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a
      healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency
      of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of
      the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food
      allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the
      immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control
      group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk
      protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of
      food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group,
      the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of 
      food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of
      this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a 
      diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate
      which is useful therapy in food allergy.

TI  - [Role of the Shiga toxin in the hemolytic uremic syndrome].
PG  - 11-5
AB  - In the last years, infection associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
      coli (STEC) and subsequent Hemolitic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) became relevant as a
      public health since it was considered as one of the most important emergent
      patogen present in the food contaminated by cattle feces. STEC infection may be
      asymptomatic or begins with a watery diarrhea that may or may not progress to
      bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis) and HUS. In Argentina, HUS is the most
      common pediatric cause of acute renal insufficiency and the second cause of
      chronic renal failure. Up to now, STEC infection lacks of known effective
      treatment strategies that diminish risk of progression to HUS. The mechanisms by 
      which Shiga toxin (Stx) induce HUS may help to find strategies to prevent or
      ameliorate HUS. In this article, recent progress that has contributed to
      understanding the disease pathogenesis of STEC is reviewed. New strategies to
      prevent further uptake of Shiga from the gut, either during the diarrheal phase
      or once HUS has developed are discussed.

TI  - Probiotics and the incidence of colorectal cancer: when evidence is not evident.
PG  - S277-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second major cause of death from
      cancer in Europe and in the USA. Dietary factors and colonic microflora seem to
      play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, making the potential
      protective role of probiotics of overwhelming interest. METHODS AND AIM: This
      article analyzes existing data from basic science (animal and in vitro models)
      and human (epidemiological and interventional) studies to highlight areas for
      which more evidence is necessary. We interrogated Medline for studies analysing
      the risk of CRC and the use of probiotics and also screened the references of
      identified papers. RESULTS: As far as regards animal models, we identified 29
      studies aimed at evaluating the effect of probiotics administration on the
      incidence of CRC and/or of precursor lesions. All but one study using an animal
      model with spontaneous tumour growth in the background of colitis employed
      carcinogens, and most studies employed Lactobacilli or Bifidobacteria. All but 3 
      studies had positive results, and when prebiotics were evaluated too, the
      combination led to an important synergistic effect. The protective effect of
      probiotics seemed more important when they were administered before, and not
      after the carcinogen, and the putative mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Five 
      papers evaluated the effect of probiotics on CRC cell lines in vitro, with
      results suggesting the ability of probiotics to modulate important cell functions
      and in a complex interplay. There are few human epidemiological studies
      specifically designed to analyze the effect of probiotics on CRC incidence, with 
      important confounding factors, such as role of fibers, other dairy products and
      vitamin D often present. Overall, these studies fail to detect significant
      effects of fermented milks against CRC. Interventional studies suggest reduction 
      of surrogate markers for CRC risk. However, one recent study showed no
      significant difference in the development of new CRC following administration of 
      either fibers or probiotics in patients previously treated for colon neoplasm. A 
      single randomised, double blind, placebo controlled pilot interventional trial
      aimed to evaluate the reduction in cancer risk biomarkers obtainable with the
      consumption of a symbiotic has been designed and started but a complete final
      report is not yet available. CONCLUSIONS: In our search of the literature few and
      conflicting epidemiologic data regarding the impact of fermented dairy products
      consumption in humans have been gathered. There are no positive data from
      interventional studies so far. Therefore, even though an ample body of evidence
      supports the potential anticarcinogenic action of probiotics on the basis of the 
      results obtained in both in vitro and in vivo models, further evidence is very
      much needed.

PG  - 1965-73
AB  - Genetic predisposition, nutritional and environmental influences, intestinal
      pathogens, psychological stress, and disturbed intestinal barrier function have
      been accepted as important factors in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Uncontrolled reactions of T-cells and proinflammatoric cytokines 
      are the common denominator of all factors contributing to pathogenesis. The
      detection of NOD2 gene mutation in about 25% of patients with Crohn's disease was
      an important step towards an understanding of the molecular background of the
      disease. The NOD2 proteins functions as an intracellular sensor of bacterial cell
      membrane constituents and is a crucial part of the innate immune system. In
      Crohn's disease, the secretion of defensins, naturally occurring antimicrobial
      peptides, is disturbed. There is evidence that several pathways involved in the
      reaction of the innate immune system may be disturbed in CED, ultimately leading 
      to an uncontrolled activity of the adaptive immune system.

TI  - Are probiotics effective in the treatment of fungal colonization of the
      gastrointestinal tract? Experimental and clinical studies.
PG  - 35-49
AB  - UNLABELLED: The influence of fungal colonization and probiotic treatment on the
      course of gastric ulcer (GU) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was not explored. Our
      studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and
      ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60
      patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group.
      Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated.
      Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative
      examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included
      estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI
      tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without
      probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically
      (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area,
      gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines
      IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative
      examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical
      studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and
      patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing 
      and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of 
      animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower
      than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of
      TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all 
      rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in
      92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and
      inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic 
      therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal
      colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the
      duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is
      associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).

TI  - Clinical usefulness of probiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 23-33
AB  - Probiotics are live nonpathogenic bacteria or bacterial components that may be
      helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults and children
      and have some effects on the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Many
      experimental and clinical studies suggest that intestinal bacterial flora plays
      an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and manipulation of the luminal
      contents with antibiotics or probiotics represents a potentially effective
      therapeutic option. The beneficial effect of probiotics was demonstrated mainly
      in the prevention and treatment of pouchitis and in maintaining remission of mild
      to moderate ulcerative colitis. Probiotics seems to be less effective in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Randomized clinical trials are still required to further
      define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents. This review
      summarizes the current data about probiotics in IBD.

TI  - Ischemic colitis associated with use of a bitter orange-containing dietary
      weight-loss supplement.
PG  - 1630-1
AB  - Since the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of dietary supplements
      containing ephedra in February 2004, numerous "ephedra-free" weight-loss products
      have appeared on the market. Many of these supplements contain compounds such as 
      bitter orange that are similar in structure and action to ephedra. We describe a 
      patient in whom ischemic colitis developed 1 week after initiation of a bitter
      orange-containing weight-loss supplement. The patient had no other predisposing
      factors, and discontinuation of the supplement led to immediate improvement and
      ultimate resolution of her symptoms. Both consumers and health care professionals
      should be aware of the potential harm that bitter orange-containing dietary
      supplements can cause and report such adverse events to the US Food and Drug
      Administration.

TI  - The role of antibiotic and probiotic therapies in current and future management
      of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 486-98
AB  - Abundant evidence indicates that the intestinal microflora have a role in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The composition of the gut
      microflora is altered in IBD patients with increased "pathogenic" bacteria and
      decreased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. In light of this dysbiosis, various
      methods have been examined to alter the composition of the intestinal microflora,
      including the administration of antibiotics and introduction of probiotic
      species. This article summarizes studies evaluating the efficacy of antibiotics
      and probiotics in the induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, and pouchitis.

TI  - Effect of fortification on the osmolality of human milk.
PG  - 1400-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human milk is nutritionally better than formula milk for preterm
      infants. However, unfortified human milk may fail to meet the theoretical
      requirements of very low birth weight (VLBW). Human milk fortifier (HMF)
      increases the nutritional content of human milk. However, the important factor of
      concern in feeding VLBW is the osmolality, the higher the osmolality, the greater
      the risk of necrotizing entero colitis (NEC). Therefore, high osmolality in
      fortified human milk should be considered for this condition. OBJECTIVE: To
      evaluate the effect of fortification on the osmolality of human milk. MATERIAL
      AND METHOD: Twenty samples of human milk were collected from mothers of
      gestational age less than 32 weeks, at about 1 week postpartum in Songklanagarind
      Hospital. The osmolality of each sample was determined at baseline and after
      supplementation with HMF at 10 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours at room temperature 
      and 24 hours at 4 degrees C in a refrigerator. RESULTS: The mean osmolalities
      (SD) of human milk and HMF dissolved in sterile water were 285.3 (3.3) mOsm/kg
      H2O and 64.6 (0.7) mOsm/kg H2O, respectively. Thus, the expected osmolality of
      human milk after supplementation with HMF was 349 mOsm/kg H2O. Mean measured
      osmolalities (SD) of human milk after supplementation with HMF at 10 minutes, and
      1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours was 394.7 (2.9), 399.5 (2.8), 402.1 (2.2), 401.0 (2.7),
      401.3 (2.3) and 401.2 (3.1) mOsm/kg H2O, respectively. The mean osmolality at 10 
      minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours were significantly higher than human milk (p <
      0.001) and the mean osmolality at 10_minutes was significantly higher than
      expected osmolality (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences among
      groups of osmolality after supplementation with HMF at 10 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6,
      and 24 hours (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The supplementation of human milk with HMF
      induced an increase in osmolality after mixing. The osmolality, after mixing with
      HMF which was about 400 mOsm/kg H2O, creates a greater risk of NEC. Therefore,
      HMF milk should be considered for feeding in only high risk preterm neonates.

TI  - Carrageenan induces interleukin-8 production through distinct Bcl10 pathway in
      normal human colonic epithelial cells.
PG  - G829-38
AB  - Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the 
      texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last
      half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in
      rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies 
      to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human
      intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal
      epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were
      treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1
      mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB,
      IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by
      immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, 
      nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion
      were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA
      markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the
      NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human
      intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory
      pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of
      IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to
      that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's
      disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and
      environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use
      of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical
      significance.

TI  - Escherichia coli: on-farm contamination of animals.
PG  - 555-69
AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the main inhabitants of the intestinal tract of most
      mammalian species, including humans, and birds. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
      (STEC), also called verotoxinogenic E. coli, usually do not cause disease in
      animals but may cause watery diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis, and/or haemolytic
      uraemic syndrome in humans. Zoonotic STEC include the O157:H7 strains and, with
      increasing frequency, certain non-O157 strains. The importance of non-O157
      zoonotic strains is probably underestimated as they have been less well
      characterised and are more difficult to detect in samples than O157:H7. Another
      large subset of STEC strains has been isolated from animals but has not, at the
      present time, been associated with disease in animals or humans. Cattle and other
      ruminants are the most important reservoir of zoonotic STEC, which are
      transmitted to humans through the ingestion of foods or water contaminated with
      animal faeces, or through direct contact with the infected animals or their
      environment. The main sources of STEC infection of cattle on-farm are the
      drinking water, the feed, and the immediate environment of the animal. Risk
      factors that have been identified for infection of animals with O157 STEC include
      age, weaning, movement of the animals, season, feed composition, and the ability 
      of the bacteria to persist in the environment. On-farm control of the zoonotic
      risk of human infection with STEC should primarily target the main source of
      contamination: the animal reservoir. Various strategies to reduce intestinal
      colonisation of cattle by zoonotic STEC have been tried with varying results,
      including vaccination, treatment with probiotics, such as direct-fed microbials
      or competitive exclusion, administration of bacteriophages, and modification of
      the diet.

TI  - Accumulation of mast cells in the interstitium of eosinophilic colitis.
PG  - 228-30
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The mechanism of eosinophilic colitis remains unclear, and no case 
      has been reported in which the number of mast cells was examined. CASE REPORT: A 
      35-year-old man presented to our hospital with chief complaints of chills and
      consistent watery diarrhea after eating raw fresh-water fish. In blood
      examination, peripheral blood eosinophilia was found. Histological examination
      from biopsy specimens of both the ascending colon and rectum showed a prominent
      eosinophilic infiltration in the intestinal mucosa. Although a provocation test
      could not be performed due to lack of informed consent, a diagnosis of
      eosinophilic colitis was made on the basis of other findings. Immunohistochemical
      staining for human mast cell tryptase using monoclonal antibody against human
      mast cell tryptase showed an accumulation of mast cells in the colonic
      interstitium. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of eosinophilic colitis in which an
      accumulation of mast cells in the colonic interstitium was demonstrated.

TI  - Prevalence and pathogenicity of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in beef
      cattle and their products.
PG  - E63-72
AB  - During the past 23 yr, a large number of human illness outbreaks have been traced
      worldwide to consumption of undercooked ground beef and other beef products
      contaminated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Although several
      routes exist for human infection with STEC, beef remains a main source. Thus,
      beef cattle are considered reservoirs of O157 and nonO157 STEC. Because of the
      global nature of the food supply, safety concerns with beef will continue, and
      the challenges facing the beef industry will increase at the production and
      processing levels. To be prepared to address these concerns and challenges, it is
      critical to assess the beef cattle role in human infection with STEC. Because
      most STEC outbreaks in the United States were traced to beef containing E. coli
      O157:H7, the epidemiological studies have focused on the prevalence of this
      serotype in beef and beef cattle. Worldwide, however, additional STEC serotypes
      (e.g., members of the O26, O91, O103, O111, O118, O145, and O166 serogroups) have
      been isolated from beef and caused human illnesses ranging from bloody diarrhea
      and hemorrhagic colitis to the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 
      To provide a global assessment of the STEC problem, published reports on beef and
      beef cattle in the past 3 decades were evaluated. The prevalence rates of E. coli
      O157 ranged from 0.1 to 54.2% in ground beef, from 0.1 to 4.4% in sausage, from
      1.1 to 36.0% in various retail cuts, and from 0.01 to 43.4% in whole carcasses.
      The corresponding prevalence rates of nonO157 STEC were 2.4 to 30.0%, 17.0 to
      49.2%, 11.4 to 49.6%, and 1.7 to 58.0%, respectively. Of the 162 STEC serotypes
      isolated from beef products, 43 were detected in HUS patients and 36 are known to
      cause other human illnesses. With regard to beef cattle, the prevalence rates of 
      E. coli O157 ranged from 0.3 to 19.7% in feedlots and from 0.7 to 27.3% on
      pasture. The corresponding prevalence rates of nonO157 STEC were 4.6 to 55.9% and
      4.7 to 44.8%, respectively. Of the 373 STEC serotypes isolated from cattle feces 
      or hides, 65 were detected in HUS patients and 62 are known to cause other human 
      illnesses. The results indicated the prevalence of a large number of pathogenic
      STEC in beef and beef cattle at high rates and emphasized the critical need for
      control measures to assure beef safety.

TI  - [Probiotics--should we change the treatment strategy for pouchitis?].
PG  - 3516-8
AB  - Pouchitis is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, which occurs in up to 50% 
      of patients operated on for ulcerative colitis with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 
      (IPAA). Treatment of pouchitis is still to a large extent empirical, but recently
      more randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have been conducted. This
      article reviews the possible treatments for pouchitis, focusing especially on
      treatment with probiotics, which seem to be a new and promising alternative to
      antibiotics. We are currently doing clinical trials to determine whether a
      probiotic is an effective treatment for chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotics: do they help to control intestinal inflammation?
PG  - 339-50
AB  - There is currently a growing appreciation for the role of the enteric flora in
      health and disease. In the past years overwhelming evidence has accumulated for
      the role of commensal gut bacteria in the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Both entities are mainly located in areas with
      high bacterial concentrations. Reduction of the enteric bacterial concentration
      by antibiotics, lavage, or surgical bypass results in a mitigation of symptoms,
      while experimental colitis models depend on the presence of the bacterial flora
      and the NOD2/CARD15-mutation results in inefficient clearance of invasive
      bacteria. Those findings helped to bring the concept of probiotic therapy to the 
      forefront, a therapy that had been known for millennia, but had been disregarded 
      by the scientific world. Probiotics are meanwhile established in the maintenance 
      therapy of ulcerative colitis and chronic recurrent or refractory pouchitis.
      Promising data exist for the primary prevention of pouchitis. Probiotic research 
      at the intersection of gastroenterology, immunology and microbiology is highly
      dynamic in both the basic and the clinical field. Further understanding of the
      complex molecular mechanisms leading to the effectiveness of probiotics will also
      spur the development of more successful probiotic formulations.

TI  - Therapeutic drug delivery by genetically modified Lactococcus lactis.
PG  - 176-86
AB  - Food-grade bacteria have been consumed throughout history without associated
      pathologies and are, therefore, absolutely safe to ingest. Unexpectedly,
      Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), known from cheese production, can be genetically 
      engineered to constantly secrete satisfactory amounts of bioactive cytokines.
      Both of these features enabled the development of a new kind of topical delivery 
      system: topical and active delivery of therapeutic proteins by genetically
      modified micro-organisms. The host organism's record inspired the development of 
      applications that target intestinal diseases. In a variety of mouse models,
      chronic colon inflammation can be successfully treated with (interleukin)
      IL-10-secreting L. lactis. Trefoil factor (TFF) producer strains have also been
      shown to be very effective in the treatment of acute colitis. Such novel
      therapeutic strains are textbook examples of genetically modified (GM) organisms.
      There are legitimate concerns with regard to the deliberate release of GM
      micro-organisms. On development of these applications, therefore, we have
      engineered these bacteria in such a way that biological containment is
      guaranteed. The essential gene thyA, encoding thymidylate synthase, has been
      exchanged for IL-10. This makes the GM strain critically dependent on thymidine. 
      Lack of thymidine, for example, resulting from thymidine consumption by
      thyA-deficient strains-will irreversibly lead to induced "thymidine-less death." 
      This accomplishment has created the possibility of using this strategy for
      application in human medicine.

TI  - Interventions for treating collagenous colitis.
PG  - CD003575
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of
      chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This
      review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been
      proven in randomized trials. OBJECTIVES: To determine effective treatments for
      patients with clinically active collagenous colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant
      papers published between 1970 and June 2006 were identified via the MEDLINE and
      PUBMED databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as
      well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to
      identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings
      were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the 
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register were searched
      for other studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Seven randomized trials were identified.
      One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), one
      trial studied Boswellia serrata extract (published in abstract form only), one
      trial studied probiotics, one trial studied prednisolone, and 3 trials studied
      budesonide for the therapy of collagenous colitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Data were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment
      versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one
      trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies
      assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the
      Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis
      only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition. MAIN RESULTS: There
      were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth
      subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active
      drug were more likely to have clinical (p = 0.003) and histological (p = 0.003)
      improvement than those assigned to placebo. Eleven patients were enrolled in the 
      trial studying prednisolone (50 mg daily for 2 weeks). There was a trend towards 
      clinical response in patients on active medication compared to placebo (p =
      0.064). The effect of prednisolone on histologic improvement was not studied.
      Thirty-one patients were enrolled in the Boswellia serrata extract trial.
      Clinical improvement was noted in 44% of patients who received active treatment
      compared to 27% of patients who received placebo (p = 0.32). Twenty-nine patients
      were enrolled in the probiotics trial. Clinical improvement was noted in 29% of
      patients who received probiotics compared to 13% of patients who received placebo
      (p = 0.635). A total of 94 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide
      (9 mg daily or in a tapering schedule for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio
      for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 12.32 (95% CI 5.53-27.46),
      with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological
      improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.
      Budesonide also appears to improve patients' quality of life. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is effective for the treatment of collagenous colitis.
      The evidence for benefit with bismuth subsalicylate is weaker. The effectiveness 
      of prednisolone, Boswellia serrata extract, probiotics and other therapies for
      induction or maintenance of remission of collagenous colitis is unknown and
      requires further study.

TI  - Current therapy of inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 279-302
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal
      inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
      malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However,
      there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that
      are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during
      childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays
      in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the
      changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from
      school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring
      for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic
      therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed
      surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease
      and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This
      article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD
      and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The
      principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC 
      are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), 
      and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the
      induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse
      include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with
      creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of 
      care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved
      quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using
      increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case
      against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or
      potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management
      of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g.
      gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the
      disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. 
      Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics
      (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric
      formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for
      corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates,
      mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as
      maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is
      typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease
      limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum)
      or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or
      abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications
      administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD
      are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, 
      iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In
      addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of
      developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance
      program after 8-10 years of disease duration.

PG  - 1907-18
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is an important disease in the paediatric population.
      Ulcerative colitis is one of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, and is
      medically incurable. However, the arsenal of medications has grown as knowledge
      of the pathogenesis of this disease advances. This review looks at the classical 
      treatments for children with ulcerative colitis, including the
      5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and imunomodulators, as well as biological
      therapy and other, newer modalities.

TI  - Medical management of left-sided ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis:
      critical evaluation of therapeutic trials.
PG  - 979-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this work was to critically evaluate the published
      studies on the treatment of ulcerative proctitis (UP) and left-sided ulcerative
      colitis (L-UC). The results of this review provided the content for the
      accompanying treatment guidelines, Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management
      of Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Summary Statement.
      METHODS: All English language articles published between 1995 and September 2005 
      were identified through a comprehensive literature search using OVID and PubMed. 
      The quality of the data supporting or rejecting the use of specific therapies was
      categorized by a data quality grading scale. An "A+" grade was assigned to
      treatment supported by multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials with
      consistent results, whereas a "D" grade was given to therapy supported only by
      expert opinion. The therapeutic efficacy of a treatment was defined by its
      success in treating UP and L-UC compared with placebo. A medication was ranked as
      "excellent" if it was specifically studied for UP and L-UC and had consistently
      positive results compared with placebo or another agent. Quality and efficacy
      scores were agreed on by author consensus. RESULTS: For the acute treatment of UP
      or L-UC, the rectally administered corticosteroids and mesalazine (5-ASA), either
      alone or in combination with oral 5-ASAs, are the most effective therapy:
      evidence quality, A+; efficacy, excellent. Only rectally administered 5-ASA
      received an A+/excellent rating for maintenance of remission. Infliximab received
      an A+ grade for induction and maintenance of remission but only a "good" rating
      because the studies were performed in all UC, not specifically UP or L-UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: This critical evaluation of treatment provides a "report card" on
      medications available for the management of patients with UP and L-UC. The
      guidelines should provide a useful reference and supplement for physicians
      treating UC patients.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 5941-50
AB  - The prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of the colon exist in a highly complex, but 
      harmonious relationship. Disturbances in this remarkable symbiosis can result in 
      the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the etiology of
      IBD is not entirely understood, it is known that the chronic inflammation of
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis are a result of an
      overly aggressive immune response to the commensal intestinal flora in
      genetically susceptible hosts. Recent studies have enhanced our ability to
      understand the interaction between the host and its intestinal microflora and the
      role the microflora plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. As we begin to
      understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion 
      of modifying the composition of the bacterial load to improve human health has
      arisen. A significant body of research now exists investigating the role of
      probiotics and prebiotics in ameliorating chronic intestinal inflammation. This
      article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in
      maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to
      the intestinal microflora results in IBD. This will be followed by a summary of
      the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD.

AB  - Current data show that probiotics are more effective in preventing the
      recrudescence of an inflammatory process than in suppressing active disease. This
      is reflected in the solid evidence for the effect of E. coli Nissle 1917
      (Mutaflor) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and of VSL#3 in
      preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. These indications have since been
      incorporated in valid guidelines. Initial clinical studies have also provided
      promising results regarding the efficacy of VSL#3 in preventing pouchitis
      immediately following proctocolectomy.

TI  - [Therapeutic possibilities of probiotics in antibiotic-related diarrhea].
PG  - 28-30
AB  - One of the major problems associated with the use of antibiotics is the
      occurrence of antibiotic-related diarrhea. Although most such cases of diarrhea
      are harmless, in individual cases it may lead on to fulminant colitis. In 10-20% 
      of the patients, the causal factor is infection with Clostridium difficile, which
      multiplies unhindered in patients on antibiotics. In the meantime, controlled,
      randomized studies have shown that probiotics can exercise a preventive effect in
      antibiotic-related diarrhea. The administration of Saccharomyces boulardii or
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG reduces the relative risk of an antibiotic-related
      diarrhea developing by 0.5. The data are more uniform in children than in adults.

PG  - 383-5
AB  - Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome
      is a rare, fatal autoimmune disorder caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene
      leading to the disruption of signaling pathways involved in regulatory
      T-lymphocyte function. Lifelong multiagent immunosuppression is necessary to
      control debilitating autoimmune manifestations such as colitis and food
      allergies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can restore 
      T-cell regulatory function but has been previously associated with poor outcome. 
      We describe successful HSCT in 4 patients with IPEX syndrome using a novel
      reduced-intensity conditioning regimen that resulted in stable donor engraftment,
      reconstitution of FOXP3+ T regulatory CD4+ cells, and amelioration of
      gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI  - Is there any food I can eat? Living with inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
      and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair
      quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living.
      Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the
      evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders,
      particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the
      strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning 
      coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall
      objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had
      been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome.
      This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable
      bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females,
      diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were
      recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada.
      Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires,
      e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed 
      for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means 
      by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or
      controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of
      determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of 
      stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research,
      predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates 
      the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women
      identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that
      they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health 
      nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.

      contamination of the field surface water along the M'Poko River upstream of the
      Oubangui River where fish are caught, appear to be important contributory
      factors. We also describe novel strains of serogroup O157:NM isolated from zebu
      and from fish; a variety of assays indicate that these strains belong to the
      enteropathogenic pathotype, though they lack certain genetic elements thought to 
      be diagnostic for this pathotype.

PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Data on food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are scarce. The aim
      of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the
      nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and
      Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31%
      men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more
      foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea
      (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy
      foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool
      consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions,
      cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The
      urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than
      after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool
      consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates
      that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base
      their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-)
      physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.

PG  - 90-5
AB  - Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial
      bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to
      them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora
      produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous
      important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the
      colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of 
      mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear
      translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent
      anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear 
      to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use
      probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. 
      It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal
      pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts
      of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high
      degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability 
      of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and
      probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and
      pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.

TI  - Review article: the role of bacteria in onset and perpetuation of inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - We review the evidence that strongly suggests a role of the intestinal microbiota
      in the onset and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Experimental
      studies consisted of suppressing micro-organisms from the microbiota (using
      germ-free or gnotoxenic animals or antibiotics), introducing new micro-organisms 
      or microbial components (e.g. probiotics, CpG-DNA) or selectively increasing some
      endogenous bacteria (e.g. using prebiotics). Intervention studies were performed 
      in patients or animal models of spontaneous or chemically-induced colitis.
      Information was also obtained from observational studies that described the
      composition of the faecal and mucosal microbiota at various stages of the disease
      process and in controls. Many have used culture-independent techniques that
      identify bacteria based on the nucleic acid sequence of ribosomal RNA molecules. 
      Microbiota in patients with IBD seem to be characterized by high concentrations
      of bacteria in contact with the mucosa, instability, the presence of high numbers
      of unusual bacteria and sometimes a reduction in the biodiversity. Studies
      searching for a generalized or localized dysbiosis in IBD are discussed, as well 
      as those trying to identify bacterial molecules and receptors, which may be
      implicated in triggering the inflammatory process.

PG  - 5799-805
AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in
      inflammatory bowel disease. However, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is
      needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when
      intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. In this
      context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three
      lactobacilli (LAB) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using
      variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (TNBS)-induced acute colitis. We first compared the in vitro ability of LAB to
      survive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions and their ability to persist in
      the GIT of mice following daily oral administration. As a control, we included a 
      nonprobiotic Lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an
      endocarditis patient. Feeding high doses of LAB strains to healthy and to
      TNBS-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation
      of the bacteria. Oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 had a
      significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while Lactobacillus plantarum
      Lp-115 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM did not. None of the three selected LAB
      strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of TNBS-treated mice. In contrast,
      L. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and
      translocated to extraintestinal organs. This study showed that evaluations of the
      safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. We conclude that not 
      all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that
      selected probiotics such as L. salivarius Ls-33 may be considered in the
      prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 475-84
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease is thought to result from an
      abnormal response to the gut microbiota. This review discusses advances in
      knowledge of the changes in gut microbiota and host response in inflammatory
      bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 15% of Crohn's disease cases in
      western populations result from mutations in NOD2/CARD15. This disease leads to
      defective intestinal defensin production and defective monocyte interleukin-8
      response to bacterial peptidoglycan. A similar defective interleukin-8 response
      and consequent delayed neutrophil recruitment have also been shown in patients
      with Crohn's disease who do not have the NOD2 mutation. A consequence seems to be
      the accumulation in tissue of macrophages containing various bacteria, perhaps
      particularly Escherichia coli. In keeping with this patients with Crohn's disease
      have circulating antibodies against bacterial flagellar proteins of
      enterobacteria and clostridia. In ulcerative colitis, there is less evidence for 
      invasion by or immune response to bacteria but changes in gut microbiota include 
      a relative deficiency of bifidobacteria. There is considerable interest in
      probiotic or prebiotic therapies although so far little evidence for their
      efficacy. SUMMARY: Molecular techniques are giving us better insight into the gut
      microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease that should translate into improved
      therapies.

TI  - Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, 
      or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore
      expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics,
      whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to
      incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for 
      prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the
      Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large 
      intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer,
      focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language.
      Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or
      meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose,
      galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large
      bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These
      carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and
      intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small.
      Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few,
      although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel
      disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early
      days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial
      balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.

TI  - Tacrolimus-associated eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis in pediatric liver
      transplant recipients: role of potential food allergies in pathogenesis.
PG  - 730-5
AB  - Tacrolimus is a macrolide agent that is now the primary immunosuppressant used in
      prevention of graft rejection in transplant recipients. It has been found to be
      superior to cyclosporine (CSA) for rescue therapy as well as for earlier weaning 
      of steroids. Both tacrolimus and CSA share similar toxicity profiles; however,
      their gastrointestinal side effects have received little attention. We report
      three cases of eosinophilic colitis in liver transplant recipients, maintained on
      tacrolimus as immunosuppressive medication post-liver transplantation. These
      patients also had high serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels, eosinophilia and
      IgE-positive radioallergosorbent test for milk proteins. The colitis appeared to 
      be mediated by food allergies. Each patient had symptomatic improvement following
      reduced immunosuppression and an appropriately restricted diet. We conclude that 
      tacrolimus may play a role in the initiation of food allergies, leading to
      eosinophilic colitis. More studies are needed in a controlled setting to identify
      the prevalence of similar findings among other pediatric liver transplant
      recipients.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 1371-87
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live
      freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human
      gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli
      (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp.
      bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve
      and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from
      noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment 
      of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised,
      open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose
      balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was
      more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the
      treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset 
      of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in
      maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in
      patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment
      guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the
      prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general,
      VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled
      confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Case closed? Diverticulitis: epidemiology and fiber.
PG  - S112-6
AB  - A major advance in understanding diverticular disease occurred decades ago with
      the epidemiologic association between fiber intake and the development of
      diverticular disease. This association has been well documented with
      investigations into the emergence of diverticular disease in underdeveloped
      countries where the disease had been virtually unknown before the adoption of a
      westernized diet, low in fiber. The high frequency of right-sided diverticular
      disease in Asian countries diverges from what is seen in the West. The
      physiologic effects of insoluble fiber has been well examined as well, increasing
      bulk and decreasing transit time, with a deficiency contributing to the high
      pressures implicated in the physiology which leads to diverticular disease.
      However, at most, 10% to 25% of individuals with diverticular disease will
      develop diverticulitis. Risk factors for symptomatic diverticular have been
      increasingly described in recent years with obesity and red meat intake being of 
      particular importance, in addition to age. However, the known factors poorly
      identify those at increased risk and the predisposing pathophysiology is
      incompletely understood as well. Insoluble fiber, but not soluble fiber, has been
      viewed as the principal component which has been deficient in western diets and
      is the culprit which leads to the establishment of diverticular disease and in
      turn, diverticulitis. Soluble fiber and its effect on the intestinal flora is
      proposed as having significant influence on the development of diverticulitis.
      This understanding, if demonstrated, would have important implications for the
      primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches targeting intestinal microflora in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 4452-60
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, are chronic
      intestinal disorders of unknown etiology in which in genetically susceptible
      individuals, the mucosal immune system shows an aberrant response towards
      commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract has developed ingenious mechanisms
      to coexist with its autologous microflora, but rapidly responds to invading
      pathogens and then returns to homeostasis with its commensal bacteria after the
      pathogenic infection is cleared. In case of disruption of this tightly-regulated 
      homeostasis, chronic intestinal inflammation may be induced. Previous studies
      showed that some commensal bacteria are detrimental while others have either no
      influence or have a protective action. In addition, each host has a genetically
      determined response to detrimental and protective bacterial species. These
      suggest that therapeutic manipulation of imbalance of microflora can influence
      health and disease. This review focuses on new insights into the role of
      commensal bacteria in gut health and disease, and presents recent findings in
      innate and adaptive immune interactions. Therapeutic approaches to modulate
      balance of intestinal microflora and their potential mechanisms of action are
      also discussed.

TI  - Toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive Clostridium difficile.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a major cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized
      patients. Many pathogenic strains of Clostridium difficile produce two toxins
      TcdA and TcdB, both of which are pro-inflammatory and enterotoxic in human
      intestine. Clinically relevant toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive (A(-)B(+))
      strains of Clostridium difficile that cause diarrhea and colitis in humans have
      been isolated with increasing frequency worldwide. This perspective describes
      these important toxin variant strains and highlights the need to use Clostridium 
      difficile diagnostic methods that can detect both TcdA and TcdB.

TI  - The bacteriology of biopsies differs between newly diagnosed, untreated, Crohn's 
      disease and ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 1141-9
AB  - The bacterial community (microbiota) that inhabits the gut of humans appears to
      be an important source of antigens that drive the chronic immunological processes
      characteristic of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Most of the
      members of the microbiota have not yet been cultured, but nucleic-acid-based
      methods of detection and enumeration can provide information about the community.
      This investigation used these methods to obtain information about the bacteria
      associated with mucosal surfaces in the gut of 20 CD and 15 UC patients. Biopsies
      were collected from inflamed and non-inflamed sites in the intestines of newly
      diagnosed, untreated patients. Biopsies were also collected from several
      intestinal sites of 14 healthy subjects. The bacterial collections associated
      with the biopsies were analysed by generating PCR/denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles, the preparation of 16S rRNA gene clone
      libraries, and qualitative PCR to detect specific groups of bacteria. The total
      numbers of bacteria associated with the biopsies were determined by real-time
      quantitative PCR. DGGE profiles generated from the terminal ileum and various
      colonic regions were characteristic of each individual but differed between
      subjects. DGGE profiles and 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacteria
      associated with inflamed and non-inflamed tissues did not differ. UC patients had
      more bacteria associated with biopsies than did CD patients (P<0.01). Statistical
      analysis of the composition of 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacterial 
      collections in UC and CD patients differed (P<0.05). Unclassified members of the 
      phylum Bacteroidetes were more prevalent in CD than in UC patients. Therefore,
      the types and numbers of bacteria associated with biopsy samples were distinctly 
      different for UC and CD patients. The observations made in this study should
      permit targeting of specific bacteriological abnormalities in investigations of
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and provide targets for medical
      interventions.

TI  - [Non-specific inflammatory bowel disease or allergic colitis in small children - 
      what is the final diagnosis].
PG  - 475-82
AB  - The reason of bleeding from alimentary tract in small children - may sometimes be
      a big problem and we may need a long observation before making the diagnosis. One
      of the most frequent reasons of bleeding is food allergy, which resembles
      allergic colitis. However, bleeding can be the first symptom of ulcerative
      colitis or Crohn's disease, but it is very rare in small children. We present
      three cases of small children with bleeding from alimentary tract, in which it
      was difficult to make the final diagnosis. In our cases, the endoscopic and
      histopathological examination showed changes, which suggested non-specific
      inflammatory bowel disease. The microabscesses in crypts and inflammatory
      infiltration in the mucosa indicated ulcerative colitis. Moreover, one child had 
      also inflammatory infiltration in the oesophagus and duodenum, which is typical
      for Crohn's disease. We conclude that even when the clinical course suggests that
      the reason of presenting symptoms was food allergy, there is need for longer
      observation until one can make the final diagnosis.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of olsalazine (dipentum) in the treatment of patients
      with ulcerative colitis--results of a field study.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the treatment of ulcerative colitis, 5-aminosalicylic acid is
      the standard therapy for both acute exacerbations of the disease and the
      maintenance of remission. Clinical studies have shown that olsalazine
      (Dipentum)--a prodrug converted to two molecules of 5-ASA by colonic
      bacteria-induces and maintains remission. This study aimed to investigate the
      efficacy and tolerability of olsalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis who
      were being treated in daily practice by private physicians specializing in
      gastroenterology. METHODOLOGY: A total of 260 patients with ulcerative colitis
      (aged 17-77 years, 116 men) were studied. The doses of olsalazine and the
      clinical data (including acute disease symptoms and the occurrence of adverse
      events) were recorded over a 6-month period. RESULTS: Twenty per cent of patients
      had pancolitis, 48% had left-sided disease and 32% had proctitis or
      proctosigmoiditis. At study entry, 86% of patients had active disease; the
      percentages of these patients in remission after 6 weeks and 6 months were 42%
      and 91%, respectively. Patients with active disease received a mean dose of
      olsalazine - 2324mg per day initially and 1325mg per day at 6 months. The
      corresponding figures for patients in remission at study entry were 1386mg and
      1162mg per day, respectively. Seventy-three per cent of patients took olsalazine 
      with food, as recommended. The overall rate of adverse events was low; no serious
      adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Olsalazine therapy resulted in a rapid
      regression in the acute symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Olsalazine was also
      effective in maintaining remission. The drug was well tolerated.

TI  - Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 ameliorates experimental colitis via
      toll-like receptor 2- and toll-like receptor 4-dependent pathways.
PG  - 4075-82
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system that
      trigger antimicrobial host defense responses. The aim of the present study was to
      analyze the effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle strain 1917 in
      experimental colitis induced in TLR-2 and TLR-4 knockout mice. Colitis was
      induced in wild-type (wt), TLR-2 knockout, and TLR-4 knockout mice via
      administration of 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Mice were treated with either 
      0.9% NaCl or 10(7) E. coli Nissle 1917 twice daily, followed by the determination
      of disease activity, mucosal damage, and cytokine secretion. wt and TLR-2
      knockout mice exposed to DSS developed acute colitis, whereas TLR-4 knockout mice
      developed significantly less inflammation. In wt mice, but not TLR-2 or TLR-4
      knockout mice, E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorated colitis and decreased
      proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In TLR-2 knockout mice a selective reduction 
      of gamma interferon secretion was observed after E. coli Nissle 1917 treatment.
      In TLR-4 knockout mice, cytokine secretion was almost undetectable and not
      modulated by E. coli Nissle 1917, indicating that TLR-4 knockout mice do not
      develop colitis similar to the wt mice. Coculture of E. coli Nissle 1917 and
      human T cells increased TLR-2 and TLR-4 protein expression in T cells and
      increased NF-kappaB activity via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In conclusion, our data provide
      evidence that E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorates experimental induced colitis in
      mice via TLR-2- and TLR-4-dependent pathways.

TI  - Dendritic cells: the commanders-in-chief of mucosal immune defenses.
PG  - 354-60
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intestinal dendritic cells have emerged as key regulators of
      immunity to pathogens, oral tolerance and intestinal inflammation. Studies have
      begun to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms responsible for defining region- and
      compartment-specific phenotypes and functions of dendritic cells in mucosal
      tissues. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific subsets of dendritic cells appear to be
      associated with the various routes for antigen acquisition in the intestine. The 
      constant sampling of intestinal antigenic content ensures establishment of
      tolerance to commensal bacteria and food antigens. Tolerance development to oral 
      antigens is restricted to the mucosal immune system. Other advances have provided
      insight into the molecular basis of microbial recognition and innate immune
      responses by intestinal dendritic cells. Differences in the involvement of
      dendritic cells have begun to emerge in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      and link gene regulation in dendritic cells to therapeutic responses. SUMMARY: A 
      major focus of mucosal immunology will be to understand how diverse dendritic
      cell subsets cooperate in regulating homeostasis and host defense in the
      different intestinal immune compartments. This will be pivotal to understanding
      how the mucosal immune system makes the distinction between commensal microbiota,
      pathogens and self antigens.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 376-82
AB  - Enteric microflora profiles vary considerably between active inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) and healthy conditions. Intestinal microflora may partake in the
      pathogenesis of IBD by one or some ways: specific pathogenic infection induces
      abnormal intestinal mucosal inflammation; aberrant microflora components trigger 
      the onset of IBD; abnormal host immune response loses normal immune tolerance to 
      luminal components; luminal antigens permeate through the defective mucosal
      barrier into mucosal lamina propria and induce abnormal inflammatory response.
      Preliminary studies suggest that administration of probiotics may be benefit for 
      experimental colitis and clinical trials for IBD. Researches have been studying
      the function of probiotics. Introduction of probiotics can balance the aberrant
      enteric microflora in IBD patients, and reinforce the various lines of intestinal
      defence by inhibiting microbial pathogens growth, increasing intestinal
      epithelial tight junction and permeability, modulating immune response of
      intestinal epithelia and mucosal immune cells, secreting antimicrobial products, 
      decomposing luminal pathogenic antigens.

TI  - Antibiotics and probiotics in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3306-13
AB  - Many experimental and clinical observations suggest that intestinal microflora
      plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Manipulation of the luminal content using antibiotics or probiotics represents a 
      potentially effective therapeutic option. The available studies do not support
      the use of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC). Antibiotics are effective in
      treating septic complications of Crohn's disease (CD) but their use as a primary 
      therapy is more controversial, although this approach is frequently and
      successfully adopted in clinical practice. There is evidence that probiotic
      therapy may be effective in the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC. 
      In contrast, a lack of successful study data at present precludes the widespread 
      use of probiotics in the treatment of CD. Both antibiotics and probiotics appear 
      to play a beneficial role in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis and
      further trials are warranted to fully quantify their clinical efficacy.

TI  - High-iron diet: foe or feat in ulcerative colitis and ulcerative
      colitis-associated carcinogenesis.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - Anemia associated with long-standing chronic inflammation and iron deficiency,
      and the increased risk for the development of dysplasia and carcinoma, are two of
      the most common complications in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Because
      of iron and nutrition deficiency, UC patients are encouraged to consume a
      high-protein and high-iron diet. The crucial clinical question is the effect of a
      high-iron diet on inflammation activity and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis.
      Is a high-iron diet a foe or a feat in UC and UC-associated carcinogenesis? This 
      review updates the progress and information on (1) iron nutrition and
      iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC, (2) experimental evidence of the
      exacerbating effect of a high-iron diet on UC and its associated carcinogenesis
      and the difference between a high-iron diet and parental iron supplementation,
      (3) the clinical efficacy of, and concerns about, oral and intravenous iron
      supplements in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency
      anemia, and (4) the clinical implications of long-term iron supplements and
      management of UC. These experimental findings from animal models provide evidence
      to warrant further consideration and clinical studies of iron nutrition,
      inflammation activity, and cancer development.

      and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of CAM in German patients with IBD. 
      METHODS: A questionnaire was offered to IBD patients participating in patient
      workshops which were organized by a self-help association, the German Crohn's and
      Colitis Association. The self-administered questionnaire included demographic and
      disease-related data as well as items analysing the extent of CAM use and
      satisfaction with CAM treatment. Seven commonly used CAM methods were
      predetermined on the questionnaire. RESULTS: 413 questionnaires were completed
      and included in the analysis (n = 153 male, n = 260 female; n = 246 Crohn's
      disease, n = 164 ulcerative colitis). 52 % of the patients reported CAM use in
      the present or past. In detail, homeopathy (55%), probiotics (43%), classical
      naturopathy (38%), Boswellia serrata extracts (36%) and acupuncture/Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) (33%) were the most frequently used CAM methods. Patients 
      using probiotics, acupuncture and Boswellia serrata extracts (incense) reported
      more positive therapeutic effects than others. Within the statistical analysis no
      significant predictors for CAM use were found. 77% of the patients felt
      insufficiently informed about CAM. CONCLUSION: The use of CAM in IBD patients is 
      very common in Germany, although a large proportion of patients felt that
      information about CAM is not sufficient. However, to provide an evidence-based
      approach more research in this field is desperately needed. Therefore, physicians
      should increasingly inform IBD patients about benefits and limitations of CAM
      treatment.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic dietary supplement Lactibiane
      Tolerance: in vitro and in vivo considerations.
PG  - 994-1003
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in 
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. In inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), where major modifications of the intestinal microflora have been
      reported, there is an increasing interest in modulating the flora with probiotic 
      products. This work addresses the anti-inflammatory potential of Lactibiane
      Tolerance, a probiotic dietary supplement (mixture of four strains) using in
      vitro and in vivo approaches. METHODS: Comparison of the four individual strains 
      and the commercial product reconstituted from them was conducted by in vitro
      tests (cytokine release after 24h stimulation of human peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC)). The potential immunomodulatory characteristics of
      Lactibiane Tolerance were determined in vivo in an acute mice model of
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Assessment of colitis
      included blinded histological and macroscopic scores. RESULTS: We showed that
      Lactibiane Tolerance has anti-inflammatory properties in vitro by stimulating
      IL-10 production and in vivo by conferring a significant protective effect in the
      TNBS-induced colitis model (more than 50% decrease of colitis symptoms, P<0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a probiotic dietary supplement,
      Lactibiane Tolerance, can significantly prevent the initial injury of TNBS and
      could stimulate the initiation of clinical trials in IBD.

TI  - ESPEN Guidelines on Enteral Nutrition: Gastroenterology.
PG  - 260-74
AB  - Undernutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and short bowel
      syndrome (SBS). The present guideline gives evidence-based recommendations for
      the indication, application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral
      nutritional supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in these patients. It was
      developed in an interdisciplinary consensus-based process in accordance with
      officially accepted standards and is based on all relevant publications since
      1985. ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished
      patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the
      first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults
      mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant
      differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and 
      whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid
      dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the
      adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in
      addition to normal food.

TI  - Efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1567-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aminosalicylates are the mainstay of therapy to prevent relapse of
      quiescent ulcerative colitis. The rationale for using probiotics is based on the 
      evidence implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
      AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG alone or in combination with
      mesalazine vs. mesalazine as maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: 187 ulcerative colitis patients with quiescent disease were
      randomized to receive Lactobacillus GG 18 x 10(9) viable bacteria/day (65
      patients), mesalazine 2400 mg/day (60 patients) or Lactobacillus GG + mesalazine 
      (62 patients). Disease activity index, endoscopic and histological scores were
      determined at 0, 6 and 12 months and in case of relapse. The primary end point
      was to evaluate sustained remission. RESULTS: Overall analysis showed no
      difference in relapse rate at 6 (P = 0.44) and 12 months (P = 0.77) among the
      three treatment groups. However, the treatment with Lactobacillus GG seems to be 
      more effective than standard treatment with mesalazine in prolonging the
      relapse-free time (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG seems to be effective
      and safe for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it
      could represent a good therapeutic option for preventing relapse in this group of
      patients.

TI  - Probiotic treatment of collagenous colitis: a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium
      animalis subsp. Lactis.
PG  - 395-401
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut
      microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential 
      pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic 
      treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of
      treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.
      lactis BB-12 (AB-Cap-10) in patients with CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients
      with CC and diarrhea were in a double-blind placebo-controlled study randomized
      (2:1) to AB-Cap-10 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction
      in bowel frequency per week of >or=50%. Secondary end points were changes in
      bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal
      bloating and pain. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were randomized: 21 to
      probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of >or=50%
      occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and
      placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were
      observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median
      reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18-84) to 23 (range 11-56; P
      < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days
      (range 0-7 days) to 1 day (range 0-7 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number 
      of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB-Cap-10 group.
      CONCLUSIONS: AB-Cap-10 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post
      hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB-Cap-10
      group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease 
      course of CC.

TI  - [Is the seric eosinophil cationic protein level a valuable tool of diagnosis in
      clinical practice?].
PG  - 679-83
AB  - SCOPE: The eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) is one of the mediators released
      during eosinophil activation. These cells are effector cells taking part into the
      Th2-lymphocyte dependent allergic inflammation. Assaying ECP concentrations in
      blood and sputum may be useful in evaluating allergic inflammation (asthma and
      rhinitis). This summary considers the value of measuring ECP levels for the
      diagnosis of various diseases where an eosinophil-mediated tissue inflammation
      plays a role. CURRENT SITUATION AND SALIENT POINTS: Levels of eosinophil cationic
      protein have been determined in nasal secretions, sputum, gastric secretions,
      feces and serum. They are increased during seasonal allergic rhinitis and
      perennial rhinitis, allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis. They are also
      increased in various gastro-intestinal disorders, some of which are associated
      with IgE: eosinophil intestinal diseases (esophagitis, gastro-enteritis and
      colitis), gastro-intestinal food allergy and intestinal parasitoses. Finally,
      they are increased in non IgE-dependent disorders: non allergic asthma with
      aspirin intolerance, respiratory infections, sinonasal polyposis, Churg-Strauss
      disease and idiopathic hyper-eosinophilia (HES) syndrome. PERSPECTIVES: Assaying 
      serum ECP could help in the diagnosis of several diseases. With parasitic disease
      the pathogenic progression may be accurately assessed, when serological tests are
      less indicative. ECP assay may point to non allergic asthma, either Fernand-Widal
      syndrome or Churg-Strauss disease. As for gastro-intestinal disorders, it
      indicates an eosinophilic tissue reaction. In the event of isolated
      hypereosinophilia, ECP assay may clarify whether it is benign or tending towards 
      idiopathic HES. The assay of peroxidase and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN)
      should be also considered.

TI  - Meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea 
      and the treatment of Clostridium difficile disease.
PG  - 812-22
AB  - CONTEXT: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common complication of most
      antibiotics and Clostridium difficile disease (CDD), which also is incited by
      antibiotics, is a leading cause of nosocomial outbreaks of diarrhea and colitis. 
      The use of probiotics for these two related diseases remains controversial.
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD and
      the treatment of CDD based on the published randomized, controlled clinical
      trials. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical
      trials, metaRegister, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
      searched from 1977 to 2005, unrestricted by language. Secondary searches of
      reference lists, authors, reviews, commentaries, associated diseases, books, and 
      meeting abstracts. STUDY SELECTION: Trials were included in which specific
      probiotics given to either prevent or treat the diseases of interest. Trials were
      required to be randomized, controlled, blinded efficacy trials in humans
      published in peer-reviewed journals. Trials that were excluded were pre-clinical,
      safety, Phase 1 studies in volunteers, reviews, duplicate reports, trials of
      unspecified probiotics, trials of prebiotics, not the disease being studied, or
      inconsistent outcome measures. Thirty-one of 180 screened studies (totally 3,164 
      subjects) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer
      identified studies and abstracted data on sample size, population
      characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: From 25 randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), probiotics significantly reduced the relative risk of
      AAD (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.31, 0.58, p < 0.001). From six randomized trials,
      probiotics had significant efficacy for CDD (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41, 0.85, p =
      0.005). CONCLUSION: A variety of different types of probiotics show promise as
      effective therapies for these two diseases. Using meta-analyses, three types of
      probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and probiotic
      mixtures) significantly reduced the development of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Only S. boulardii was effective for CDD.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or 
      in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful
      in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the
      prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the
      maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results
      indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent 
      atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say
      they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend
      probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention
      of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger
      and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative
      and dose-ranging trials.

TI  - Probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 260-3
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of
      probiotics beyond simple antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of 
      action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1)
      competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens; (2)
      immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response; (3) antimicrobial
      activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier activity;
      and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis. The unraveling of these mechanisms of
      action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of
      clinical inflammatory bowel disease. While level 1 evidence now supports the
      therapeutic use of some probiotics in the maintenance treatment of pouchitis,
      only level 2 and 3 evidence are currently available in support of the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged over the course 
      of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic
      effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials, to investigate the
      unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or
      multistrain formulation, and the concomitant use of prebiotics, synbiotics or
      antibiotics, are vital.

TI  - Colonic health: fermentation and short chain fatty acids.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Interest has been recently rekindled in short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with the 
      emergence of prebiotics and probiotics aimed at improving colonic and systemic
      health. Dietary carbohydrates, specifically resistant starches and dietary fiber,
      are substrates for fermentation that produce SCFAs, primarily acetate,
      propionate, and butyrate, as end products. The rate and amount of SCFA production
      depends on the species and amounts of microflora present in the colon, the
      substrate source and gut transit time. SCFAs are readily absorbed. Butyrate is
      the major energy source for colonocytes. Propionate is largely taken up by the
      liver. Acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral 
      tissues. Specific SCFA may reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal
      disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Acetate is the principal SCFA in
      the colon, and after absorption it has been shown to increase cholesterol
      synthesis. However, propionate, a gluconeogenerator, has been shown to inhibit
      cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, substrates that can decrease the acetate:
      propionate ratio may reduce serum lipids and possibly cardiovascular disease
      risk. Butyrate has been studied for its role in nourishing the colonic mucosa and
      in the prevention of cancer of the colon, by promoting cell differentiation,
      cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed colonocytes; inhibiting the enzyme
      histone deacetylase and decreasing the transformation of primary to secondary
      bile acids as a result of colonic acidification. Therefore, a greater increase in
      SCFA production and potentially a greater delivery of SCFA, specifically
      butyrate, to the distal colon may result in a protective effect. Butyrate
      irrigation (enema) has also been suggested in the treatment of colitis. More
      human studies are now needed, especially, given the diverse nature of
      carbohydrate substrates and the SCFA patterns resulting from their fermentation. 
      Short-term and long-term human studies are particularly required on SCFAs in
      relation to markers of cancer risk. These studies will be key to the success of
      dietary recommendations to maximize colonic disease prevention.

TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
PG  - 361-72
AB  - Diarrhoea is a common complication of antimicrobial therapy. The term
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is often considered synonymous with
      Clostridium difficile. In fact, AAD can develop through a variety of mechanisms
      and manifest through a broad range of clinical signs and symptoms. For improved
      prevention and recognition of AAD, it is important to understand the
      pathophysiology and risk factors for AAD. Although Clostridium difficile
      continues to be the most common identifiable pathogen of AAD, many patients with 
      AAD can be managed through a variety of conservative measures. This review
      focuses on some of the important distinctions between nonspecific AAD and
      antibiotic-associated colitis. In addition, the most recent data on important
      risk factors for the development of AAD are summarised. Given its pathogenicity, 
      there will be an emphasis on the early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea. AAD is a common clinical problem that
      can progress to severe, life-threatening disease if not recognised quickly.
      Better awareness of risk factors can lead to the most efficacious treatment of
      this disorder: primary prevention.

TI  - Probiotics: their role in the treatment and prevention of disease.
PG  - 261-75
AB  - A probiotic is a "live microbial food ingredients that, when ingested in
      sufficient quantities, exerts health benefits on the consumer". Probiotics exert 
      their benefits through several mechanisms; they prevent colonization, cellular
      adhesion and invasion by pathogenic organisms, they have direct antimicrobial
      activity and they modulate the host immune response. The strongest evidence for
      the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in their use for the prevention
      of symptoms of lactose intolerance, treatment of acute diarrhea, attenuation of
      antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal side effects and the prevention and
      treatment of allergy manifestations. More research needs to be carried out to
      clarify conflicting findings on the use of probiotics for prevention of
      travelers' diarrhea, infections in children in daycare and dental caries, and
      elimination of nasal colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria. Promising
      ongoing research is being conducted on the use of probiotics for the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile colitis, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection,
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and prevention of relapse, treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome, treatment of intestinal inflammation in cystic fibrosis
      patients, and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
      Finally, areas of future research include the use of probiotics for the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis, prevention of cancer and the treatment of
      graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients.

TI  - Altered levels of biochemical indices of bone turnover and bone-related vitamins 
      in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1007-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteopenia 
      may be related to pathological rates of bone turnover; however, the literature
      shows mixed results. AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel
      disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32,
      separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and
      controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area,
      respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's
      disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding
      supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific
      alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen
      cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively).
      Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by
      20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%,
      respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the
      combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively
      associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.

TI  - Synbiotic therapy: a promising new adjunctive therapy for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 132-8
AB  - Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies being used to treat
      gastrointestinal diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of
      select prebiotics and probiotics, alone or in combination (the latter called
      "synbiotic" therapy) may improve the clinical outcome of patients with ulcerative
      colitis. We report a case of a pediatric ulcerative colitis patient who showed
      increased length of remission, resolution of symptoms, and improved quality of
      life following the administration of synbiotic therapy. The literature supporting
      the use of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic therapies in adult ulcerative
      colitis is also reviewed.

TI  - Probiotics modulate inflammatory cytokine secretion from inflamed mucosa in
      active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 284-8
AB  - Enteric microflora of ulcerative colitis patients becomes aberrant. The abnormal 
      interaction between microflora and intestinal mucosal immune system leads the
      mucosal inflammation. Probiotic administration may recover the commensal
      microflora and normalise the host-microbial interaction. In this experiment, we
      cocultured colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis patients with
      bifidobacterium to investigate the modulation effect of probiotics on inflamed
      colonic tissues and its possible mechanism. Colonic biopsies from active
      ulcerative colitis were cocultured for 24 h with Bifidobacterium longum. Tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in supernatants were measured 
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the biopsies were fixed using paraffin 
      and the expression of NF-kappaB P65 of tissues was studied using
      immunohistochemical staining. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in
      supernatants of tissues cocultured with probiotics were lower than those cultured
      alone. The number of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with nuclear
      factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) P65 positive in cocultured tissues was also decreased.
      When cocultured with inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis, probiotics
      could inhibit NF-kappaB activation in LPMC and down-regulate inflammatory
      cytokine secretion from inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Cutaneous metastasis of Crohn's disease].
PG  - 230-2
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Involvement of the skin in Crohn's disease is rare. We report the
      case of a young woman presenting cutaneous nodules revealing a Crohn's disease.
      CASE REPORT: R. K. a 19 year old woman was admitted the impatient clinic for a 2 
      week history of nodular lesions of the extremities. Simultaneously, she had
      watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain associated with a bad general condition and
      fever. Skin examination showed ulcerated lesions with a non infiltrated
      inflammatory bader of the left food and the right calf associated with an abscess
      of the left forearm. Skin biopsy showed an inflammatory infiltrate of the deep
      dermis with tuberculoid noncaseating granulomas. Colonoscopy demonstrated
      multiple ulcers, a "globlestone appearance" of the glow and segmental glitis.
      Colonoscopy was followed by a peritonitis which made steroid therapy
      questionable. Meanwhile, the patient underwent a colonostomy and was fed
      intravenously, the skin lesions resolved. A follow up colonoscopy demonstrated
      colon polyps, and the biopsy of the colon showed features of colitis and
      "follicular" duodenitis which was in concordance with the diagnosis of Crohn's
      disease. COMMENTARIES: Usually, cutaneous lesions in Crohn's disease are
      consistent with nodules and granulomatous fissures of the grain. Involvement of
      the mucosa is rare. We report the case of "metastatic" localisation of nodular
      abscesses in Corhn disease. Improvement of cutaneous lesions might be explained
      by the nonuse of the digestive track allowed by the parenteral supplementation.

TI  - Subjective improvement in patients with psoriatic arthritis after short-term oral
      treatment with seal oil. A pilot study with double blind comparison to soy oil.
PG  - 307-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of short-term oral treatment with seal oil in
      patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: Forty-three patients with
      polyarticular PsA were randomized to receive oral treatment for 2 weeks with
      either seal oil or soy oil in a double blind controlled trial. Clinical and
      biochemical variables were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and 4 weeks
      post-treatment. Patients were allowed to continue nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAID) and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) during the study.
      RESULTS: Forty patients completed the study, 20 in each treatment group. Patients
      in the seal oil group reported a significant improvement in global assessment of 
      the disease 4 weeks post- treatment (p < 0.01), and both groups showed a trend
      toward improvement in tender joint count, but the differences between the groups 
      were not significant. There was a fall in the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids and
      in arachidonic acid (AA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in serum after treatment 
      with seal oil (p < 0.01). Twenty-one percent of all patients had elevated values 
      of calprotectin in feces suggestive of asymptomatic colitis. CONCLUSION:
      Treatment with seal oil was followed by a modest improvement in patient's global 
      assessment of the disease and a trend towards a decrease in number of tender
      joints. There was a shift in fatty acid composition in serum toward a putative
      antiinflammatory profile. Oral treatment with seal oil may have NSAID-like
      effects in PsA.

TI  - Relationship between nutritional habits adopted by ulcerative colitis relevant to
      cancer development patients at clinical remission stages and molecular-genetic
      parameters.
PG  - 188-95
AB  - UC (ulcerative colitis) patients have an increased risk of developing colorectal 
      cancer compared with the normal population. The cause underlying this higher risk
      is not fully defined but includes nutritional and environmental factors
      concomitant with genetic alterations. We aimed to evaluate genetic stability in
      the colonic tissue of UC patients in clinical remission compared with the healthy
      population, and to establish a possible correlation between nutritional habits
      and these molecular assessments. UC patients (n 42) and healthy controls (n 37)
      participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and
      medically diagnosed. Participants completed five separate 7 d dietary records,
      food-frequency questionnaires and validated 24 h recalls for nutritional
      assessment. The extent of chromosome 17 loss and the calculated chromosome index 
      was determined in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
      Correlations between the molecular and nutritional assessments were performed
      using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Significant differences in the
      nutritional intake of total fat (65 (SD 15) v. 89 (SD 25) g), cholesterol (330
      (SD 168) v. 464 (SD 177) mg), dietary fibre (32 (SD 4.7) v. 9 (SD 4) g), vitamin 
      A (1009 (SD 209) v. 506 (SD 204) microg), vitamin C (308 (SD 108) v. 72 (SD 53)
      mg) and folic acid (412 (SD 89 microg) v. 187 (SD 107)) were recorded for UC
      patients compared with controls. Significant correlations were found for the
      consumption of different food groups and the chromosome index for chromosome 17. 
      The results of our study suggest that the nutritional habits adopted by UC
      patients during clinical remission may affect key cellular components of the
      colonic tissue, inducing a high degree of aneuploidy and genetic instability, and
      probably affecting the development of colon cancer.

TI  - Effect of fish oil enriched enteral diet on inflammatory bowel disease tissues in
      organ culture: differential effects on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 7466-72
AB  - AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal
      tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed
      non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients
      with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control
      patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with
      Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK)
      modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture
      system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium
      alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining 
      for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of
      inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control
      were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected
      tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased
      IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1;
      26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected
      tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 
      69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control
      10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase
      the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control
      (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average
      percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was
      significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8
      vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly
      higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its
      fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta
      cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly
      more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of
      IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of 
      elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary
      treatment of UC may be possible.

TI  - Bacterial and fungal microbiota in relation to probiotic therapy (VSL#3) in
      pouchitis.
PG  - 833-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in the
      pathophysiology of pouchitis, a major complication after ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Recently, controlled trials have
      demonstrated that probiotics are effective in maintenance of remission in
      pouchitis patients. However, the mechanism by which therapy with probiotics works
      remains elusive. This study explores the role of the bacterial and fungal flora
      in a controlled trial for maintenance of remission in pouchitis patients with the
      probiotic VSL#3 compound. METHODS: The mucosa associated pouch microbiota was
      investigated before and after therapy with VSL#3 by analysis of endoscopic
      biopsies using ribosomal DNA/RNA based community fingerprint analysis, clone
      libraries, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescence in situ
      hybridisation. Patients were recruited from a placebo controlled remission
      maintenance trial with VSL#3. RESULTS: Patients who developed pouchitis while
      treated with placebo had low bacterial and high fungal diversity. Bacterial
      diversity was increased and fungal diversity was reduced in patients in remission
      maintained with VSL#3 (p = 0.001). Real time PCR experiments demonstrated that
      VSL#3 increased the total number of bacterial cells (p = 0.002) and modified the 
      spectrum of bacteria towards anaerobic species. Taxa specific clone libraries for
      Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria showed that the richness and spectrum of these
      bacteria were altered under probiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic therapy
      with VSL#3 increases the total number of intestinal bacterial cells as well as
      the richness and diversity of the bacterial microbiota, especially the anaerobic 
      flora. The diversity of the fungal flora is repressed. Restoration of the
      integrity of a "protective" intestinal mucosa related microbiota could therefore 
      be a potential mechanism of probiotic bacteria in inflammatory barrier diseases
      of the lower gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus casei on Shigella-infected human
      intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 1228-37
AB  - Shigella invades the human intestinal mucosa, thus causing bacillary dysentery,
      an acute recto-colitis responsible for lethal complications, mostly in infants
      and toddlers. Conversely, commensal bacteria live in a mutualistic relationship
      with the intestinal mucosa that is characterized by homeostatic control of innate
      responses, thereby contributing to tolerance to the flora. Cross-talk established
      between commensals and the intestinal epithelium mediate this active process, the
      mechanisms of which remain largely uncharacterized. Probiotics such as
      Lactobacillus casei belong to a subclass of these commensals that modulate
      mucosal innate responses and possibly display anti-inflammatory properties. We
      analyzed whether L. casei could attenuate the pro-inflammatory signaling induced 
      by Shigella flexneri after invasion of the epithelial lining. Cultured epithelial
      cells were infected with L. casei, followed by a challenge with S. flexneri.
      Using macroarray DNA chips, we observed that L. casei down-regulated the
      transcription of a number of genes encoding pro-inflammatory effectors such as
      cytokines and chemokines and adherence molecules induced by invasive S. flexneri.
      This resulted in an anti-inflammatory effect that appeared mediated by the
      inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway, particularly through stabilization of
      I-kappaBalpha. In a time-course experiment using GeneChip hybridization analysis,
      the expression of many genes involved in ubiquitination and proteasome processes 
      were modulated during L. casei treatment. Thus, L. casei has developed a
      sophisticated means to maintain intestinal homeostasis through a process that
      involves manipulation of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway upstream of
      I-kappaBalpha.

TI  - Combined use of noninvasive tests is useful in the initial diagnostic approach to
      a child with suspected inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the combined use of fecal calprotectin 
      (FC), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), perinuclear staining
      antineutrophil antibody (pANCA), small intestinal permeability test (IP), and
      bowel wall ultrasonography measurement (BWUS) in the diagnostic work-up of
      children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: All children
      referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with
      symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) 
      mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients
      underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation
      including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, 
      FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. RESULTS: 
      A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10
      ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8
      functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious
      enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous
      abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having 
      IBD was 99.47%. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0.69% of
      probability of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic
      tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive
      procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in
      children is initially uncertain.

TI  - Probiotics. Some evidence of their effectiveness.
PG  - 1487-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the term probiotics, to indicate how to identify products
      that have been proven beneficial, and to assess the quality of evidence regarding
      probiotics. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A few level I studies support the effectiveness 
      of specific probiotics for certain diagnoses. For most so-called probiotics,
      however, weak or no evidence supports their effectiveness. MAIN MESSAGE:
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer a health benefit on the host. Level I evidence supports use of VSL#3 for
      maintaining remission of inflammatory colitis. Probiotics for treating vaginal
      infections, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, have
      level I evidence of effectiveness, but are not available in Canada. Specific
      probiotics taken for certain indications improve health and have few side
      effects. CONCLUSION: Limited but good evidence supports the role of certain
      probiotics in medical practice. Because consumer pressure will undoubtedly
      stimulate further interest in probiotics, family doctors need to be informed
      about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.

TI  - Cow milk is not responsible for most gastrointestinal immune-like
      syndromes--evidence from a population-based study.
PG  - 1327-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal hypersensitivity to cow milk (CM) may be more common
      among school-aged children and young adults than previously thought. OBJECTIVE:
      The objective was to study various gastrointestinal complaints and the
      immunologic mechanisms associated with food-related, especially CM-related,
      gastrointestinal disorders in young adults. DESIGN: Of 827 subjects aged 16-21 y 
      who completed a questionnaire on food-related gastrointestinal symptoms, 49
      symptomatic subjects agreed to a clinical examination, including an interview,
      blood tests, a lactose-maldigestion test, a blinded CM challenge and, in severely
      symptomatic subjects (n = 12), an endoscopic examination. Twenty-nine subjects
      served as controls. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of the subjects reported having
      major gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly food-related (n = 70 of 86), during the
      preceding year. Specific organic disease was found in 2 symptomatic subjects: 1
      case of celiac disease and 1 of colitis. The result of the lactose-maldigestion
      test was positive in 16 of the remaining 47 symptomatic subjects, but only 4
      carried the C/C(-13910) genotype for adult-type hypolactasia. The symptomatic
      subjects had restricted their consumption of certain foods, particularly CM.
      However, in a blinded challenge, CM-induced symptoms were rare. The symptomatic
      subjects had higher plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (P = 0.007) 
      and lower granzyme A (P = 0.001) concentrations than did the control subjects.
      Duodenal biopsy samples tended to have higher intraepithelial CD3(+) cell counts 
      (P = 0.065) and a higher expression of transforming growth factor beta (P =
      0.073) and interleukin 12p35 messenger RNA (P = 0.075) than did the control
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected cohort of young adults, 8% reported
      food-related gastrointestinal symptoms. The finding of immunologic activity
      implied the existence of a food-related gastrointestinal syndrome but not one
      induced by CM.

      Thus far only infliximab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      as induction and maintenance treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease
      (moderate-to-severe and/or fistulizing) who are refractory to conventional
      therapy. Recent data from two large multicenter, multicountry, randomized
      controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that infliximab is efficacious also 
      for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Other biologics considered potentially
      efficacious are still undergoing evaluation in various clinical trials. SUMMARY: 
      The data concerning biologics' associated toxicity in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease are the most robust in the case of infliximab. These data are
      derived from both prospective, randomized clinical trials and from post-marketing
      experience. In the case of the remaining agents the data concerning safety in
      inflammatory bowel disease are limited, as these agents were not evaluated in as 
      many trials as infliximab; indeed, some of them included only several patients.

AB  - Traditional medications for inflammatory bowel disease are small molecule drugs, 
      most of which were developed for use in other diseases before being found to be
      efficacious for the treatment of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Recently,
      several exciting alternative approaches to the medical treatment of inflammatory 
      bowel disease have been developed. These include biologic, probiotic, and
      apheresis therapies that offer certain advantages over traditional drug therapy
      for inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to assess the
      current state of knowledge about novel biologic, probiotic, and apheresis
      therapies and to analyze how best to incorporate these therapies into evolving
      management paradigms of inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - 475-84
AB  - Advances (from 2004 to 2006) in the use of conventional agents include the
      molecular mechanisms of action, which have implications for monitoring
      (azathioprine and thioguanosine triphosphate) and chemoprevention (mesalamine and
      peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma). Advances in biotherapy include
      new data on monoclonal antibodies (infliximab in ulcerative colitis, adalimumab, 
      certolizumab pegol, fontolizumab, selective anti-adhesion molecules, and others),
      antisense oligonucleotides, the development of small molecules, and cell-gene
      therapy (including helminth ova, leukocytapheresis, stem cell transplantation,
      and probiotic intestinal mucosal delivery systems). However, management of
      inflammatory bowel disease is about more than drug therapy, dose, and timing. The
      goals remain induction of remission, limitation of side effects, modification of 
      the pattern of disease, and avoidance of complications. With the cost and
      complexity of biotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease is emerging as a specific
      subspecialty.

TI  - Immunomodulatory and therapeutic properties of the Nigella sativa L. seed.
PG  - 1749-70
AB  - A larger number of medicinal plants and their purified constituents have been
      shown beneficial therapeutic potentials. Seeds of Nigella sativa, a dicotyledon
      of the Ranunculaceae family, have been employed for thousands of years as a spice
      and food preservative. The oil and seed constituents, in particular thymoquinine 
      (TQ), have shown potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine. In view 
      of the recent literature, this article lists and discusses different
      immunomodulatory and immunotherapeutic potentials for the crude oil of N. sativa 
      seeds and its active ingredients. The published findings provide clear evidence
      that both the oil and its active ingredients, in particular TQ, possess
      reproducible anti-oxidant effects through enhancing the oxidant scavenger system,
      which as a consequence lead to antitoxic effects induced by several insults. The 
      oil and TQ have shown also potent anti-inflammatory effects on several
      inflammation-based models including experimental encephalomyelitis, colitis,
      peritonitis, oedama, and arthritis through suppression of the inflammatory
      mediators prostaglandins and leukotriens. The oil and certain active ingredients 
      showed beneficial immunomodulatory properties, augmenting the T cell- and natural
      killer cell-mediated immune responses. Most importantly, both the oil and its
      active ingredients expressed anti-microbial and anti-tumor properties toward
      different microbes and cancers. Coupling these beneficial effects with its use in
      folk medicine, N. sativa seed is a promising source for active ingredients that
      would be with potential therapeutic modalities in different clinical settings.
      The efficacy of the active ingredients, however, should be measured by the nature
      of the disease. Given their potent immunomodulatory effects, further studies are 
      urgently required to explore bystander effects of TQ on the professional antigen 
      presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as its
      modulatory effects upon Th1- and Th2-mediated inflammatory immune diseases.
      Ultimately, results emerging from such studies will substantially improve the
      immunotherapeutic application of TQ in clinical settings.

      O157:H7/H-using SYBR Green I in a real-time multiplex PCR.
PG  - 31-41
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a major foodborne pathogen capable
      of causing diarrhea and vomiting, but more serious complications such as
      hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) can result. A real-time
      PCR method to detect the presence of Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) and E. 
      coli O157:H7 was investigated using SYBR Green I (SG). Primers were designed to
      target the Shiga toxin genes (stx1 and stx2) and a highly conserved base
      substitution at +93 of the beta-glucuronidase gene (uidA) unique to E. coli
      O157:H7. An initial test panel of five E. coli and non-E. coli isolates was
      tested with individual primer sets (simplex assay) and all primer sets including 
      stx1, stx2, and uidA (multiplex assay). All strains were correctly identified in 
      both assays. Average melt temperatures (Tm's, degrees C) for PCR products were
      85.42--stx1, 81.93--stx2, and 88.25--uidA in simplex assays and 85.20--stx1,
      81.20--stx2, and 88.16--uidA when multiplexed. Each of the three gene targets in 
      one multiplex reaction could be distinguished by melt curve data with
      significantly different Tm's. The assay was expanded to a panel of 138 isolates
      consisting of STEC, E. coli O157:H7, non-toxigenic E. coli, and non-E. coli
      isolates with melt peaks consistent with those stated above.

TI  - Probiotics in arthralgia and spondyloarthropathies in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease. Prospective randomized trials are necessary.
PG  - 570-4
AB  - Arthralgias and spondyloarthropathies of the peripheral and axial joints are
      common in inflammatory bowel disease. Evidence for a strong association between
      these clinical manifestations and diseases of the joints has been provided by
      several clinical and epidemiological studies. Immunological studies have shown
      the presence of shared inflammatory cells both in the gut and the synovium in
      spondyloarthropathies. Genetic factors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
      spondyloarthropathies and inflammatory bowel disease. The role of the ubiquitous 
      bacterial flora and pathogenic microorganisms present in the intestinal lumen may
      induce these joint diseases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this 
      review we will focus on the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies and arthralgia 
      in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. Based on preliminary
      clinical observations in patients with arthralgia and IBD, we put forward the
      hypothesis that probiotics may be helpful in the management of common
      extraintestinal manifestations such as arthralgia in patients with ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Allergic colitis presenting within the first hours of premature life.
PG  - 1514-5
AB  - UNLABELLED: A prematurely born infant developed rectal blood loss several hours
      after birth, after his first formula feeding. Discontinuing the feeding resolved 
      symptoms, but after resuming feeding rectal blood loss reappeared. There were no 
      signs of necrotizing enterocolitis. Suspecting cow's milk allergy, the feeding
      was changed to a casein-based protein hydrolysate, without effect. Meanwhile,
      laboratory tests indicated cow's milk allergy. Symptoms only resolved after
      introducing an amino acid-based formula supporting a definite diagnosis of cow's 
      milk-induced allergic colitis. This is the first description of a premature
      infant with symptoms of allergic colitis, appearing within hours after birth,
      suggestive of intrauterine sensitization. The exact mechanisms of sensitization
      remain obscure. CONCLUSION: Cow's milk-induced allergic colitis can occur after
      the first feed, even in a prematurely born neonate. This is most probably due to 
      intrauterine sensitization, and should be included in the differential diagnosis 
      of rectal blood loss.

TI  - Significance of salicylate intolerance in diseases of the lower gastrointestinal 
      tract.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced
      pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an
      organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or
      inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or
      life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local
      disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the
      characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of
      gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University.
      On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of
      chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID
      intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to
      clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.)
      including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory
      bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When
      presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these 
      symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility
      of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic,
      diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.

TI  - Prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in beef cattle.
PG  - 2224-41
AB  - A large number of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains have
      caused major outbreaks and sporadic cases of human illnesses, including mild
      diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the life-threatening
      hemolytic uremic syndrome. These illnesses have been traced to both O157 and
      non-O157 STEC. In a large number of STEC-associated outbreaks, the infections
      were attributed to consumption of ground beef or other beef products contaminated
      with cattle feces. Thus, beef cattle are considered reservoirs of STEC and can
      pose significant health risks to humans. The global nature of the human food
      supply suggests that safety concerns with beef will continue and the challenges
      facing the beef industry will increase at the production and processing levels.
      To be prepared to address these concerns and challenges, it is critical to assess
      the role of beef cattle in human STEC infections. In this review, published
      reports on STEC in beef cattle were evaluated to achieve the following specific
      objectives: (i) assess the prevalence of STEC in beef cattle, and (ii) determine 
      the potential health risks of STEC strains from beef cattle. The latter objective
      is critically important because many beef STEC isolates are highly virulent.
      Global testing of beef cattle feces revealed wide ranges of prevalence rates for 
      O157 STEC (i.e., 0.2 to 27.8%) and non-O157 STEC (i.e., 2.1 to 70.1%). Of the 261
      STEC serotypes found in beef cattle, 44 cause hemolytic uremic syndrome and 37
      cause other illnesses.

TI  - Curcumin therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 2191-3
AB  - Curcumin, a natural compound used as a food additive, has been shown to have
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in cell culture and animal studies. 
      A pure curcumin preparation was administered in an open label study to five
      patients with ulcerative proctitis and five with Crohn's disease. All proctitis
      patients improved, with reductions in concomitant medications in four, and four
      of five Crohn's disease patients had lowered CDAI scores and sedimentation rates.
      This encouraging pilot study suggests the need for double-blind
      placebo-controlled follow-up studies.

TI  - Eosinophils alter colonic epithelial barrier function: role for major basic
      protein.
PG  - G890-7
AB  - Mucosal eosinophils increase in a number of gastrointestinal diseases that are
      often associated with altered epithelial barrier function, including food
      allergic enteropathies and inflammatory bowel diseases. Although eosinophils are 
      known to secrete biologically active mediators including granule proteins, their 
      role in gastrointestinal diseases is uncertain. The aim of this study was to
      determine the impact of eosinophils on intestinal barrier function. Epithelial
      barrier function was determined in a coculture of eosinophils and T84 epithelial 
      cells and in a murine model of T helper (Th) type 2-mediated colitis. Coculture
      conditions resulted in decreased transepithelial resistance (TER) and increased
      transepithelial flux. Cell-free coculture supernatants contained a > or =5-kDa
      soluble factor that also diminished TER; these supernatants contained the
      eosinophil-granule proteins major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil-derived
      neurotoxin (EDN). T84 barrier function decreased significantly when basolateral
      surfaces were exposed to native human MBP but not EDN. Additional studies
      identified downregulation of the tight junctional molecule occludin as at least
      one mechanism for MBP action. MBP-null mice were protected from inflammation
      associated with oxazolone colitis compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion,
      MBP decreases epithelial barrier function and in this manner contributes to the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Bifidogenic growth stimulator for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 76-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in
      chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders. Bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) is
      a prebiotic preparation produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii isolated
      from Swiss cheese. Previously BGS was shown to act in the colon as a growth
      stimulator of Bifidobacteria. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of 
      BGS in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twelve patients with mildly 
      to moderately active ulcerative colitis received orally 4.5 g of BGS daily for 4 
      wk in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory
      therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and
      endoscopically. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and the composition of 
      commensal bacteria, including Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria and Bacteroides
      species, were studied in stool samples. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in
      their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score
      from 7.4 +/- 2.8 to 4.7 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- standard error of the mean, P < 0.01). 
      The endoscopic index score decreased from 4.4 +/- 1.7 to 2.8 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05)
      with treatment. Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations
      after BGS treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in stool levels
      of bacteria as a result of BGS treatment. No side effects related to BGS were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral BGS therapy may represent a non-toxic way to treat
      ulcerative colitis. However, controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its
      efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Vaccine prospects for amebiasis.
PG  - 657-68
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is a eukaryotic protozoan parasite and is the causative
      agent of amebic colitis and amebic liver abscess. Many insights into the innate
      and acquired immune responses to infection with E. histolytica have been made in 
      recent years. These findings have provided a foundation for producing a vaccine
      that could help to prevent the initial establishment of infection in the
      intestinal wall. The galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin on
      the surface of the ameba is an immunodominant molecule that is highly conserved
      and has an integral role in the stimulation of these immune responses. The
      structure of the lectin has been defined, and the heavy subunit with its
      cysteine-rich region has been demonstrated in animal models to have some efficacy
      as a possible vaccine agent for prevention of amebic infection. Finding an ideal 
      animal model of amebic intestinal infection has been difficult, but the C3H mouse
      and severe combined immunodeficient mouse-human intestinal xenograft models have 
      both provided valuable insights into the first line of immune defense at the
      mucosal wall of the colon. Providing safe food and water to all people in the
      developing world is a formidable task that is not achievable in the foreseeable
      future. However, a vaccine for amebiasis could make a significant impact on the
      morbidity and mortality from the disease. Many components of the ameba are
      immunogenic and may serve as targets for a future vaccine, including the
      galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine lectin, the serine-rich E. histolytica
      protein, cysteine proteinases, lipophosphoglycans, amebapores and the 29-kDa
      protein.

TI  - Correlation of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius growth phase with its cell
      wall-associated proteome.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 is a probiotic bacterium that
      was originally isolated from human intestinal tissues and was subsequently shown 
      in a pilot study to alleviate symptoms associated with mild-moderate Crohn's
      disease. Strain UCC118 can adhere to animal and human intestinal tissue, and to
      both healthy and inflamed ulcerative colitis mucosa, irrespective of location in 
      the gut. In this study, an enzymatic technique has been combined with proteomic
      analysis to correlate bacterial growth phase with the presence of factors present
      in the cell wall of the bacterium. Using PAGE electrophoresis, it was determined 
      that progression from lag to log to stationary growth phases in vitro correlated 
      with increasing prominence of an 84kD protein associated with in vitro adherence 
      ability. Isolated proteins from the 84kD band region were further separated by
      two-dimensional electrophoresis, resolving this band into 20 individual protein
      spots at differing isoelectric points. The protein moieties were excised, trypsin
      digested and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. The observed proteins are
      analogous to those reported to be associated with the Listeria monocytogenes
      cell-wall proteome, and include DnaK, Ef-Ts and pyruvate kinase. These data
      suggest that at least some of the beneficial attributes of probiotic
      lactobacilli, and in particular this strain, may be due to nonpathogenic mimicry 
      of pathogens and potentially be mediated through a form of attenuated virulence.

TI  - Interleukin-1beta targets interleukin-6 in progressing dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced experimental colitis.
PG  - 647-54
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immunologically mediated disorder that is 
      characterized by chronic, relapsing, and inflammatory responses. Dextran sulfate 
      sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice has been recognized as a useful
      model for human IBD and interleukin (IL)-1beta is a key cytokine in the onset of 
      IBD. The purpose of the present study was to clarify which pro-inflammatory
      mediators are targeted by IL-1beta in mice with DSS-induced colitis. First, we
      found that DSS markedly induced IL-1beta production in both dose- and
      time-dependent manners (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) in murine peritoneal
      macrophages (pMphi), while that of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was insignificant.
      Further, the expressions of mRNA and protein for IL-1beta were increased in
      colonic mucosa and pMphi from mice that received drinking water containing 5% DSS
      for 7 days (P < 0.01, each). In addition, the expressions of IL-6, granulocyte
      macrophage-colony stimulating factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and
      cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA were also time dependently increased (P < 0.01, each).
      Furthermore, administration of rIL-1beta (10 microg/kg, i.p.) significantly
      induced the expressions of IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA in colonic mucosa from
      non-treated mice (P < 0.01). Anti-mIL-1beta antibody treatments (50 microg/kg,
      i.p.) attenuated DSS-induced body weight reduction and shortening of the
      colorectum (P < 0.05, each), and abrogated the expressions of IL-1beta and IL-6
      mRNA in colonic mucosa (P < 0.01, each). Our results evidently support the
      previous findings that IL-1beta is involved in the development of DSS-induced
      experimental colitis in mice, and strongly suggest that IL-1beta targets itself
      and IL-6 for progressing colonic inflammation.

TI  - Probiotics (VSL#3) in arthralgia in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's 
      disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 453-9
AB  - Arthralgia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Alterations of the immunologic regulation in the gut may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of arthralgia. Probiotics (VSL#3) have proven
      effective in the treatment of pouchitis in patients with ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis after panproctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis both in maintaining
      remission and in preventing a flare-up without side effects. The aim of this
      study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSL#3 in patients with
      quiescent IBD who suffered from arthralgia for more than two weeks. An open-label
      trial was conducted using VSL#3. Pre- and post-treatment joint pain intensity
      were measured on the Ritchie Articular Index and visual analog scale. Disease
      activity of the bowel was assessed by the Truelove-Witts and the Harvey-Bradshaw 
      scores. Sixteen of 29 patients completed the trial; in 10 of the 16 patients a
      statistically significant improvement was documented by the Ritchie Articular
      Index. No one of the patients had a relapse of intestinal disease while on
      probiotics. These preliminary results suggest that the probiotic mixture VSL#3
      may be an alternative treatment for arthralgia in patients with IBD without
      inducing exacerbation of the disease. Because probiotics may be effective in the 
      treatment of IBD as well, our results suggest that patients with active disease
      and arthralgia may also derive benefit from this treatment. Proper randomized
      controlled studies are indicated.

TI  - Occurrence of virulence factors among human intestinal enterococcal isolates.
PG  - 341-4
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of enterococcal
      virulence factors among human intestinal Enterococcus faecalis strains and to
      find out whether the pattern differs from that seen in published reports on food 
      and clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: The E. faecalis isolates were
      cultured from human faecal samples obtained from five ulcerative colitis patients
      in remission phase. The species identification was based on API120 strips and
      species-specific PCR primers. The isolates were further characterized using the
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The presence of seven different known
      enterococcal virulence factors among the confirmed E. faecalis isolates were
      screened using PCR techniques and published primers. CONCLUSIONS: Among the 35
      isolates representing nine different pulsotypes the most frequent virulence
      factors were cpd (33 isolates), agg (25 isolates), gelE (22 isolates) and esp (15
      isolates). No complete sets of genes associated for the production of functional 
      cytolysin were encountered indicating that intestinal enterococci may differ in
      this respect from clinical strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:
      According to the results, the commensal enterococcal strains appear to differ
      from clinical isolates in their complement of presumed virulence factors.

TI  - The use of medications for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy and
      nursing.
PG  - 1833-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease includes two primary disorders, ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. These diseases mainly affect young adults, with a peak
      occurrence between 15 and 25 years of age. The causes of these diseases are
      largely unknown, with current treatments targeted against the heightened
      inflammatory response witnessed in the intestinal mucosa of both conditions. With
      the peak age ranges for pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease overlapping, it 
      is important to weigh the benefits of treating a mother during pregnancy against 
      the potential risks to the fetus and the course of the pregnancy. This review
      examines the current safety data on medications used in women with inflammatory
      bowel disease during pregnancy.

TI  - A pilot randomised controlled trial to reduce colorectal cancer risk markers
      associated with B-vitamin deficiency, insulin resistance and colonic
      inflammation.
PG  - 639-46
AB  - Colorectal cancer risk is associated with biochemical markers for B-vitamin
      deficiency, insulin resistance and colonic inflammation, suggesting that these
      three conditions are each involved in colon carcinogenesis. We expected that
      dietary supplements of folic acid, n-3 fatty acids and calcium would reduce the
      markers and thus possibly cancer risk. We therefore randomised 98 participants,
      with previous colonic polyps or intramucosal carcinomas, to a combined treatment 
      of supplementary folic acid, fish oil and calcium carbonate, or placebos for 28
      days. Blood and faecal samples were obtained prior to and at the conclusion of
      the intervention and analysed for plasma folate, homocysteine, insulin, free
      fatty acids, triglycerides and faecal calprotectin. In addition, plasma vitamin
      B12, thiamin, glucose and C-reactive protein were assessed. Our supplemental
      strategy modestly affected some of the biomarkers associated with folate
      metabolism and insulin resistance, but had no effect on those associated with
      colonic inflammation. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and
      practicality of clinical trials aimed at reducing diet-related biochemical risk
      markers for colon cancer. We suggest that long-term intervention studies with
      tumour-related end points should be undertaken when the intervention agents used 
      are found effective in short-term biochemical risk marker trials.

TI  - Involvement of innate immunity in the development of inflammatory and autoimmune 
      diseases.
PG  - 787-98
AB  - Initial events and effector mechanisms of most inflammatory and autoimmune
      diseases remain largely unknown. Dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune
      systems associated with mucosae (the major interface between the organism and its
      environment, e.g., microbiota, food) can conceivably cause impairment of mucosal 
      barrier function and development of localized or systemic inflammatory and
      autoimmune processes. Animal models help in elucidating the etiology and
      pathogenetic mechanisms of human diseases, such as the inflammatory bowel
      diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, severe chronic diseases
      affecting the gut. To study the role of innate immunity and gut microbiota in
      intestinal inflammation, colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in
      mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Conventionally reared
      (microflora-colonized) SCID mice displayed severe inflammation like that seen in 
      immunocompetent Balb/c mice, whereas only minor changes appeared in the
      intestinal mucosa of DSS-fed gnotobiotic germ-free SCID mice. The presence of
      microflora facilitates the inflammation in DSS-induced colitis that develops in
      immunodeficient SCID mice, that is, in the absence of T and B lymphocytes. Celiac
      disease, a chronic autoimmune small bowel disorder, afflicts genetically
      susceptible individuals with wheat gluten intolerance. We showed that, in
      contrast with any other food proteins, wheat gliadin and its peptic fragments
      activate mouse macrophages and human monocytes to produce proinflammatory
      cytokines through the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway. Activation of
      innate immunity cells by food proteins or components from gut microbiota thus
      could participate in the impairment of intestinal mucosa and the development of
      intestinal and/or systemic inflammation.

TI  - Prescript-Assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: a
      methodologically oriented, 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      clinical study.
PG  - 755-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The symptomatic efficacy of Prescript-Assist (Safer Medical, Inc.,
      Fort Benton, Montana), a treatment combining probiotic and prebiotic components, 
      has previously been evaluated clinically only in an open-label study in patients 
      with various gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted primarily to compare the effects of
      Prescript-Assist with placebo in patients with a diagnosis of IBS. Toward this
      objective, a secondary methodologic goal was to determine the number and nature
      of symptom clusters ("subsyndromic factors") that characterize IBS. METHODS: This
      was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in which patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either Prescript-Assist one 500-mg capsule BID or 1 
      placebo capsule BID for 2 weeks. Thirteen IBS symptoms identified from the
      clinical literature were embedded in a larger research instrument. Using a scale 
      from 0 to 5, patients rated the intensity of these symptoms for the 7-day period 
      immediately before the start of treatment, at the end of each study week, and
      after each of the 2 subsequent weeks (during which all patients received
      open-label Prescript-Assist as part of a larger study evaluating methodologic
      approaches to enhancing assessments of medication efficacy/safety). The
      symptom-intensity data were subjected to maximum likelihood factor analysis with 
      varimax rotation to identify any IBS subsyndromic factors, and the effect of
      treatment on each of the identified factors was evaluated using analyses of
      covariance with appropriate baseline-week assessments as covariate controls.
      RESULTS: The study included 25 patients with IBS (23 women, 2 men; age range,
      20-70 years). Three subsyndromic factors were identified that together accounted 
      for 60.2% of total IBS symptom variance: factor 1, general ill feelings/nausea;
      factor 2, indigestion/flatulence; and factor 3, colitis. Treatment with
      Prescript-Assist was associated with significant reductions in each of the
      subsyndromic factors. Factor 1 was significantly reduced by 0.345 standard score 
      units (F(1,46) = 4.26; P = 0.042), factor 2 by 0.544 standard score units
      (F(1,46) = 7.83; P = 0.008), and factor 3 by 0.826 standard score units (F(1,46) 
      = 10.20; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 3 subsyndromic factors of
      IBS: general ill feelings/nausea, indigestion/flatulence, and colitis. In this
      methodologically oriented double-blind study in patients with IBS, combined
      probiotic-prebiotic treatment with Prescript-Assist was associated with
      significant reductions in these factors.

AB  - Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) are nowadays among the most important
      emerging group of food-borne pathogens (VTEC strains cause gastroenteritis that
      can be complicated by the hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome, HUS).
      Escherichia coli 026 producing verotoxin 2 was isolated and its identity
      confirmed by examination of phenotype and genotype; the strain was first
      described in Slovakia in association with the development of HUS in a 4-year-old 
      girl.

TI  - Use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
PG  - 1244-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold
      increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major
      risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states.
      Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary 
      oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat
      malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by 
      jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4),
      dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic
      pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients
      received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL
      Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections
      were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate
      excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate
      excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P <
      0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased
      slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment.
      Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium
      oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease
      in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical
      significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can
      influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels.
      These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further
      studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

TI  - Glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1302-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest 
      that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a
      conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma 
      concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may
      improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption
      are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute
      exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled
      for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a
      standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with
      1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN
      with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg
      L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and
      intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio.
      RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group
      throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either
      with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05
      (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and
      nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital
      stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+
      group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention.
      CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the
      hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical
      benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Crohn's disease: the cold chain hypothesis.
PG  - 399-401
AB  - A recent published hypothesis proposed that Crohn's disease was provoked by
      infantile exposure to micro-organisms that can survive refrigerator temperature. 
      A case-control study was accordingly devised. The mean age at first fridge was
      5.6 years amongst 88 patients with Crohn's disease, 5.5 years in 88 patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and 7.6 years in 88 controls, but a majority of
      individuals had always been exposed to refrigerated food. Differences were more
      striking in subjects aged above the median (10.3, 10.9 and 15.0 years for Crohn's
      disease, UC and controls, respectively). This support for the hypothesis reached 
      statistical significance for those with Crohn's disease compared to the controls 
      (p=0.045).

TI  - Etiology of Crohn's disease: Do certain food additives cause intestinal
      inflammation by molecular mimicry of mycobacterial lipids?
PG  - 859-64
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal
      tract which was first described in the beginning of the 20th century. The
      histological similarity with intestinal tuberculosis has led to the assumption of
      an involvement of mycobacteria and mycobacterial antigens, respectively, in the
      etiology. A major defense mechanism against mycobacterial lipid antigens is the
      CD1 system which includes CD1 molecules for antigen presentation and natural
      killer T cells for recognition and subsequent production of cytokines like
      interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. These cytokines promote
      granulomatous transformation. Various food additives, especially emulsifiants,
      thickeners, surface-finishing agents and contaminants like plasticizers share
      structural domains with mycobacterial lipids. It is therefore hypothesized, that 
      these compounds are able to stimulate by molecular mimicry the CD1 system in the 
      gastrointestinal mucosa and to trigger the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade. The
      understanding of Crohn's disease as a CD1-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity 
      to certain food additives would lead to strong emphasis on a dietary treatment.
      Related aspects of pathology, physiology and epidemiology of Crohn's disease are 
      presented.

PG  - 318-25
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

TI  - Update in medical therapy of ulcerative colitis: newer concepts and therapies.
PG  - 557-69
AB  - Recent advances in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis recognize the interface
      of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (eg, gut microflora), and an
      altered host's immune response. The meteoric evolution of new therapies designed 
      to address these pathogenetic factors may lead to confusing and often confounding
      treatment programs. This review is designed to assist the practitioner when in
      [corrected] incorporating new or novel therapies into a treatment program. These

TI  - Prevalence and outcome of allergic colitis in healthy infants with rectal
      bleeding: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis is often diagnosed clinically in healthy infants
      with rectal bleeding and often treated with costly hypoallergenic formula. The
      true prevalence of allergic colitis is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that
      allergic colitis is overdiagnosed in healthy infants with rectal bleeding. The
      authors also determined whether rectal bleeding in infants without allergic
      colitis would resolve without diet change. METHODS: For the purposes of this
      study, allergic colitis was defined histologically as colonic mucosa with >or= 6 
      eosinophils per high power field and/or eosinophils in colonic crypts or
      muscularis mucosae. We surveyed all 56 Ohio NASPGHAN members to determine
      standard practice regarding the evaluation of rectal bleeding in infants. In
      addition, infants <or= 6 months old with rectal bleeding were recruited from the 
      referral area of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All infants
      underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies at 5, 10 and 15 cm. Formula or
      maternal diet was changed only for infants with histologic findings of allergic
      colitis as defined. Study subjects were followed for 9 weeks. RESULTS: In the
      survey of NASPGHAN members, 84% indicated they would empirically change the diet 
      of an infant with rectal bleeding to treat presumed allergic colitis. In our
      study population, however, only 14 of 22 (64%; 95% confidence interval, 41-83)
      infants with rectal bleeding had allergic colitis. Five (23%) had normal biopsies
      and three (14%) had nonspecific colitis. Rectal bleeding in all infants with
      normal biopsies or nonspecific colitis resolved without diet change except for 1 
      infant subsequently diagnosed with infantile inflammatory bowel disease.
      CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of infants with rectal bleeding may not have
      allergic colitis and may undergo unnecessary, expensive formula or maternal diet 
      changes that may discourage breast-feeding.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotic-mixture induces remission in patients with active ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1539-46
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal bacteria have been implicated in the initiation
      and perpetuation of IBD; in contrast, "probiotic bacteria" have properties
      possibly effective in treating and preventing relapse of IBD. We evaluated the
      safety and efficacy of VSL#3 and the components, and the composition of the
      biopsy-associated microbiota in patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative 
      colitis (UC). METHODS: Thirty-four ambulatory patients with active UC received
      open label VSL#3, 3,600 billion bacteria daily in two divided doses for 6 wk. The
      presence of biopsy-associated bacteria was detected using a nucleic acid-based
      method and the presence of VSL#3 species confirmed by DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA.
      RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed 6 wk of VSL#3 treatment and 2 patients did
      not have the final endoscopic assessment. Intent to treat analysis demonstrated
      remission (UCDAI < or = 2) in 53% (n = 18); response (decrease in UCDAI > or = 3,
      but final score > or =3) in 24% (n = 8); no response in 9% (n = 3); worsening in 
      9% (n = 3); and failure to complete the final sigmoidoscopy assessment in 5% (n =
      2). There were no biochemical or clinical adverse events related to VSL#3. Two of
      the components of VSL#3 were detected by PCR/DGGE in biopsies collected from 3
      patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with mild to moderate
      UC, not responding to conventional therapy, with VSL#3 resulted in a combined
      induction of remission/response rate of 77% with no adverse events. At least some
      of the bacterial species incorporated in the probiotic product reached the target
      site in amounts that could be detected.

TI  - Human defensins in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 42-54
AB  - Crohn's disease, a transmural inflammation of the gut, has been linked to good
      childhood hygiene, frequent use of antibiotics before diagnosis, adherent or
      invasive mucosal bacteria and a break in the tolerance of luminal bacteria. A
      decrease or lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics may play a central role in the
      etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The dysregulated adaptive immune system may 
      reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response
      is mostly directed against luminal bacteria. Crohn's disease patients with ileal 
      involvement, as compared to controls and Crohn's disease patients without ileal
      disease, are characterized by a diminished expression of the ileal Paneth cell
      defensins. This decrease is even more pronounced in Crohn's disease patients with
      a mutation in the NOD2 gene, which is associated with Crohn's disease and ileal
      involvement. NOD2 is an intracellular peptidoglycan receptor and is expressed in 
      Paneth cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease of the colon is 
      characterized by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. The
      hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with 
      the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain disease states.

TI  - [Pouchitis treatment by probiotics].
PG  - 63-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to review the principal effects of
      probiotics on pouchitis and identify their mechanisms of action. METHODS: The
      study was based on a review of all relevant studies published in the literature
      on the effects of probiotics in pouchitis and their possible mechanisms of
      action. RESULTS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch 
      anal anstomosis for ulcerative colitis. The cause is still unknown but is likely 
      to be multifactorial. An imbalance in the usual fecal flora was recently
      suggested. Most patients with symptoms of pouchitis respond promptly to
      antibiotics. However, 5-10% of them develop rapidly relapsing symptoms that
      required protacted therapy. Porbiotics are living microorganisms that ingested in
      adequate amounts exert beneficial effects. Promising results have been obtained
      with probiotics mainly in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis and also 
      as induction of remission. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that restoring the
      microbial imbalance may offer an effective therapeutic alternative to patients
      with pouchitis.

TI  - Dietary peptides increase endogenous amino acid losses from the gut in adults.
PG  - 1359-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of endogenous ileal total nitrogen and amino acid 
      flows are necessary to ascertain true dietary amino acid digestibility
      coefficients and for the factorial estimation of dietary amino acid requirements.
      OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain endogenous amino acid losses from the
      small bowel in human subjects consuming a protein-free diet or a diet with
      enzyme-hydrolyzed casein (EHC; MW <5000) as the sole source of nitrogen. DESIGN: 
      The subjects were 8 men and women with terminal ileum ileostomies after
      ulcerative colitis who consumed the protein-free and EHC-based diets in a
      crossover design. Each subject received each test diet in single meals followed
      by 2 consecutive 9-h total collections of digesta. Digesta samples for the EHC
      treatment were centrifuged and ultrafiltered (10 000 MW cutoff), with the
      precipitate-plus-retentate fraction (>10 000 MW) providing a measurement of
      endogenous ileal amino acids. RESULTS: The mean endogenous flows for most of the 
      amino acids and nitrogen were significantly (P < 0.05) higher when determined
      with the EHC-based diet than with the protein-free diet. Mean (n = 8) endogenous 
      ileal nitrogen flows were 2061 and 4233 mug/g dry matter intake for the
      protein-free and EHC-based diets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The traditional
      protein-free method underestimates endogenous ileal amino acid loss in adults.

TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel 
      disease is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      lamina propria mononuclear cells.
PG  - 417-26
AB  - IL-6/STAT-3 signals play key roles in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is
      known that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) improves inflammatory
      disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD 
      and to clarify the mechanism. We focused the inhibitory effect of LcS on the
      production of IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated large intestinal lamina
      propria mononuclear cells (LI-LPMC) isolated from mice with chronic colitis and
      in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We also determined in vivo the effect of LcS on
      murine chronic IBD models induced with dextran sodium sulphate and SAMP1/Yit
      mice. Finally, we examined the cellular determinants of LcS for the
      down-regulation of IL-6 secretion by LI-LPMC, RAW264.7 cells and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). LcS,
      but not other strains of Lactobacillus, inhibited the production of IL-6 in
      LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC and RAW264.7 cells, down-regulating the nuclear
      translocation of NF-kappaB. The LcS-diet-improved murine chronic colitis is
      associated with the reduction of IL-6 synthesis by LI-LPMC. LcS also improved
      chronic ileitis in SAMP1/Yit mice. The release of IL-6 in vitro in LPS-stimulated
      LI-LPMC, RAW 264.7 cells and UC-PBMC was inhibited by a
      polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) derived from LcS. This
      probiotic-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel disease is
      associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6
      and IFN-gamma production in LPMC. Therefore, LcS may be a useful probiotic for
      the treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: possible mechanisms of action.
PG  - 426-30
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria that confer health
      benefits beyond their nutritional value. In inflammatory bowel disease, where
      changes in bacterial flora have been demonstrated, there is an increasing
      interest in modulating the flora with probiotic strains. The beneficial effect of
      probiotics is demonstrated mainly in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis; however,
      their mechanisms of action are not well defined. The purpose of this review is to
      discuss the latest findings related to their mechanism of action. RECENT
      FINDINGS: A decrease in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-gamma,
      TNF-alpha and IL-12, and interference with bacterial adherence to the epithelium 
      has been demonstrated. At the molecular level, an anti-inflammatory effect
      associated with NF-kappaB inhibition, heat-shock protein induction and proteasome
      inhibition has been suggested, although NF-kappaB induction has also been
      demonstrated. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects described were achieved not
      only by live bacteria but also by gamma-irradiated nonviable bacteria, bacterial 
      DNA components and probiotic-cultured media. SUMMARY: Understanding the
      mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease and experimental colitis may help understand the role of bacteria
      in disease pathogenesis. The findings that live probiotics may not be mandatory
      to be beneficial, and that therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic,
      rather than oral administration could have a major impact on the practical use
      and manufacturing of probiotics.

AB  - The pathogenic role of certain microorganism of intestinal flora has been
      demonstrated in experimental colitis in animals and strongly suspected in
      inflammatory bowel disease in human, especially in Crohn's disease and pouchitis.
      Probiotics are living non pathogenic microorganisms that, upon oral ingestion
      exert benefits on human health by modulating enteric flora or by stimulation of
      local immune system. The aim of this article is to remind the role of intestinal 
      flora in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism of inflammation induced by
      this flora and to review through the literature, the different clinical studies
      performed with probiotics in human.

TI  - An outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis associated with unpasteurized 
      gouda cheese.
PG  - 182-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cluster of E. coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis was identified in
      metro Edmonton, Alberta through notifiable disease surveillance in late 2002.
      METHODS: Environmental health officers collected food histories and clinical
      information from cases in the cluster. The provincial public health laboratory
      conducted pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis on E. coli O157:H7
      isolates from cluster cases. Public health and food regulatory agencies conducted
      an investigation when a food source (unpasteurized gouda cheese) was implicated. 
      RESULTS: PFGE analysis revealed an "outbreak" profile in 13 cases. Onset dates
      for the outbreak cases ranged between October 2002 and February 2003. Two cases, 
      aged 22 months and 4 years, developed hemolytic uremic syndrome as a result of
      their infection. Consumption of unpasteurized gouda cheese produced at a local
      dairy farm was reported by 12 of 13 outbreak cases in the 2 to 8 days prior to
      illness. E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 2 of 26 cheese samples manufactured by
      the implicated producer. The cheese isolates had indistinguishable PFGE profiles 
      as compared with outbreak case isolates. Implicated cheese was found to be
      contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 104 days after production, despite having met
      regulated microbiological and aging requirements. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge,
      this is the first confirmed outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infection in Canada
      associated with raw milk hard cheese. A review of federal legislation vis-a-vis
      raw milk hard cheese may be in order.

TI  - Nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is
      widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a
      variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to
      ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN)
      or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine
      receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. 
      Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based
      enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third
      is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term
      treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as
      unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have
      attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN,
      especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much
      long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy
      because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data
      show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on
      clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were
      resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering
      CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic
      colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the
      treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a 
      maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to
      Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do
      not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies,
      including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over 
      those we have at present.

AB  - Pouchitis is a common and long-term complication of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 
      in patients with underlying ulcerative colitis. Combination with clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic and histopathological findings are required to make accurate
      diagnosis. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole are effective in patients with acute
      pouchitis. Probiotics may be useful in maintaining regression and preventing from
      remission. Immunomodulating agents are also useful in chronic pouchitis.

AB  - Although the causes of inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease remain incompletely understood, increasing evidence
      implicates intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Therefore,
      modulation of microflora with probiotics or prebiotics may offer a plausible
      therapeutic approach. While recent data support a potential therapeutic efficacy,
      such treatments need to be further assessed by large scale studies. A better
      understanding of the intestinal microflora and the mechanisms of their action may
      help us to develop more effective treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Increased potency of a novel complement factor 5a receptor antagonist in a rat
      model of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 811-7
AB  - We have previously shown that complement factor 5a (C5a) plays a role in the
      pathogenesis of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in
      rats by using the selective, orally active C5a antagonist AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR]. This
      study tested the efficacy and potency of a new C5a antagonist, hydrocinnamate
      (HC)-[OP(d-Cha)WR], which has limited intestinal lumenal metabolism, in this
      model of colitis. Analogs of AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR] were examined for their
      susceptibility to alimentary metabolism in the rat using intestinal mucosal
      washings. One metabolically stable analog, HC-[OP(d-Cha)WR], was then evaluated
      pharmacokinetically and investigated at a range of doses (0.03-10 mg/kg/day p.o.)
      in the 8-day rat TNBS-colitis model, against the comparator drug
      AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR]. Using various amino acid substitutions, it was determined that
      the AcF moiety of AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR] was responsible for the metabolic instability
      of the compound in intestinal mucosal washings. The analog HC-[OP(d-Cha)WR],
      equiactive in vitro to AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR], was resistant to intestinal metabolism,
      but it displayed similar oral bioavailability to AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR]. However, in
      the rat TNBS-colitis model, HC-[OP(d-Cha)WR] was effective at reducing mortality,
      colon edema, colon macroscopic scores, and increasing food consumption and body
      weights, at 10- to 30-fold lower oral doses than AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR]. These studies
      suggest that resistance to intestinal metabolism by HC-[OP(d-Cha)WR] may result
      in increased local concentrations of the drug in the colon, thus affording
      efficacy with markedly lower oral doses than AcF-[OP(d-Cha)WR] against
      TNBS-colitis. This large increase in potency and high efficacy of this compound
      makes it a potential candidate for clinical development against intestinal
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Mucosal bacteria in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - S67-72
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease of
      unknown aetiology, although bacterial species belonging to the normal colonic
      microbiota are known to be involved in its initiation and maintenance. Several
      organisms have been linked to the disease; however, mucosa-associated bacteria
      are more likely to be involved than their luminal counterparts, due to their
      close proximity to the host epithelium. Comparative bacteriological analyses were
      done on rectal biopsies to investigate differences in mucosal bacteria in
      patients with UC and healthy controls. Complex bacterial communities were found
      in both groups, with significant reductions in bifidobacterial numbers in UC,
      which suggested that they might have a protective role in the disease.
      Accordingly, a therapy for treating UC was designed, with the aim of modifying
      the mucosal microbiota to increase bifidobacterial colonisation and reduce
      inflammation. Ranges of mucosal and faecal bifidobacteria were tested for their
      substrate preferences and their abilities to survive under a variety of
      environmental conditions. A synbiotic comprising a probiotic (Bifidobacterium
      longum) isolated from healthy rectal mucosa combined with a prebiotic
      (oligofructose-enriched inulin - Synergy 1) was developed. The treatment was used
      in a randomised controlled trial involving eighteen patients with active UC, for 
      a period of 1 month. Rectal biopsies were collected at the beginning and end of
      the study. Bacteriological analysis and transcription levels of
      epithelium-related immune markers were assessed. Results demonstrated that
      short-term synbiotic treatment resulted in increased bifidobacterial colonisation
      of the rectal mucosa and induced significant reductions in the expression of
      molecules that control inflammation in active UC.

TI  - Inulin and oligofructose: impact on intestinal diseases and disorders.
PG  - S61-5
AB  - A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the
      human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both
      physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be
      optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the
      metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data
      suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation
      of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the
      prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of
      inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis
      induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human
      ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that
      resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic 
      production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or
      bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation
      and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment
      reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch
      mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic
      inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further
      clinical studies.

TI  - [Probiotics as therapeutic agents in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 467-71
AB  - Probiotics are defined as living micro-organisms which, when administered in
      large amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. The use of probiotics in the 
      therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of
      ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies
      proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the
      course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement 
      of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota 
      and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in
      reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather
      small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always
      closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the
      effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Probiotic therapy in the prevention of pouchitis onset: decreased
      interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and interferon-gamma gene expression.
PG  - 447-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic therapy has been shown to prevent the onset of pouchitis
      and to improve the quality of life in ulcerative colitis patients who required
      ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Pouchitis has been associated with elevated levels 
      of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. METHODS: In this retrospective
      analysis of archived endoscopic samples from responding patients enrolled in the 
      above-mentioned trial, we were interested in studying mucosal gene expression of 
      the pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6), TH1
      cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12),
      regulatory cytokines (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-beta), and the
      chemokine interleukin-8. In addition to assessment of cytokine gene expression,
      the presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the mucosal tissue was evaluated.
      RESULTS: Data show that patients who were treated with probiotics had significant
      lower mucosal mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and
      interferon-gamma compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, a lower
      number of polymorphonuclear cells was present in the tissue of patients within
      the probiotic group compared with the number of polymorphonuclear cells in the
      tissue of patients receiving placebo and patients having an episode of pouchitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that probiotic treatment regulates the mucosal
      immune response by reducing mucosal levels of neutrophil-chemoattractant IL-8 and
      tissue influx of polymorphonuclear cells, and may further act by inhibition of
      T-cell activation, by reinforcement of barrier function and by a tight control of
      the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta.

TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis: are they less common
      with poorly absorbed antimicrobials?
PG  - 81-9
AB  - Diarrhea is a well-known complication of antibiotic therapy. Rates of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) vary from 5 to 25%. Some antibiotics are
      more likely to cause diarrhea than others, specifically, those that are broad
      spectrum and those that target anaerobic flora. This paper reviews the effects of
      antibiotics on the fecal flora as well as host factors which contribute to AAD.
      Clinical features and treatment of AAD are also described. Prevention of AAD
      rests on wise antibiotic policies, the use of probiotics and prevention of
      acquisition in the hospital setting. Data from clinical trials suggest that
      poorly absorbed antimicrobials might have a decreased risk of causing AAD and
      Clostridium difficile-associated disease, as concluded from studies of
      antibiotics used for preoperative bowel decontamination and poorly absorbed
      antibiotics used for traveler's diarrhea. Controlled trials would prove this but 
      are not yet available. Probiotics may be a good adjunct to poorly absorbed
      antibiotics to minimize the risk of diarrhea associated with antibiotics.

TI  - Fatal necrotizing colitis following a foodborne outbreak of enterotoxigenic
      Clostridium perfringens type A infection.
PG  - e78-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens type A is the third leading
      cause of foodborne disease in the United States, resulting annually in an
      estimated 250,000 cases of a typically mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal
      illness. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine the
      cause of a small cluster of cases of gastrointestinal illness, which included
      cases of severe necrotizing colitis. Participants in the study consisted of
      residents and staff of a residential care facility for the mentally ill in
      Oklahoma (n = 20). An inspection of food preparation and food storage areas of
      the residential care facility was conducted as part of an environmental
      investigation. The investigation included extensive microbiological and molecular
      testing of the C. perfringens isolates and tissue specimens collected at autopsy.
      RESULTS: A total of 7 (3 confirmed and 4 probable) cases of foodborne
      enterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A were identified (attack rate, 35%) after
      the consumption of high-risk foods. Three residents developed acute necrotizing
      colitis; 2 of them died. Each patient with confirmed infection presented with
      evidence of constipation or fecal impaction. C. perfringens enterotoxin
      (CPE)-positive C. perfringens type A was cultured on samples from each patient
      with necrotizing colitis. Although statistical analyses failed to implicate a
      food source, the isolates carried a chromosomal cpe gene, which supports a
      foodborne origin. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that foodborne CPE-positive C.
      perfringens type A can affect the colon, resulting in potentially fatal
      necrotizing colitis. Drug-induced constipation and fecal impaction, resulting in 
      prolonged exposure of the colonic mucosal tissue to C. perfringens type A toxins,
      contributed to the development of necrotizing colitis.

TI  - Outcome of four weeks' intervention with probiotics on symptoms and endoscopic
      appearance after surgical reconstruction with a J-configurated
      ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition in patients operated
      on with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA). A disturbed microecology in the
      pouch has been suggested as one possible explanation. In a previous double-blind,
      randomized, controlled study we demonstrated clinical improvement of symptoms in 
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) operated on with IPAA, during intervention 
      with live probiotic microbes Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteriae. The aim of the
      present study was to confirm our previous results in a much larger material,
      including clinical symptoms, faecal flora and endoscopic evaluation, and to
      compare the results in UC/IPAA patients with those of patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with IPAA and UC patients with ileorectal anastomosis
      (IRA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five hundred millilitres of a fermented milk product
      (Cultura) containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteriae (Bb-12) was
      given daily for 4 weeks to 51 UC patients and 10 patients with FAP, operated on
      with IPAA, and six UC patients operated on for IRA. Stool samples were cultured
      for examination of lactobacilli, bifidobacteriae, fungi and pH before, during and
      after intervention. Before, during and after intervention, endoscopic evaluation 
      was performed. Categorized symptomatology was examined prospectively using diary 
      cards in addition to an interview, before and on the last day of intervention.
      RESULTS: The number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteriae increased significantly
      during intervention in the UC patients operated on with IPAA and remained
      significantly increased one week after intervention. Involuntary defecation,
      leakage, abdominal cramps and the need for napkins (category I), faecal number
      and consistency (category II) and mucus and urge to evacuate stools (category
      III) were significantly decreased during intervention in the UC/IPAA group. In
      the FAP group there was a significant decrease in faecal leakage, abdominal
      cramps and use of napkins (category I) during intervention. The median endoscopic
      score of inflammation was significantly decreased during intervention in the
      UC/IPAA patients. Blood tests, faecal fungi and faecal pH did not change
      significantly during intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this extended study,
      showing an effect of probiotics on symptoms and endoscopic inflammation in UC
      patients operated on with IPAA confirm our previously reported effect of
      probiotics on clinical symptoms and endoscopic score in a smaller, double-blind, 
      randomized, controlled study. The significantly higher response to probiotics in 
      families with increased risk of IBD will have to be repeated in future studies.

TI  - Effects of dietary fiber on inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 601-8
AB  - The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction
      towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which
      upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators,
      thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal
      conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment 
      in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and
      butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial
      fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with 
      butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs
      have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. 
      Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase
      colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber
      to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy 
      of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the
      rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of 
      action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.

TI  - An oral supplement enriched with fish oil, soluble fiber, and antioxidants for
      corticosteroid sparing in ulcerative colitis: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 358-69
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: N-3 fatty acids from fish oil, antioxidants, and short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) produced during the fermentation of soluble fiber may
      attenuate inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). We assessed the
      efficacy of a nutritionally balanced oral supplement enriched with fish oil,
      fructooligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium on disease
      activity and medication use in adults with mild to moderate UC. METHODS: A total 
      of 121 patients with UC and a disease activity index (DAI) from 3-9 on a 12-point
      scale were block randomized for extent of disease and smoking status. In addition
      to their usual diet, patients consumed 18 oz of the oral supplement or a
      carbohydrate-based placebo formula each day for 6 months. Clinical and histologic
      responses were assessed at 3 and 6 months or at the final visit. A change in
      average prednisone use between groups was tested by using a linear mixed-effects 
      model. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics
      were not different between groups except for a higher total DAI score in the oral
      supplement group (7.3 +/- 1.3; n = 36) compared with the placebo group (6.2 +/-
      2.0; n = 50) ( P < .05). Both groups showed significant and similar degree of
      improvement at 6 months in DAI (-2.5 for oral supplement and -2.8 for placebo)
      and histologic index (-1.9 for oral supplement vs. -2.0 for placebo). Both
      intent-to-treat and completed patients given oral supplement had a significantly 
      greater rate of decrease in the dose of prednisone required to control clinical
      symptoms over 6 months as compared with the placebo group ( P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in clinical response combined with a decreased
      requirement for corticosteroids suggest that this enriched oral supplement can be
      a useful adjuvant therapy in patients with UC.

TI  - A potent and selective inhibitor of group IIa secretory phospholipase A2 protects
      rats from TNBS-induced colitis.
PG  - 883-92
AB  - Secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) enzymes have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study we compared
      the efficacy of a potent, new and highly selective inhibitor of group IIa human
      sPLA(2) enzyme (5-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)-4S-(7-phenylheptanoylamino)-pentanoic acid;
      sPLA(2)I), with that of sulfasalazine, in a rat model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic
      acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Following a single oral dose of sPLA(2)I (5 mg/kg), 
      pharmacoactive levels of drug were detected in the serum within 15 min and for up
      to 24 h by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Rats treated with
      sPLA(2)I (5 mg/kg/day) prior to induction of colitis were significantly healthier
      than TNBS-alone rats, as shown by reduced mortality, improved food intake and
      increased body weight, and significantly reduced colon myeloperoxidase levels,
      edema, tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels, and colon macroscopic pathology
      scores after 8 days. Rats pretreated with sulfasalazine (100 mg/kg/day) also had 
      reduced disease expression markers similar to the sPLA(2)I, but exhibited no
      improvement in colon edema. This study supports a role for the group IIa sPLA(2) 
      enzyme in pathology associated with the TNBS rat model of IBD, and suggests a
      possible therapeutic application for selective inhibitors of group IIa sPLA(2)
      inhibitors in the treatment of IBD.

TI  - The beneficial effects of microflora, especially obligate anaerobes, and their
      products on the colonic environment in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1047-53
AB  - Because intestinal microflora play a pivotal role in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in alternating
      the composition of the microflora toward a potentially more remedial community.
      This paper summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation 
      of microflora by the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics in IBD.
      Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic whose unique characteristics
      make it highly suitable for applications in IBD. It also helps prolong remission 
      in remissive ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and also attenuates clinical
      activity in non-remissive UC patients. GBF has shown to be converted into a
      preferential nutrient, butyrate, for colonocytes through the action of
      Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium, and this bacterial butyrate can provide
      anti-inflammatory effects. The probiotic approaches for IBD include VSL#3,
      Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum, and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. In this
      paper, we summarize the distinctive role of another probiotic, Eubacterium
      limosum (E. limosum), which is a commensal microorganism that is promoted by GBF 
      administration. The metabolites of E. limosum included butyrate, which can
      accelerate intestinal epithelial growth and inhibit IL-6 production. This new
      probiotic approach may be useful as an adjunctive IBD treatment in the future.
      Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some
      settings, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to firmly establish
      their relevance.

TI  - Green fluorescent protein for detection of the probiotic microorganism
      Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in vivo.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms are defined as viable nutritional agents conferring
      benefit to the health of the human host. Especially, Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) was shown to be equally effective as mesalazine in the
      maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presumably, the therapeutic 
      effect of EcN is linked to the presence of the strain in the region of interest; 
      however, it remains difficult to follow the orally administered strain on its
      passage through the complex microbial environment of the intestine in vivo,
      inhabited dominantly by various E. coli strains, using traditional culturing
      methods. In this study we transformed EcN and a wild-type E. coli from a
      laboratory rat (EcR) with a plasmid carrying a gfp gene (pUC-gfp) to obtain EcN- 
      and EcR-GFP to allow in vivo detection without alteration of strain-specific
      characteristics. Analysis of different strain-specific characteristics included
      the measurement of stimulation of IL-8 secretion and adhesion in vitro using the 
      epithelial cell line HT-29. The kinetics of intestinal distribution in mice and
      colonization properties in rats following oral administration was studied in
      vivo. Detectability of the strain in histologic specimens was analysed using
      fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The identity of fluorescent E. 
      coli strains isolated from stool samples, Peyer's patches (PP) and mesenteric
      lymph nodes (MLN) was determined by REP-PCR. We were able to demonstrate that EcN
      and EcN-GFP do not differ in stimulation of IL-8 secretion or adhesion to HT-29
      cells. In vivo, EcN-GFP colonies were readily detectable by fluorescence
      microscopy in luminal samples and also by immunohistochemistry in histological
      sections allowing analysis of the kinetics of the intestinal passage following
      oral administration. Translocation of fluorescent and non-fluorescent bacteria
      into PP and MLN was noted at 6 h post oral administration. EcN-GFP was detectable
      initially for 14 days in faecal samples of rats, while EcR-GFP was detectable
      throughout the whole experiment (45 days). Challenge with ampicillin at day 45
      demonstrated continuing presence of EcN-GFP in small numbers by reappearing
      fluorescent colonies. The plasmid was not stable in vivo since non-fluorescent
      EcN colonies were detected also in faecal samples by REP-PCR. In summary,
      transformation of EcN to obtain EcN-GFP in our study had no detectable influence 
      on the probiotic microorganism regarding adhesion on and induction of IL-8
      secretion of HT-29 cells and allows the detection in mixed microbial environments
      in vivo but the stability of EcN-GFP in vivo is limited.

TI  - A murine model of ulcerative colitis: induced with sinusitis-derived superantigen
      and food allergen.
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is to be understood. The
      basic pathological feature of UC is intestinal chronic inflammation.
      Superantigen, such as Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), is reported to
      compromise intestinal barrier function by increasing epithelial permeability and 
      initiate inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Inasmuch as anatomic position of 
      the sinus, chronic sinusitis-derived SEB may follow the secretion and to be
      swallowed down to the gastrointestinal tract and induce lesions to the intestinal
      mucosa. METHODS: Sinus wash fluid (SWF, containing SEB) was collected from a
      group of patients with both chronic sinusitis (CS) and UC. A group of mice were
      sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) in the presence of SWF. The sensitized mice were
      challenged with the specific antigen OVA. The inflammatory status of the colonic 
      tissue was determined with histology, serology and electron microscopy. Using
      horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer, another group of mice was stimulated
      with SWF for 2 hours. The HRP activity was detected in the colonic tissue with
      enzymatic approaches and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Epithelial
      hyperpermeability in colonic epithelium was induced by stimulating with SWF. The 
      HRP activity in the colonic mucosa was almost 11 times more in the SWF treated
      group (3.2 +/- 0.6 microg/g tissue) than the control group (0.3 +/- 0.1 microg/g 
      tissue). Mice were sensitized using a mixture of SWF and OVA (serum OVA-specific 
      IgE was detected with a highest titer as 1:64). Challenge with OVA induced
      extensive inflammation in the colonic mucosa by showing (1) marked degranulation 
      in mast cells (MC, 46.3 +/- 4.5%) and eosinophils (Eo, 55.7 +/- 4.2%); (2)
      inflammatory cell infiltration (MC = 145.2 +/- 11.4; Eo = 215.8 +/- 12.5;
      mononuclear cell = 258.4 +/- 15.3/mm2 tissue); (3) increased MPO activity (12.9
      +/- 3.2 U/g tissue) and inflammatory scores (1.8 +/- 0.3); (4) mucosal surface
      ulcers; (5) edema in the lamina propria; (6) bacterial translocation and abscess 
      formation in the subepithelial region. CONCLUSION: Introducing Sinusitis-derived 
      SEB-containing SWF to the gastrointestinal tract compromised colonic mucosal
      barrier function increasing epithelial permeability to luminal macromolecular
      protein in mice. The SWF facilitated colonic mucosal sensitization to luminal
      antigen. Multiple challenging the sensitized colonic mucosa with specific antigen
      OVA induced inflammation, induced a condition similar to human ulcerative
      colitis.

TI  - Lack of efficacy of a reduced microparticle diet in a multi-centred trial of
      patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and
      non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both
      the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings
      of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount 
      of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with
      active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo
      controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were
      randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in
      microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks. All patients received a reducing dose
      of prednisolone for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were Crohn's disease activity
      index, Van Hees index, quality of life and a series of objective measures of
      inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
      intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectin. After 16 weeks patients returned
      to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeks. RESULTS:
      Dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any 
      of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1
      year); e.g., for logistic regression of Crohn's disease activity index based
      rates of remission (P=0.1) and clinical response (P=0.8), in normal versus low
      microparticle groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our adequately powered and carefully
      controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake
      aids remission in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Intestinal immunity of Escherichia coli NISSLE 1917: a safe carrier for
      therapeutic molecules.
PG  - 373-84
AB  - The development of novel approaches that allow accurate targeting of therapeutics
      to the intestinal mucosa is a major task in the research on intestinal
      inflammation. For the first time, a live genetically modified bacterial strain
      has been approved by Dutch authorities as a therapeutic agent for experimental
      therapy of intestinal bowel disease (IBD) in humans. Genetically modified
      probiotics can very well be used as carriers for localized antigen delivery into 
      the intestine. Therapeutic safety, however, of such a carrier organism, is
      crucial, especially when a specific probiotic strain has to be used under
      diseased conditions. In this study, we tested the potential of Escherichia coli
      NISSLE 1917 to serve as a safe carrier for targeted delivery of recombinant
      proteins to the intestinal mucosa. In a well-defined and very sensitive
      immunological system, we demonstrate that intestinal recombinant E. coli NISSLE
      1917 has no effect on migration, clonal expansion and activation status of
      specific CD4+ T cells, neither in healthy mice nor in animals with acute colitis.
      Furthermore, recombinant E. coli NISSLE 1917 has no effect on the induction or
      breakdown of peripheral T-cell tolerance in an autoimmune environment. The
      excellent colonization properties of E. coli NISSLE 1917 render this strain an
      ideal candidate as carrier organism for gut-focused in situ synthesis of
      therapeutic molecules.

TI  - Associations between diet and disease activity in ulcerative colitis patients
      using a novel method of data analysis.
PG  - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relapsing nature and varying geographical prevalence of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates environmental factors such as diet in its
      aetiology. METHODS: In order to determine which foods might be related to disease
      activity in UC a new method of dietary analysis was developed and applied.
      Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process.
      Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a
      sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease))
      was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the
      person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food
      sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted)
      weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence
      of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all
      81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active
      disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by <10 people or weighing
      <1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods. RESULTS: High FSS
      foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite
      (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from
      concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin
      properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state
      than the caffeine containing version. Beneficial foods (average intake per week) 
      included pork (210 g), breakfast cereals (200 g), lettuce (110 g), apples and
      pears (390 g), milk (1250 ml), melon (350 g), bananas (350 g), bacon (120 g),
      beef and beef products (500 g), tomatoes (240 g), soup (700 g), citrus fruits
      (300 g), fish (290 g), yogurt (410 g), cheese (110 g), potatoes (710 g) and
      legumes (120 g). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary analysis method described provides a
      new tool for establishing relationships between diet and disease and indicates a 
      potentially therapeutic diet for UC.

TI  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli: pre- and postharvest control measures to 
      ensure safety of dairy cattle products.
PG  - 199-207
AB  - The large number of cases of human illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing
      Escherichia coli (STEC) worldwide has raised safety concerns for foods of bovine 
      origin. These human illnesses include diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic
      uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Severe cases end with
      chronic renal failure, chronic nervous system deficiencies, and death. Over 100
      STEC serotypes, including E. coli O157:H7, are known to cause these illnesses and
      to be shed in cattle feces. Thus, cattle are considered reservoirs of these
      foodborne pathogens. Because beef and dairy products were responsible for a large
      number of STEC outbreaks, efforts have been devoted to developing and
      implementing control measures that assure safety of foods derived from dairy
      cattle. These efforts should reduce consumers' safety concerns and support a
      competitive dairy industry at the production and processing levels. The efficacy 
      of control measures both before harvest (i.e., on-farm management practices) and 
      after harvest (i.e., milk processing and meat packing) for decreasing the risk of
      STEC contamination of dairy products was evaluated. The preharvest measures
      included sanitation during milking and management practices designed to decrease 
      STEC prevalence in the dairy herd (i.e., animal factors, manure handling,
      drinking water, and both feeds and feeding). The postharvest measures included
      the practices or treatments that could be implemented during processing of milk, 
      beef, or their products to eliminate or minimize STEC contamination.

TI  - Probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The author presents evidence published during the past year
      regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and
      infections by probiotic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Normal commensal bacteria are
      implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal
      inflammation, particularly Crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial,
      fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use
      of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Combinations of
      Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of
      recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation,
      whereas Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis.
      Several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. Use of
      probiotics in Crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. Animal models demonstrate
      marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and
      that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. Probiotics have multiple 
      mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth,
      binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of
      mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing
      proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). Although multiple probiotic 
      species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro,
      their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery
      from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of
      pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger,
      controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses;
      combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic 
      conditions.

TI  - Dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter case-control
      study in Japan.
PG  - 154-63
AB  - To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a 
      Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative
      colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years
      after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case 
      who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and
      nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and
      unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the
      food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC
      risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 
      95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils
      (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI,
      1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the 
      intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC
      risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90),
      monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45
      to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57;
      95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study
      suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most
      retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the
      associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the
      importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.

TI  - Tissue levels and post-prandial secretion of the intestinal growth factor,
      glucagon-like peptide-2, in controls and inflammatory bowel disease: comparison
      with peptide YY.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and peptide YY (PYY) are
      produced in endocrine L-cells of the intestine and secreted in response to food
      intake. GLP-2 has a trophic effect on the intestinal epithelium, whereas PYY has 
      pro-absorptive effects. It can be speculated that, in inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD), the production and secretion of GLP-2 and PYY could be affected as a part 
      of a regulatory mechanism. Therefore, tissue levels and meal-stimulated secretion
      of GLP-2 and PYY were studied in IBD patients and compared to controls. METHODS: 
      Outpatients with IBD and control patients were included. Mucosal biopsies were
      taken from the ileum and colon and the content of GLP-2 and PYY was measured.
      After colonoscopy the patients took a mixed meal and plasma was collected for 90 
      min for plasma measurements of GLP-2 and PYY. RESULTS: Tissue levels of GLP-2 in 
      control patients were highest in the terminal ileum (407+/-82 pmol/g tissue,
      n=10), whereas PYY was highest in the rectum (919+/-249 pmol/g tissue, n=10). In 
      IBD patients with acute inflammation, the content of GLP-2 was similar to
      controls, whereas PYY was decreased to 72.1+/-17.7% (P=0.03, n=13) of control
      values. Neither the fasting plasma levels nor the meal responses of GLP-2 and PYY
      differed between controls and IBD patients. CONCLUSION: The similar responses of 
      GLP-2 and PYY in patients and controls do not support the suggestion that L-cell 
      secretion is altered in IBD. The decreased tissue PYY concentrations may
      contribute to the diarrhoea of some of these patients.

TI  - Synbiotic therapy (Bifidobacterium longum/Synergy 1) initiates resolution of
      inflammation in patients with active ulcerative colitis: a randomised controlled 
      pilot trial.
PG  - 242-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory
      disease of the large bowel with unknown aetiology. The immune response against
      normal commensal microorganisms is believed to drive inflammatory processes
      associated with UC. Therefore, modulation of bacterial communities on the gut
      mucosa, through the use of probiotics and prebiotics, may be used to modify the
      disease state. METHODS: A synbiotic was developed for use in UC patients
      combining a probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum, isolated from healthy rectal
      epithelium, and a prebiotic (Synergy 1), a preferential inulin-oligofructose
      growth substrate for the probiotic strain. Treatment was employed in a double
      blinded randomised controlled trial using 18 patients with active UC for a period
      of one month. Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected
      before and after treatment, and transcription levels of epithelium related immune
      markers were measured. RESULTS: Sigmoidoscopy scores (scale 0-6) were reduced in 
      the test group (start 4.5 (1.4), end 3.1 (2.5)) compared with placebo (start 2.6 
      (2.1), end 3.2 (2.2)) (p=0.06). mRNA levels for human beta defensins 2, 3, and 4,
      which are strongly upregulated in active UC, were significantly reduced in the
      test group after treatment (p=0.016, 0.038, and 0.008, respectively). Tumour
      necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1alpha, which are inflammatory cytokines
      that drive inflammation and induce defensin expression, were also significantly
      reduced after treatment (p=0.018 and 0.023, respectively). Biopsies in the test
      group had reduced inflammation and regeneration of epithelial tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: Short term synbiotic treatment of active UC resulted in improvement 
      of the full clinical appearance of chronic inflammation in patients receiving
      this therapy.

TI  - Characterization of breast milk received by infants with gross blood in stools.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to ascertain factors that might be
      protective of the appearance of gross blood in the stools of breast-fed infants. 
      METHODS: Logistic regression models were formed to search for variables possibly 
      explaining the condition. In addition to the analyzed breast milk factors,
      mother's allergic disease was introduced into the models to control for its
      possible confounding effect. The breast milk samples, collected from mothers of
      infants with gross blood in stools (n = 23) and from mothers of healthy
      age-matched infants (n = 71), were analyzed for concentrations of transforming
      growth factor-beta2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10,
      prostaglandin (PG)E2, cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) and fatty acid
      composition. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Increase in the concentrations of PGE2 and 
      Cys-LTs in the breast milk together with mother's allergic disease reduced the
      likelihood of gross blood in stools in the breast-fed infant. The results suggest
      that no single factor, but a combination of immunomodulatory factors may protect 
      the child from gross blood in the stools of breast-fed infants. Allergic disease 
      was not a risk factor as mother's allergic disease appeared to counterbalance the
      gross blood in stools. Due to the preliminary nature of the study, the results
      need to be verified in a larger setting. The challenge for the future lies in
      identifying of such active compounds for dietary modification to enforce
      particularly the properties of the breast milk which are immunoprotective for the
      infant and to reduce the likelihood of intestinal disorders in at risk infants.
