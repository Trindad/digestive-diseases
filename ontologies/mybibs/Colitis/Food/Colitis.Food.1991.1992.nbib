TI  - Crohn's disease & aflatoxins.
PG  - 277-9
AB  - An investigation to examine the relationship between Crohn's disease and
      aflatoxins, a group of structurally related toxic and carcinogenic metabolites,
      was carried out on 24 patients. Extracts of serum and urine from the patients
      were assayed qualitatively by thin layer chromatography and the Aflatest method, 
      and quantitatively by fluorimetry. There was evidence that some patients
      suffering from Crohn's Disease, together with some having coeliac disease and
      ulcerative colitis, did have varying amounts of aflatoxins in their serum and
      urine. The presence of aflatoxins may have been due to exposure to food
      containing these toxins or inability of the patient to excrete aflatoxins on
      account of some gastro-intestinal derangement. Only long-term investigation would
      establish the link between dietary history and the presence of aflatoxins in
      these patients.

TI  - Impaired fatty-meal-stimulated gallbladder contractility in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 689-93
AB  - 1. The incidence of gallstones in patients with Crohn's disease is increased
      compared with that in healthy control subjects. This is in part due to reduced
      terminal ileal bile salt absorption and consequent increased cholesterol
      saturation in bile. The aim of this study was to evaluate gallbladder
      contractility, a second important factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones, in
      Crohn's disease. 2. Thirty patients with Crohn's disease and no known biliary
      tract disease and nine healthy control subjects were studied. After an overnight 
      fast, gallbladder volume was determined by real-time ultrasonography before and
      10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min after ingestion of a standard liquid fatty meal. 3.
      Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with Crohn's disease had similar
      fasting gallbladder volumes (control, 18.7 +/- 2.3 ml; Crohn's disease, 18.2 +/- 
      2.3 ml). Percentage emptying was significantly impaired at 30, 40 and 50 min in
      patients with Crohn's disease compared with control subjects. Patients with
      Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel had gallbladder contractility that was
      comparable with that of control subjects, whereas in those with large-bowel
      disease, minimum residual gallbladder volume was significantly smaller than in
      control subjects. Patients with both large- and small-bowel Crohn's disease
      demonstrated the most marked abnormalities, with gallbladder volumes
      significantly larger than those of control subjects at 30, 40 and 50 min.
      Likewise, patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone previous bowel
      resection had impaired emptying at 30, 40 and 50 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

AB  - Colitis due to Clostridium difficile is diagnosed in 10%-15% of hospitalized
      patients who develop diarrhea after treatment with antimicrobial drugs. Diagnosis
      is based on the concurrence of diarrhea, one or more signs or symptoms of enteric
      intoxication, and stool from which toxigenic C. difficile is isolated or from
      which its toxins are identified. Clinical trials evaluating therapy may be
      placebo controlled (for mild disease) or concurrently controlled with an active
      drug. A randomized, double-blind study design is preferred. Outcome should be
      assessed by monitoring of the degree of inflammation of the bowel mucosa, the
      intensity and severity of diarrhea, the duration of illness, changes in stool
      form, and the eradication of C. difficile or its toxins from stool. Because C.
      difficile can be a component of the normal gastrointestinal flora, assessment of 
      clinical outcome is paramount.

PG  - 697-706
AB  - A double-blind cross-over long-term trial (18 months) with randomized
      supplementation with wheat fibre or ispaghula for two periods of six months,
      separated by a six-month wash-out period with placebo, was performed in ten
      patients with juvenile ulcerative colitis to study the effect on faecal bile acid
      (BA) excretion. All patients were in remission since 0.5-2 years and orally
      treated with sulphasalazine. The average intake of either fibres was 16 g day-1. 
      Faecal samples were collected (72 h) before and after each fibre period. Faecal
      water were prepared by centrifugation of faeces at 15,000 g for 2 h. BA in faeces
      and faecal water were studied using capillary column gas-liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. Faecal excretion of total BA were not
      significantly changed by the two fibres. Supplementation with wheat fibre, but
      not with ispaghula, decreased the faecal concentration of total BA by 43% (p <
      0.05), unconjugated BA by 41% (p < 0.01), and taurine conjugated BA by 58% (p <
      0.05). Addition of wheat fibre decreased the concentration of chenodeoxycholic
      acid by 66% (p < 0.05) and isomers of cholic acid by 51% (p < 0.05) in faeces.
      The mean faecal water concentration of taurine-conjugated BA decreased by 55%
      when wheat fibre was added (p < 0.05) and the concentration of isomers of
      deoxycholic acid increased by 39% when ispaghula was supplemented (p < 0.05). The
      ratio isomeric deoxycholic acid to deoxycholic acid in faecal water increased
      significantly when wheat fibre was added (p < 0.05). The percentage distribution 
      of secondary and ketonic BA was not influenced by the dietary fibre
      supplementation. The concentration of BA in faeces and faecal water decreased
      only by wheat fibre, suggesting that it is superior in obtaining an affect on
      faecal BA concentration.

TI  - Dietary fats and inflammatory bowel disease in Asians.
PG  - 386-8
AB  - Chemically processed, hydrogenated fats, such as margarine, have been implicated 
      in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. Toxic by-products may occur in
      their production or during frying and cooking. A survey of dietary oil usage was 
      conducted among Asians in Leicester, comparing inflammatory bowel disease
      patients with healthy controls. Two groups were comparable for age, sex,
      religion, place of birth, number of years spent in Britain and vegetarian status.
      There were no significant differences in actual oils used between healthy
      controls and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (chi 2 = 0.142
      and 1.803 respectively, p greater than 0.50). However patients with Crohn's
      disease were found to recycle their cooking oil significantly more often than age
      and sex-matched colitics (p less than 0.05) and particularly age and sex-matched 
      controls (p less than 0.01). A similar study needs to be conducted in India where
      the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is low. If this difference is
      confirmed a programme of health education in cooking habits could lower the
      incidence of Crohn's disease.

      mannan, gliadin, ovalbumin and betalactoglobulin in monozygotic twins with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 909-13
AB  - To assess whether dietary antigens play a role in inflammatory bowel disease, 26 
      monozygotic twin pairs with inflammatory bowel disease and 52 healthy controls
      were investigated for serum antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM) against ovalbumin,
      betalactoglobulin, gliadin, whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and yeast cell
      wall mannan. The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs
      discordant for Crohn's disease, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant 
      for ulcerative colitis. Two patients with Crohn's disease had a slight increase
      in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission. Two striking
      observations were made: first, individuals with ulcerative colitis were
      indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to
      gliadin. Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than
      controls. Second, twins who had developed Crohn's disease displayed higher
      antibody titres towards yeast cell wall mannan in particular, but also to whole
      yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of all antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM). In
      contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and betalactoglobulin did not
      differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls. The results
      argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired
      mucosal barrier in the inflammatory bowel disease. Rather, they suggest that
      yeast cell wall material--that is, mannan, or some antigen rich in mannose and
      cross reacting with mannan, may play an aetiological role in Crohn's disease, but
      not in ulcerative colitis. The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest
      that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s)
      present in the cell wall of baker's yeast.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis with fish oil supplementation: a prospective 12
      month randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 922-8
AB  - The effect of fish oil on the course of ulcerative colitis was investigated in a 
      randomised blinded controlled study. Eighty seven patients received supplements
      of 20 ml HiEPA fish oil as triglyceride (4.5 g of eicosapentaenoic acid) or olive
      oil placebo daily for one year. The oils were given in addition to standard drug 
      therapy and trial entry was stratified for disease activity. Fish oil
      significantly increased the eicosapentaenoic acid content of rectal mucosa to
      3.2% of total fatty acids at six months, compared with 0.63% for patients on
      olive oil. This was associated with increased synthesis of leukotriene B5, and
      53% suppression of leukotriene B4 synthesis by ionophore--stimulated neutrophils.
      Leukotriene B4 suppression persisted for at least two months after treatment was 
      stopped. Treatment with fish oil resulted in measurable, but only limited
      clinical benefit. For patients entering the trial in relapse (n = 53), there was 
      a significant reduction in corticosteroid requirement after one and two months
      treatment. There was a trend towards achieving remission (off corticosteroids)
      faster in the patients on fish oil, although differences were not significant.
      For patients in remission at trial entry or during the trial (n = 69), there was 
      no significant difference in the rate of relapse by log rank analysis. We
      conclude that fish oil supplementation produces a modest corticosteroid sparing
      effect in active disease, but there is no benefit in maintenance therapy.

PG  - 744-6
AB  - Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) is uncommon in the infant and complications
      requiring surgical intervention are rare. All prior cases have involved the
      direct administration of antibiotics to the child. A 2-month-old girl required
      bowel resection for perforation of a thickened and inflamed left colon. Findings 
      were consistent with PMC and the stool was Clostridium difficile toxin positive. 
      The patient was treated with vancomycin and did well. The patient's mother later 
      admitted to self-administration of ciprofloxacin while breast-feeding her infant.
      Oral doses of this drug are concentrated in breast milk at levels higher than
      serum. Antibiotics derived from breast milk can cause complicated PMC in the
      infant. A directed history can establish an early diagnosis and help distinguish 
      PMC from other more common infantile enterocolitides.

TI  - Dietary supplementation with fish oil in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 609-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in patients with
      active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover trail with 4-month treatment periods (fish oil and 
      placebo) separated by a 1-month washout. SETTING: Four gastroenterology
      divisions. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients with active ulcerative colitis entered 
      the study. Five dropped out, and one was noncompliant. Eighteen patients
      completed the study. All patients had active disease as manifested by diarrhea
      and rectal inflammation. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with prednisone and
      sulfasalazine was continued. Fish oil supplementation consisted of 18 Max-EPA
      (eicosapentaenoic acid) capsules daily (eicosapentaenoic acid, 3.24 g; and
      docosahexaenoic acid, 2.16 g). Placebo supplementation consisted of 18 identical 
      capsules containing isocaloric amounts of vegetable oil. MEASUREMENTS: Patients
      were evaluated at study entry and after each diet period. Evaluations included a 
      review of symptoms, flexible sigmoidoscopy, rectal biopsy, and rectal dialysis to
      measure prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 levels. RESULTS: Fish oil
      supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in rectal dialysate levels of 
      leukotriene B4 from 71.0 to 27.7 pg/mL (average change, -43.3 pg/mL; 95% CI, -83 
      to -3.6). Significant improvements were seen in acute histology index (average
      change, -8.5 units from a baseline of 10.5 units; CI, -12.9 to -4.2) and total
      histology index (average change, -8.5 units from a baseline of 14.80; CI, -13.2
      to -3.8) as well as significant weight gain (average weight gain, 1.74 kg, CI,
      0.94 to 2.54). No significant changes occurred in any variable during the placebo
      period. Seven patients received concurrent treatment with prednisone. During the 
      fish oil supplementation period, the mean prednisone dose decreased from 12.9
      mg/d to 6.1 mg/d and rose from 10.4 mg/d to 12.9 mg/d during the placebo diet
      period (P greater than 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Four months of diet supplementation
      with fish oil in patients with inflammatory bowel disease resulted in reductions 
      in rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 levels, improvements in histologic findings,
      and weight gain.

TI  - Fish oil fatty acid supplementation in active ulcerative colitis: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study.
PG  - 432-7
AB  - Arachidonic acid metabolites formed by both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase
      pathways may contribute to the clinical diarrhea and colitis of inflammatory
      bowel disease. Patients with active ulcerative colitis have increased levels of
      leukotriene B4 in their rectal mucosa, and these levels tend to correlate with
      severity of the disease. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of ingestion of
      fish oil n-3-omega-fatty acids, inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis, in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. Eleven patients with ulcerative colitis of mild 
      to moderate severity were studied in a 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover trial of dietary supplementation with fish oil, which provided about
      4.2 g of omega-3- fatty acids per day. A disease activity index based on patient 
      symptoms and sigmoidoscopic appearance was used to assess efficacy. Mucosal
      leukotriene B4 production was measured by radioimmunoassay. Mean disease activity
      index declined 56% for patients receiving fish oil and 4% for patients on placebo
      (p less than 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in
      histopathologic scores or colonic mucosal leukotriene B4 levels. All patients
      tolerated fish oil ingestion and showed no alteration in routine blood studies.
      No patient worsened; anti-inflammatory drugs could be reduced or eliminated in
      eight patients (72%) while receiving fish oil. We conclude that fish oil dietary 
      supplementation results in clinical improvement of active mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis but is not associated with significant reduction in mucosal
      leukotriene B4 production, compared with placebo therapy. Further studies are
      needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and optimal dose and duration of fish
      oil supplementation in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Nutrition support in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - Many patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, or
      ulcerative colitis have significant protein-calorie malnutrition and
      micronutrient deficiencies. Factors that contribute to these nutritional deficits
      include inadequate nutrient intake, malabsorption, excessive nutrient secretion
      across the diseased gastrointestinal tract, drug-nutrient interactions, and
      increased nutrient requirements. In this review, the use of enteral and
      parenteral nutrition support as primary therapy for active Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis is discussed. Other roles for nutrition support in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease, including preoperative nutrition support,
      nutritional treatment of intestinal fistulas and growth retardation, and home
      parenteral nutrition for gut failure, are also reviewed.

TI  - Outbreak of Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia infections in travellers
      returning from the tropics.
PG  - 78-82
AB  - Of 160 travellers from various regions in Italy who had taken part in a five-day 
      organized trip to Phuket, Thailand, and been accommodated in the same luxury
      hotel, 17 showed either amebic abscess or colitis. A pretested questionnaire that
      focused on the consumption of foods and beverages well known to be a source of
      intestinal infection in endemic areas was available from these 17 patients as
      well as from 41 out of 74 asymptomatic travellers. Stool samples for
      parasitological examination were also available. In patients affected with amebic
      abscess, antibodies to Entamoeba histolytica were also determined. Overall,
      parasitological examinations were negative in eight (13.8%) patients, and 50 out 
      of 58 (86.2%) were found to be positive. The prevalence of Giardia lamblia and E.
      histolytica infections was 67.2% and 72.4%, respectively, and 28 subjects (48.3%)
      were stool-positive for both of these protozoa. No other intestinal parasites
      were found. No particular food or beverage was consumed by all of the parasitized
      subjects and by none of the stool-negative individuals. However, the consumption 
      of drinks with ice, ice cream and raw fruit in ice was significantly associated
      with E. histolytica and/or G. lamblia infections (Fisher's exact test, p ranging 
      from 0.03 to 0.003).

AB  - Studies of body composition in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients
      demonstrated body cell mass depletion out of proportion to losses of body weight 
      or fat. The timing of death from wasting was related to the extent rather than
      the specific cause. However, some patients remain stable for indefinite periods, 
      indicating that wasting is not a constant phenomenon. The development of
      malnutrition is multifactorial and includes disorders of food intake, nutrient
      absorption and intermediary metabolism. Nutritional repletion has been
      demonstrated in several studies. The effect of treating infections that promote
      wasting was shown in a study of ganciclovir therapy for cytomegalovirus colitis, 
      in which untreated patients underwent progressive wasting whereas treated
      patients repleted body mass. Total parenteral nutrition had a variable effect
      upon body composition, with repletion occurring in patients with eating disorders
      or malabsorption syndromes and progressive depletion occurring in patients with
      serious systemic infections. Enteral nutrition also can replete body mass in AIDS
      patients without severe malabsorption. Pharmacologic stimulation of appetite also
      may lead to weight gain. The results of these studies indicate that nutritional
      support can improve nutritional status in properly selected AIDS patients.

TI  - Medical management of severe inflammatory disease of the rectum: nutritional
      aspects.
PG  - 27-41
AB  - It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional
      support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with
      enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no
      primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to
      nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted
      to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems
      to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease
      are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary
      therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific
      complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to
      stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection.
      Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental
      and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically
      defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic
      efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such,
      these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's
      disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who
      are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of
      topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds.
      Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be 
      restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being
      particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al,
      1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of
      patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most
      important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large
      losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe
      et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory
      bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or
      dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.

TI  - Low doses of drugs able to alter intestinal mucosal permeability to food antigens
      (5-aminosalicylic acid and sodium cromoglycate) do not reduce proteinuria in
      patients with IgA nephropathy: a preliminary noncontrolled trial.
PG  - 192-5
AB  - In an uncontrolled trial, patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) were treated with 
      drugs that can alter the intestinal mucosal permeability to food antigens. These 
      drugs are known to ameliorate urinary abnormalities and histological lesions of
      IgAN associated with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease [5-aminosalicylic acid
      (5-ASA)] or to prevent, in mice, the induction of IgAN-like disease by oral
      immunization [disodium cromoglycate (SCG)]. Nine patients [serum creatinine
      (s-Cr) less than 2 mg/dl; 24-hour proteinuria higher than 1.5 g, but not
      nephrotic) were treated with 5-ASA (2.4 g/day for 6 months); 9 similar patients
      were treated with SCG (400 mg/day for 6 months); the follow-up extended to 6
      months after stopping therapy. The 5-ASA group showed a slight but not
      significant decrease in s-Cr, 24-hour/proteinuria, IgA circulating immune
      complexes (IgA-CIC) and IgA rheumatoid factor (IgA-RF); serum beta
      2-microglobulin and serum IgA were unchanged; 2 of 9 treated patients showed,
      after 6 months of therapy, a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50% that
      lasted for the subsequent 18 months. The SCG-treated group showed a slight but
      not significant increase in 24-hour proteinuria and a significant decrease in
      serum IgA; unchanged were s-Cr, IgA-CIC, IgA-RF, serum beta 2-microglobulin; no
      patient treated with SCG showed a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50%. At
      the dosages and for the periods used, 5-ASA and SCG did not show a significant
      influence on clinical and laboratory parameters of disease in IgAN; other trials 
      with increased dosages are warranted to definitely ascertain the possible
      therapeutic role of these drugs in IgAN.

TI  - Nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease: current status and future
      directions.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally 
      (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also 
      as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of 
      remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when
      compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and
      preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the
      preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or
      superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets 
      for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an
      elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in
      acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than
      polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel 
      rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal
      nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support
      achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's
      disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients
      with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective
      therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term
      remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective
      evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal
      nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal
      nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly
      retard production of inflammatory mediators.

TI  - Diet and inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - We conducted a population-based case-control study of inflammatory bowel disease 
      and dietary habits in Stockholm during 1984-1987. We obtained retrospective
      information about food intake 5 years previously by a postal questionnaire for
      152 cases with Crohn's disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305
      controls. The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects who had
      a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative risk = 2.6, 95%
      confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased for subjects who had a high (15 
      gm or more per day) intake of fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval
      = 0.3-0.9). The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption of fast foods:
      the relative risk associated with consumption of fast foods at least two times a 
      week was estimated at 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease
      and 3.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis. Although
      coffee seemed to provide a protective effect for both diseases, there are reasons
      to consider this finding an artifact.

AB  - To examine socioeconomic factors, dietary and other personal habits, and medical 
      history as risk factors for ulcerative colitis, we studied 167 (98%) of all
      prevalent cases of ulcerative colitis diagnosed in Uppsala county from 1945 to
      1964 and 167 age and sex matched population controls. Ulcerative colitis patients
      were less likely than controls to be current cigarette, pipe, or cigar smokers
      (odds ratio (OR) = 0.44; 95% confidence limits (CL) = 0.25-0.78), but more likely
      to have symptoms induced by drinking milk (OR = 4.63; 95% CL = 2.15-9.93).
      Patients with ulcerative colitis do not differ in most of the socioeconomic,
      dietary and personal habits compared with the background population.

TI  - Incorporation of fatty acids from fish oil and olive oil into colonic mucosal
      lipids and effects upon eicosanoid synthesis in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1151-5
AB  - The incorporation of the fatty acids in fish and olive oil into the colonic
      mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was examined during 12 weeks' 
      dietary supplementation with the oils, and the influence on colonic mucosal
      prostaglandin and thromboxane generation was measured. With a dietary supplement 
      of 18 g fish oil daily, concentrations of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids
      in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were significantly
      raised in mucosal lipids. The first time these were measured, after three weeks' 
      supplementation, the mean increases in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid 
      were seven fold and 1.5 fold respectively, and these increases were maintained
      during the 12 week study. Arachidonic acid values fell throughout the study and
      this reduction was significant at 12 weeks. Mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
      thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis were suppressed, and 
      this reached significance (p less than 0.05) at three and 12 weeks for PGE2 and
      at 12 weeks for thromboxane B2. The predominant fatty acid in olive oil is oleic 
      acid. Supplementation with 18 g/day resulted in a significant increase in oleic
      acid in colonic mucosa at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05) and a fall in stearic acid 
      and docosahexaenoic acid; there was no significant change in eicosanoid
      synthesis. It is concluded that colonic lipids and prostaglandin and thromboxane 
      synthesis can be readily altered by dietary supplementation with fish oil. The
      extent of incorporation of the fatty acids present in oils is dependent upon the 
      individual fatty acid.

TI  - Comparison of oral cefpodoxime proxetil and penicillin V potassium in the
      treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis. The Cefpodoxime
      Pharyngitis Study Group.
PG  - 579-88
AB  - Ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis due to
      Streptococcus pyogenes were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of cefpodoxime
      proxetil orally with food every 12 hours or 250 mg of penicillin V potassium
      orally on an empty stomach every six hours. Treatment efficacy was evaluated in
      30 cefpodoxime-treated and 33 penicillin-treated patients. After 10 days of
      treatment, S pyogenes was eradicated from the throat culture in 29 of the 30
      cefpodoxime-treated patients and in 30 of the 33 penicillin-treated patients.
      Twenty days after treatment termination, infection recurred in one patient of
      each treatment group. Clinical cure or improvement was found in 97% of the
      patients in each group. Adverse medical events occurred in nine of the 48
      cefpodoxime-treated patients and in four of the 45 penicillin-treated patients;
      these were probably related to the study drug in seven and two patients,
      respectively. The most common adverse events were nausea (in three cefpodoxime
      and one penicillin patient) and diarrhea (in three and two). No patient showed
      colitis related to Clostridium difficile. No clinically significant abnormal
      laboratory test results were found in either treatment group. It is concluded
      that cefpodoxime proxetil is as effective and safe as penicillin V potassium in
      the treatment of pharyngitis due to S pyogenes.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: primary health care management of ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 27-30, 35-6, 38-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, two conditions so alike clinically that they are frequently
      indistinguishable from one another. Inflammatory bowel disease occurs at a rate
      of approximately five per 100,000 people. It tends to cluster in families and is 
      seen four to five times more often in Jewish Caucasians than in other Caucasians.
      The etiology is unknown. Increasing attention is being paid to autoimmune
      factors, genetic factors and food allergies, and the notion that inflammatory
      bowel disease has its roots in a psychological disorder continues to pale for
      want of empirically sound evidence. Disease pattern is one of remission and
      exacerbation. The aim of therapy is to maintain an optimal lifestyle in remission
      through an individually tailored protocol of medications. Sulfasalazine remains
      the medication of choice; corticosteroids have short-term utility in
      exacerbation; and immunosuppressants, though controversial, are thought to have
      some steroid-sparing benefits during acute flare-ups. Indications for surgery
      vary, depending on whether or not a clear differential diagnosis has been made
      between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There is no cure for inflammatory
      bowel disease except for total colectomy in clearly diagnosed ulcerative colitis.
      Current research endeavors seek a cause or causes for inflammatory bowel disease,
      but the literature does not solidly support any one possibility above other rival
      etiologies.

PG  - 338-43
AB  - An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis at a Minnesota junior
      high school in October 1988 comprised 32 cases among 1562 students (attack rate, 
      2.0%). Four children were hospitalized; none developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
      Case children were more likely than controls to have eaten heat-processed meat
      patties (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-20.1; P less than .001) in
      the school cafeteria on a specific day. The minimum estimated attack rate among
      students who ate these patties was 8%. The patties should have been sufficiently 
      cooked by the manufacturer to destroy enteric pathogens before they were frozen
      and distributed. E. coli were cultured from frozen patties that were manufactured
      at the same plant on the same dates as the implicated patties, but serotype
      O157:H7 was not isolated. Heat-processed meat patties may serve as vehicles for
      E. coli O157:H7 infection, and currently there are no federal or state regulatory
      standards to ensure the safety of these products.

TI  - Mesalazine release from coated tablets: effect of dietary fibre.
PG  - 248-50
AB  - Delayed-release mesalazine formulations relay on pH-dependent coat dissolution to
      ensure delivery of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) to the colon. As dietary fibre
      acidifies the colonic lumen we have studied the effect of fibre supplementation
      in 10 patients with quiescent colitis. Greater intake of dietary fibre was
      associated with a decrease in stool pH and an increase in stool frequency and
      faecal mass. However, the 24 h faecal and urinary excretion of 5-ASA and
      N-acetyl-5-ASA was unchanged. The percentage of total faecal ASA excreted as
      N-acetyl-5-ASA correlated with whole-gut transit time, suggesting that prolonged 
      transit may be disadvantageous to patients with colitis as N-acetyl-5-ASA appears
      to be inactive.

PG  - 747-50
AB  - The efficiency of ispaghula husk in relieving gastrointestinal symptoms in
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission was studied in a placebo-controlled
      trial running for 4 months. Twenty-nine patients (81%) completed the trial; four 
      withdrew after colitis relapse (three while receiving placebo). Grading of
      symptoms judged ispaghula to be consistently superior to placebo (p less than
      0.001) and associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement (69%) than 
      placebo (24%) (p less than 0.001). The results show that ispaghula can be helpful
      in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms in quiescent ulcerative colitis.

PG  - 609-23
AB  - The etiology and specific treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      unknown, and the treatment strategy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      is essentially symptomatic and supportive. The malnutrition that frequently
      accompanies inflammatory bowel disease is a manifestation of intestinal failure
      and should be vigorously corrected with total parenteral nutrition, elemental
      diets, or both. Evidence exists for the value of total parenteral nutrition and
      elemental diets as primary therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in selected
      patients. Judicious nutritional therapy remains a cornerstone in the adjunctive
      management of these patients.

OAB - In view of the significant and articulate minority view among pediatricians that 
      breast feeding is not "worth the bother" in developed countries, this review of
      the literature delves into the evidence from both developed and developing
      countries for the advantages of breastfeeding, both in infants and for long-term 
      health. Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate
      and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily
      respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is
      4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants.
      Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a
      Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies.
      Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis
      in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths
      occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight
      babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where
      bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 
      for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S.
      breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term
      health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease,
      ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease,
      malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.
      The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the
      possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

TI  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 and its significance in foods.
PG  - 289-301
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 was conclusively identified as a pathogen in 1982
      following its association with two food-related outbreaks of an unusual
      gastrointestinal illness. The organism is now recognized as an important cause of
      foodborne disease, with outbreaks reported in the U.S.A., Canada, and the United 
      Kingdom. Illness is generally quite severe, and can include three different
      syndromes, i.e., hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura. Most outbreaks have been associated with eating
      undercooked ground beef or, less frequently, drinking raw milk. Surveys of retail
      raw meats and poultry revealed E. coli O157:H7 in 1.5 to 3.5% of ground beef,
      pork, poultry, and lamb. Dairy cattle, especially young animals, have been
      identified as a reservoir. The organism is typical of most E. coli, but does
      possess distinguishing characteristics. For example, E. coli O157:H7 does not
      ferment sorbitol within 24 h, does not possess beta-glucuronidase activity, and
      does not grow well or at all at 44-45.5 degrees C. The organism has no unusual
      heat resistance; heating ground beef sufficiently to kill typical strains of
      salmonellae will also kill E. coli O157:H7. The mechanism of pathogenicity has
      not been fully elucidated, but clinical isolates produce one or more verotoxins
      which are believed to be important virulence factors. Little is known about the
      significance of pre-formed verotoxins in foods. The use of proper hygienic
      practices in handling foods of animal origin and proper heating of such foods
      before consumption are important control measures for the prevention of E. coli
      O157:H7 infections.

TI  - Olsalazine. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 647-64
AB  - Olsalazine (sodium azodisalicylate; azodisal sodium) is an anti-inflammatory
      agent designed to deliver its active moiety, mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid;
      mesalamine), to the colon while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the 
      use of a sulfapyridine carrier. As a prodrug, olsalazine is an effective oral
      treatment for both active ulcerative colitis and for maintenance of disease
      remission and may possibly be of benefit in patients with Crohn's colitis.
      Findings from both short and long term noncomparative and comparative studies
      demonstrate that olsalazine 1 to 3g daily in divided doses improves clinical
      signs and symptoms of colitis in approximately 60 to 80% of patients with acute
      ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity. This improvement rate was
      similar to that obtained with sulfasalazine. Lower doses of olsalazine, usually
      1g daily in divided doses, also maintained remission in patients with chronic
      ulcerative colitis. While olsalazine effectively delivers mesalazine to the
      colon, the prodrug itself increases net luminal water secretion and accelerates
      gastrointestinal transit of a meal. The resulting diarrhoea (occurring in
      approximately 17% of patients and resulting in withdrawal from therapy in 6% of
      patients) is distinguishable from that associated with inflammatory bowel disease
      by the high water content and the absence of blood. Olsalazine-induced diarrhoea 
      usually occurred soon after initiation of olsalazine therapy or dosage increase, 
      was more frequent with higher doses and was usually transient. Dosage reduction, 
      increases in frequency of dosing and concomitant administration with food reduced
      the severity in many patients with persistent olsalazine-induced diarrhoea. With 
      the exception of diarrhoea, olsalazine was generally well tolerated. Fewer than
      14% of patients allergic to or intolerant of sulfasalazine had similar reactions 
      to olsalazine. Olsalazine appears to be a suitable therapy for the treatment of
      first attacks as well as acute exacerbation of mild to moderate acute ulcerative 
      colitis, and for the maintenance of remission in patients with chronic ulcerative
      colitis.

TI  - The use of plasmid profiles and nucleic acid probes in epidemiologic
      investigations of foodborne, diarrheal diseases.
PG  - 77-89
AB  - The application of nucleic acid analyses to investigations of infectious disease 
      outbreaks has resulted in useful molecular strain markers that distinguish the
      epidemic clone of a particular pathogen and help identify specific vehicles of
      infection. We have successfully used plasmid profile analysis, restriction
      endonuclease digestion of plasmid and whole-cell DNAs, and nucleic acid
      hybridization to investigate recent outbreaks of foodborne diarrheal illness.
      Plasmid analysis has been important in identifying epidemic strains of Salmonella
      enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7. In a culture survey of S. enteritidis
      isolates from humans and a variety of animals, including chickens and chicken
      eggs, we identified 16 distinct plasmid profiles and used these to differentiate 
      strains, especially within commonly occurring phage types (Colindale 8 and 13a). 
      HindIII digests of plasmid DNA were useful in distinguishing plasmids of similar 
      mass but dissimilar enzyme target sequences; they clearly distinguished S.
      enteritidis strains causing systemic infections in children in parts of Africa
      from U.S. isolates. Investigations of outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis have also 
      been assisted by plasmid analysis. Restriction endonuclease digests of whole-cell
      DNA and Southern blot analysis, hybridizing with E. coli 16S and 23S rRNA
      (ribotyping), have been effective subtyping techniques, especially for
      plasmidless isolates of Campylobacter jejuni. In five outbreaks of C. jejuni
      infections, ribotyping of PvuII and ClaI digests distinguished individual
      epidemic strains within one commonly occurring C. jejuni serotype (Penner 2, Lior
      4). Preliminary data show that ribotyping of NcoI digests can also distinguish
      individual epidemic strains of E. coli O157:H7 and may provide a more stable
      marker than plasmid profiles. Specific DNA probes derived from cloned virulence
      genes of E. coli have been invaluable in epidemic investigations and surveys.
      Using colony hybridization, we found in one survey of stool specimens from 174
      dairy cattle that 11% of animals were asymptomatically carrying Shiga-like
      toxigenic E. coli other than O157:H7. We also found that newly synthesized
      oligonucleotide probes for the Shiga-like toxins I and II agreed 100% with cloned
      gene probes in a study of 613 E. coli strains. Future studies of these organisms 
      will include the use of additional synthetic oligonucleotides as primers to
      amplify the toxin genes directly in patient and animal specimens by the
      polymerase chain reaction. There is a continuing and expanding role for molecular
      approaches in epidemiological investigations. The DNA methods described above are
      not based on the often complex expression of phenotypic characteristics, and,
      unlike sensitive and specific techniques such as phage typing, a single method
      can be used to study a variety of Gram-positive and negative bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Serum copper, zinc, selenium, magnesium, calcium, cholesterol, triglyceride and
      retinol contents were determined in 11 patients with ulcerative colitis and in 20
      healthy volunteers. Lipid and retinol loadings were performed as well. No
      differences were found in serum copper, zinc, calcium and selenium levels between
      the groups. Serum magnesium levels were somewhat lower in the patients than in
      the volunteers. During the period of loading, cholesterol levels did not differ
      between the two groups at any time. Triglyceride levels except for two persons,
      were higher in patients. Triglyceride curves showed pathological courses in each 
      case. Retinol concentrations in patients remained below the values observed in
      volunteers. Data suggest a disturbed utilization of fat and retinol in patients
      with ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Absence of effect on faecal microflora of long-term supplementation of dietary
      fibres in juvenile ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - In a long-term double-blind cross-over study, ten patients aged 10-18 years with 
      juvenile ulcerative colitis were studied before and after six months
      supplementation of dietary fibre (wheat fibre and ispaghula). All patients had
      been in remission for 0.5 to 2 years and orally treated with sulfasalazine, but
      none were taking steroids. The type of fibre intake was randomized and the
      periods separated by a 6-month wash-out period with placebo. The average intake
      of both wheat fibre and ispaghula was 16 g per day. Faecal samples were collected
      before and after each fibre period and analysed by quantitative and qualitative
      microbiological techniques. No significant changes in bacterial species were
      found in the faecal microflora. The results indicate that effects of fibre on
      human metabolism in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with sulfasalazine
      are not mediated by changes in the intestinal microflora.

TI  - Serum bile acids in relation to disease activity and intake of dietary fibers in 
      juvenile ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 162-9
AB  - Serum concentrations of primary bile acids were determined at different disease
      activities in juvenile ulcerative colitis and in healthy age-matched controls. In
      patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission, serum levels of bile
      acids were also studied after long-term intake (6 months) of dietary fibers
      (wheat fiber and ispaghula, respectively) in a double-blind randomized cross-over
      study. Blood samples were taken in the morning after an overnight fasting and for
      4 h postprandially after a standardized test meal. Determinations of bile acids
      were made by radioimmunoassays. Patients with total colitis in the active phase
      had significantly higher serum levels of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids 4 h
      postprandially compared with control children. After long-term intake of
      ispaghula, significantly higher (although not different from controls) serum
      levels of cholic acid were found 2 and 3 h postprandially, whereas wheat fibers
      did not affect serum bile acid concentrations. These results may suggest an
      increased absorption of unconjugated bile acids in the diseased colon and a
      minimal influence of dietary fibers on serum bile acid concentrations.
