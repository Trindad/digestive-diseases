PG  - S89-98
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) is an inductible isoenzyme of cyclooxygenase undetectable
      in normal colonic mucosa and overexpressed in 80% colonic tumor. Several works in
      vitro and in vivo showed that Cox2 plays a key role in the multistep process of
      colorectal tumorigenesis such apoptosis inhibition of cellular proliferation and 
      angiogenesis induction. So that Cox2 represent a potential molecular target in
      colorectal management and specific Cox2 inhibitors may be useful as
      chemopreventive as well as therapeutic agent in humans. In animals study Cox2
      inhibitors was shown to be effective and in humans Cox2 inhibitors are approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration as an adjunct to endoscopic surveillance and 
      surgery in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). The purpose of
      this article is to review the relationship between Cox2\Cox2 inhibitors and
      differents signaling pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis and to precise their
      possible molecular mechanisms of action. This work although review clinicals data
      of their efficacy as chemopreventive agent as well as therapeutic in the
      differents group at risk for colorectal cancer.

TI  - [Eosinophilic colitis. A report of two cases with non conventional treatment].
PG  - 231-5
AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is a rare entity of unknown etiology characterized by
      diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis includes
      histopathological infiltration of more than 20 eosinophils in colon. It is
      frequently associated with milk hypersensitivity and, less usual, with other
      foods and increased IgE. Histopthological appearance of eosinophil mediators has 
      been observed in the gut. It is sometimes related to the degree of infiltration
      of eosinophils in the gut as well as to the disease severity. There is not an
      established treatment for this entity, although systemic steroids have been used 
      with certain efficacy. However, there is a recurrence of the symptoms when the
      therapy stops, besides the well known side effects of the long-term use of
      steroids. Cromolyn inhibits mast cell degranulation and prevents liberation of
      mediators. It is successful in certain cases, specially the severe ones. However,
      it is not available for its use in our country. Ketotifen, as last resource in
      our patients with bad response to habitual treatment and restriction diet, was
      used. Although its use is controversial, we consider that stabilizing mast cell
      membrane with subsequent inhibition of degranulation and recruitment of
      eosinophils to sites of inflammation, would also restrain histamine liberation
      and blockage of H1 receptors, which would diminish local damage induced by
      eosinophils. Nonetheless ketotifen mechanism of action is unknown, our patients
      improved after treatment with this drug.

TI  - Assessment of mucosal inflammation and blood flow in response to four weeks'
      intervention with probiotics in patients operated with a J-configurated
      ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA).
PG  - 1228-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition in patients operated 
      on with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA). A disturbed mucosal perfusion in the
      pouch has been suggested as a possible cause. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has
      been used successfully to measure gastric and colonic mucosal perfusion in
      humans. In a previous study, we demonstrated a reduced mucosal perfusion in the
      distal part of the pouch, during probiotic intervention, examined by LDF
      measurement. The aim of the present study was to confirm our previous results in 
      a much larger material, and to compare the results of LDF measurements and
      inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with those in familial 
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. METHODS: Five hundred millilitres of a
      fermented milk product (Cultura), containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and
      bifidobacteria (Bb-12), was given daily for 4 weeks to 41 UC and 10 patients with
      FAP, operated on with IPAA. Mucosal perfusion was measured with LDF and the
      degree of inflammation was examined at predefined levels of the distal bowel by
      histology and faecal calprotectin measurements both before and after
      intervention. We also evaluated the applicability of a Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index (PDAI). RESULTS: The LDF measurements were reproducible in the pelvic pouch
      at each of the predefined levels, but did not change during intervention. Mucosal
      perfusion was significantly reduced in the distal compared to the proximal part
      of the pouch in the UC group (P < 0.05). The perfusion levels were higher in the 
      FAP patients compared to the UC patientsat all predefined levels (P < 0.05).
      Calprotectin levels and histological score did not change significantlyafter
      intervention in any of the groups. The calprotectin level was significantly lower
      in the FAP compared to the UC group both before and after intervention. The PDAI 
      decreased in both groups from alevel considered diagnostic for pouchitis to a
      level considered as not active pouchitis. The decreasewas significant for the UC 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results did not demonstrate an effect of probiotics on
      histology, although a significant effect on the PDAI was achieved, which concurs 
      with the previously reported effect on symptoms and endoscopic score. The
      significantly reduced blood flow in the UC group compared to the FAP group,
      operated on with the same procedure, and the significantly increased calprotectin
      levels in the UC group, are original findings. Both findings may be related to an
      increased risk for pouchitis among UC patients. The lack of effect of
      intervention on mucosal perfusion does not exclude a role for reduced circulation
      as a cause of pouchitis based on the reduced LDF measurements in the distal part 
      of the pouch.

PG  - 99-111; discussion 111-4, 211-8
AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics are the sort of therapy that most patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) wish for. They are without significant side
      effects, except possibly an increase in gas with prebiotics, and so far, appear
      to be entirely safe. However, are they effective? More than a dozen studies using
      probiotics in IBD have now been reported, and there is dear benefit in pouchitis 
      and possibly also in Crohn's, although there are so many clinical types of this
      condition that a clear indication has yet to emerge. For ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      more studies are needed. The use of prebiotics in IBD is only just starting,
      although significant effects on both the luminal and mucosa-associated flora have
      been demonstrated in healthy subjects. Antibiotics offer more certain hope in IBD
      treatment, although with a much greater risk of unwanted effects. Their efficacy 
      in clinical studies varies, with Crohn's disease and pouchitis reporting more
      benefit than ulcerative colitis. However, the ideal combination of antibiotics,
      and rationale for their use has not been determined.

PG  - 2241-6
AB  - Ulcerative colitis seldom associated with nutritive and/or salicylate allergy.
      Authors present a case of both allergic events at the course of the disease. In
      1996 a 19-year-old girl was referred with a history of blood in stool as well as 
      diarrhoea, suggesting ulcerative proctitis. Biopsy revealed ulcerative colitis of
      the rectum mucosa with eosinophilic infiltration and 20% peripheral eosinophilia 
      was found. Allergic origin and worm infection were ruled out, and after tinidazol
      treatment, four year elapsed without any signs or symptoms. In December 2000
      blood in stools and upper abdominal complaints developed without peripheral
      eosinophilia. Gastroscopy and biopsy showed a mild chronic gastritis. Olsalazine,
      budesonide enema and famotidin treatment were started, but then later changed to 
      mesalazine and pantoprazol, because of the constant stomach complaints. The next 
      five months passed without any symptoms. The patient had to break off her
      seashore journey in July 2000 because of stomach complaints, vomiting and
      exsiccosis. Peripheral eosinophilia (27.3%) was evident. Gastroscopy revealed
      erosive ulcers and the biopsy showed eosinophilic gastritis. Biopsies from the
      jejunum, duodenum and antrum as well as enteroscopy and biopsies from the rectum 
      showed mild eosinophilic infiltration. An allergy test proved the presence of IgE
      against salicylate, egg protein, seafood protein and the lymphocyte
      transformation test was also positive against salicylate. Oral food challenges
      proved to be negative and the amino-salicylate treatment was stopped. After a
      temporary symptom free period, bloody stools reappeared in May 2003; the
      peripheral eosinophilia still existed, but had decreased (22.2%). Esomeprazol,
      and methyl-prednisolone containing enema (40 mg/day/2 weeks) followed by
      budesonide enema twice a week resulted in a symptom free period and peripheral
      eosinophilia became almost normalised (6.2%). The authors report a case having
      ulcerative proctitis first, than nutritive and salicylate allergy with
      eosinophilic gastritis and a proctitis flare-up thereafter.

      infections, gastro-oesophageal reflux, eosinophilic oesophagitis, eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis, allergic colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Recently,
      clinical and experimental studies have provided evidence that eosinophils have a 
      critical role in the pathophysiology of eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal
      disease. Collectively, these studies have provided relevant insight into
      identifying key targets for therapeutic intervention. The present review
      describes recent experimental investigations on the role of eosinophils in the
      clinical manifestations of eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disease and
      discusses future therapeutic approaches for the treatment of disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: dysfunction of GALT and gut bacterial flora (I).
PG  - 63-75
AB  - Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ in the body. 
      This is not surprising considering the huge load of antigens (Ags) from food and 
      commensal bacteria with which it interacts on a daily basis. Gut-associated
      lymphoid tissue has to recognise and allow the transfer of beneficial Ags whilst 
      concurrently dealing with and successfully removing putative and overtly harmful 
      Ags. This distinctive biological feature of GALT is believed to be crucial to
      good health. Deregulation or dysfunction of GALT is thought to predispose to
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      The exact mechanism(s) underlying the pathogenesis of IBD is (are) poorly
      understood and the immunological defects in GALT are poorly documented. Advances 
      in immunology have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells (DCs), which are
      the key Ag presenting cells in tissues and lymphoid compartments. Their crucial
      role in GALT, in health and disease is discussed in this review. Interaction of
      DCs with T cells in the gut produces a subset of T lymphocytes, which have
      immunosuppressive function. Inappropriate Ag uptake and presentation to naive T
      cells in mesenteric lymph nodes may lead to T cell tolerance in GALT. These
      various complex factors in the gut are discussed and their possible relevance to 
      IBD evaluated.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: dysfunction of GALT and gut bacterial flora (II).
PG  - 125-36
AB  - The precise cause(s) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown. From 
      animal models and human studies it is well established that gut bacterial flora
      are essential for inducing the bowel inflammation. Animal models, when kept in a 
      germ-free environment, do not develop colitis until the gut flora is
      reconstituted. It is not clear whether the bacterial antigens (Ags) from the
      normal flora or some other pathogenic bacterial Ags induce/propagate the
      inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite extensive
      research it has not been possible to identify any specific bacteria or virus as a
      credible cause of IBD. Recent understanding of quorum sensing molecules (QSMs)
      secreted by bacteria helps to explain the community behaviour in bacterial
      species. When QSMs reach a defined concentration, they activate bacterial
      proliferation and a number of virulence genes. Also, these molecules have been
      found to modulate the immune system to the advantage of the gut bacteria. They
      have not been well studied, however, in the gut. Inappropriate secretion of QSMs 
      may alter the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and, thereby, deregulate the 
      immune tolerance normally present. Usefulness of probiotics and their immune
      modulating effects are being increasingly reported. Probiotics are also being
      used in the treatment of IBD. The interaction between the epithelial cells and
      the gut flora is very important as this is the first line of contact; this
      interaction may determine the induction of tolerance and mucosal integrity or
      immune activity, tissue inflammation and abnormal permeability. The latter is
      documented in patients with IBD and their healthy relatives. This may be an
      important factor in disruption of mucosal integrity and GALT dysfunction.

TI  - Randomized placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk on active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1133-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are efficacious for treating and maintaining remission of 
      ulcerative colitis. AIM: To conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk supplementation as a dietary adjunct in treating
      active ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate,
      active, ulcerative colitis randomly received 100 mL/day of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk or placebo for 12 weeks with conventional
      treatment. RESULTS: Clinical and endoscopic activity indices and histological
      scores were similar in the two groups before treatment. Although improvements
      were significant in both groups, the clinical activity index was significantly
      lower in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk than in the placebo group after
      treatment. The post-treatment endoscopic activity index and histological score
      were significantly reduced in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but not the
      placebo group. Increases in faecal butyrate, propionate and short-chain fatty
      acid concentrations were significant in the bifidobacteria-fermented milk, but
      not the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed in either group.
      CONCLUSION: Supplementation with this bifidobacteria-fermented milk product is
      safe and more effective than conventional treatment alone, suggesting possible
      beneficial effects in managing active ulcerative colitis. This is a pilot study
      and further larger studies are required to confirm the result these preliminary
      results.

TI  - [Environmental factors in the etiopathology of inflammatory bowel syndrome].
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a
      tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has
      increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development
      and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory
      (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors.
      Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive
      enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are
      impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of
      secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine,
      somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal 
      mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and
      activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet,
      smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are
      jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined
      dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances
      in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.

TI  - Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison with soy oil.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty
      acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to
      compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with
      IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had
      ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was
      self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. 
      RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the
      duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035),
      intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease
      activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the
      effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for
      the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment
      suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint
      pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition.
      Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid 
      to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on
      IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).

TI  - Characterization of breast milk received by infants with gross blood in stools.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to ascertain factors that might be
      protective of the appearance of gross blood in the stools of breast-fed infants. 
      METHODS: Logistic regression models were formed to search for variables possibly 
      explaining the condition. In addition to the analyzed breast milk factors,
      mother's allergic disease was introduced into the models to control for its
      possible confounding effect. The breast milk samples, collected from mothers of
      infants with gross blood in stools (n = 23) and from mothers of healthy
      age-matched infants (n = 71), were analyzed for concentrations of transforming
      growth factor-beta2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10,
      prostaglandin (PG)E2, cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) and fatty acid
      composition. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Increase in the concentrations of PGE2 and 
      Cys-LTs in the breast milk together with mother's allergic disease reduced the
      likelihood of gross blood in stools in the breast-fed infant. The results suggest
      that no single factor, but a combination of immunomodulatory factors may protect 
      the child from gross blood in the stools of breast-fed infants. Allergic disease 
      was not a risk factor as mother's allergic disease appeared to counterbalance the
      gross blood in stools. Due to the preliminary nature of the study, the results
      need to be verified in a larger setting. The challenge for the future lies in
      identifying of such active compounds for dietary modification to enforce
      particularly the properties of the breast milk which are immunoprotective for the
      infant and to reduce the likelihood of intestinal disorders in at risk infants.

TI  - Medical therapy for ulcerative colitis: the state of the art and beyond.
PG  - 488-95
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the large
      intestine. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of UC have
      led to the development of novel treatments for this often debilitating condition.
      Aside from aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, drugs that have been used for
      decades in the treatment of UC, biologic agents, in addition to medications
      targeting specific effector mechanisms involved in the inflammatory cascade, have
      been used in patients with UC with varying degrees of success. Clinicians have
      never had as many therapeutic options for UC as they do today. Herein we review
      the variety of treatment options, both standard and investigational, that are
      available for patients with UC.

TI  - Low-dose balsalazide plus a high-potency probiotic preparation is more effective 
      than balsalazide alone or mesalazine in the treatment of acute mild-to-moderate
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - PI126-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Balsalazide is well tolerated and effective in treating acute
      ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 is a probiotic cocktail proven to be effective in
      preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis. We compared the efficacy and safety of
      low-dose balsalazide (2.25 g/day) plus 3 g/day VLS#3 (group A) with medium-dose
      balsalazide alone (group B) and with mesalazine (group C) in the treatment of
      mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: Ninety patients (30
      per group) were randomly enrolled, with a treatment duration of 8 weeks. Efficacy
      was assessed by symptoms assessment, endoscopic appearance, and histological
      evaluation. RESULTS: Balsalazide/VSL#3 was significantly superior to balsalazide 
      alone and to mesalazine in obtaining remission: 24 patients of group A were in
      remission [per-protocol: 85.71% (C.I.95%: 62-96), on intention-to-treat: 80%
      (C.I.95%: 59-91)], while 21 group B [per-protocol: 80.77% (C.I. 95%: 51-82), on
      intention-to-treat: 77% (C.I.95%: 43-81)] and 16 group C patients [per-protocol: 
      72.73% (C.I. 95%: 30-75), on intention-to-treat: 53.33% (C.I.95%: 42-62)] were in
      remission (p<0.02). Balsalazide with or without VSL#3 was better tolerated than
      mesalazine: two group C patients were withdrawn from the study because of severe 
      side-effects; 1 group A (3.33%), 3 group B (10%) and 4 group C (13.33%) patients 
      experienced slight side-effects. The balsalazide/VSL#3 combination was faster in 
      obtaining remission than balsalazide alone or mesalazine (4, 7.5, and 13 days in 
      groups A, B and C, respectively) and also better in improving all parameters
      evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Balsalazide/VSL#3 may be a very good choice in the
      treatment of active mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis instead of
      balsalazide alone or mesalazine.

TI  - Management of pouch dysfunction or pouchitis with an ileoanal pouch.
PG  - 993-1006
AB  - Pouchitis, a non-specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir, is the most
      frequent long-term complication after pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis.
      Incidence rates vary widely. The etiology is still unknown, but genetic
      susceptibility and fecal stasis with bacterial overgrowth seem to be important
      factors. A clinical diagnosis should be always confirmed by endoscopy and
      histology, and Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI), based on clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic appearance and histologic findings, represents an objective 
      and reproducible scoring system for pouchitis. The treatment of pouchitis is
      largely empiric given the few controlled studies available. Antibiotics,
      especially metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are the therapy of choice. Chronic
      pouchitis occurs in about 10-15% of patients; in these cases, further diagnostic 
      tests should be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses. Highly concentrated
      probiotics (VSL#3) have been shown to be effective in preventing the onset and
      relapse of pouchitis.

TI  - Probiotics and medical nutrition therapy.
PG  - 56-68
AB  - Probiotics have been defined by The Food Agricultural Organization/World Health
      Organization (FAO/WHO) as "live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." They have been used for
      centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of
      probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal
      recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of
      English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship 
      between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been
      reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include
      diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune
      function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive,
      hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary
      tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further
      investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these
      medical conditions.

TI  - Maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis with the probiotic Escherichia coli
      Nissle 1917 is as effective as with standard mesalazine.
PG  - 1617-23
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence exists for the pathogenic role of the enteric flora
      in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics contain living microorganisms which
      exert health effects on the host. We compared the efficacy in maintaining
      remission of the probiotic preparation Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and
      established therapy with mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: In total, 327 patients were recruited and assigned to a double
      blind, double dummy trial to receive either the probiotic drug 200 mg once daily 
      (n = 162) or mesalazine 500 mg three times daily (n = 165). The study lasted for 
      12 months and patients were assessed by clinical and endoscopic activity indices 
      (Rachmilewitz) as well as by histology. The primary aim of the study was to
      confirm equivalent efficacy of the two drugs in the prevention of relapses.
      RESULTS: The per protocol analysis revealed relapses in 40/110 (36.4%) patients
      in the E coli Nissle 1917 group and 38/112 (33.9%) in the mesalazine group
      (significant equivalence p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses showed no differences
      between the treatment groups in terms of duration and localisation of disease or 
      pretrial treatment. Safety profile and tolerability were very good for both
      groups and were not different. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic drug E coli Nissle 1917
      shows efficacy and safety in maintaining remission equivalent to the gold
      standard mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. The effectiveness of
      probiotic treatment further underlines the pathogenetic significance of the
      enteric flora.

TI  - Comparative composition of bacteria in the human intestinal microflora during
      remission and active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a severe, relapsing and remitting disease of the human
      large intestine characterised by inflammation of the mucosa and submucosa. The
      main site of disease is the sigmoid/rectal region of the large bowel but the
      aetiology remains unknown. There is considerable evidence to indicate that the
      components of the resident colonic microflora can play an important role in
      initiation of the disease. The present study was aimed at characterising the
      faecal microflora of ulcerative colitis patients in remission and active phases
      to determine profile differences. Faecal samples were obtained from 12 patients, 
      6 with active colitis and 6 in remission. The samples were analysed for
      populations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, clostridia, bacteroides,
      sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and total bacteria using culture independent
      fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Lactobacillus-specific denaturing
      gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was then performed to compare the species
      present. Numbers of lactobacilli were significantly lower (p<0.05) during the
      active phase of the disease but the other populations tested did not differ. DGGE
      analysis revealed that Lactobacillus salivarus, Lactobacillus manihotivorans and 
      Pediococcus acidilactici were present in remission, but not during active
      inflammation. These results imply that a reduction in intestinal Lactobacillus
      species may be important in the initiation of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Culture of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis from the blood of
      patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1039-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, resembles some
      aspects of tuberculosis, leprosy, and paratuberculosis. The role of Mycobacterium
      avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      METHODS: We tested for MAP by PCR and culture in buffy coat preparations from 28 
      individuals with Crohn's disease, nine with ulcerative colitis, and 15 without
      inflammatory bowel disease. FINDINGS: MAP DNA in uncultured buffy coats was
      identified by PCR in 13 (46%) individuals with Crohn's disease, four (45%) with
      ulcerative colitis, and three (20%) without inflammatory bowel disease. Viable
      MAP was cultured from the blood of 14 (50%) patients with Crohn's disease, two
      (22%) with ulcerative colitis, and none of the individuals without inflammatory
      bowel disease. Current use of immunosuppressive medication did not correlate with
      a positive MAP culture. Sequencing of PCR products from MAP cultures confirmed
      the presence of the MAP-specific IS900 fragment. Among 11 MAP isolates assessed, 
      we identified nine strains that were not identical. INTERPRETATION: We detected
      viable MAP in peripheral blood in a higher proportion of individuals with Crohn's
      disease than in controls. These data contribute to the evidence that MAP might be
      a cause of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Bacterial colonization and the development of intestinal defences.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - In humans, intestinal defences develop during gestation and, at full term, have
      the capacity to respond in an appropriate manner to infectious agents and foreign
      antigens. Before an active protective response can occur, however, the gut must
      first be exposed to colonizing bacteria. Colonization with diverse intestinal
      microbes is necessary for the development of important gut defenses such as the
      synthesis and secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A and the generation of a
      balanced T helper (Th) cell response. Insights into normal immune physiological
      development of the gut have been made by studying the germ-free animal and
      intestinal defenses. These studies have provided insights into the physiology of 
      immune responses. Two important immunological functions are the secretion of
      polymeric immunoglobulin A to protect the intestinal surface against harmful
      stimuli and inhibition of the systemic response to commensal bacteria and food
      proteins (eg, oral tolerance) to prevent chronic inflammation. Neither function
      exists in the germ-free state, but rapidly develops after conventionalization
      (colonization) of the germ-free animal. In the present review, the importance of 
      bacterial colonization on the appearance of normal mucosal immune function and to
      the clinical consequences of inadequate colonization to the development of
      disease will be discussed. For example, excessive Th2 activity can lead to atopy,
      whereas Th1 predominance is found in conditions such as Helicobacter pylori
      gastritis and Crohn's disease. With the eradication of infectious diseases in
      developed countries in the past three decades, the incidence of atopic and
      autoimmune diseases has increased. This epidemiological observation has been
      explained by the 'hygiene hypothesis', which suggests that a reduction in
      microbial burden by public health measures has contributed to an immunological
      imbalance in the intestine. A family of pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like 
      receptors) on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells mediates innate immune responses 
      to bacterial molecular patterns and, thereby, orchestrates acquired immunity. As 
      the role of bacterial communication within the gut (bacterial-epithelial
      cross-talk) is clarified, physicians should be able to modulate gut immune
      responses, for example, by the use of probiotics.

TI  - Influence of dietary factors on the clinical course of ulcerative colitis: a
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1479-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      unknown. Dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim 
      of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an
      increased risk of relapse of UC. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was
      performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general
      hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual
      diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index.
      Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised
      into tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using
      multivariate logistic regression, controlling for non-dietary factors. RESULTS: A
      total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per
      cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95%
      confidence intervals (CI) 1.3-7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19
      (95% CI 2.1-12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25-7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71
      (95% CI 1.1-6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of
      relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake. High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI
      1.19-6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08-6.3)) intakes were also associated
      with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood
      of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high
      meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with 
      an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to
      determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the
      likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse
      frequency.

TI  - Probiotics and human health: a clinical perspective.
PG  - 516-26
AB  - There is unequivocal evidence that administration of probiotics could be
      effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea in children and the
      prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and nosocomial/community acquired
      diarrhoea. Encouraging evidence is also emerging for the effectiveness of
      probiotics in the prevention and management of pouchitis and paediatric atopic
      diseases, and the prevention of postoperative infections. There is also strong
      evidence that certain probiotic strains are able to enhance immune function,
      especially in subjects with less than adequate immune function such as the
      elderly. Efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of traveller's diarrhoea,
      sepsis associated with severe acute pancreatitis, and cancers, the management of 
      ulcerative colitis, and lowering of blood cholesterol remains unproven. In
      addition to firm evidence of efficacy (for a range of conditions), major gaps
      exist in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which probiotics modulate
      various physiological functions and the optimum dose, frequency, and duration of 
      treatment for different probiotic strains.

TI  - Potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of haemolytic
      uraemic syndrome in shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli infection.
PG  - 479-82
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause a wide
      spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic carriage through to haemorrhagic
      colitis and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome. There are no current therapeutic
      interventions available in clinical practice that can prevent the development of 
      haemolytic uraemic syndrome. A number of newly developed agents offer the
      potential for the treatment of STEC-associated disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Three
      different classes of agent designed to bind and inactivate shiga toxin have now
      been developed. Synthetic toxin binders, recombinant bacteria and monoclonal
      antibodies provide potentially potent agents that could prevent the development
      of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. These agents have been shown in animal models of 
      STEC disease to be effective. A recent clinical trial of one synthetic toxin
      binder showed no benefit in established haemolytic uraemic syndrome. More potent 
      toxin binders, however, have since been developed and await human clinical
      trials. It is likely to be important that these agents are administered early in 
      the course of disease in order to have maximum efficacy. Although rapid
      diagnostic techniques are available for the diagnosis of STEC disease, they still
      rely on stool culture. SUMMARY: Clinicians need to maintain a high level of
      suspicion of STEC disease as the diagnosis is often made on epidemiological and
      clinical grounds. This will allow potential cases to be identified early and
      treated appropriately.

TI  - Review article: the role of nutrition in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at
      least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal
      role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the
      uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals.
      Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore
      influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes,
      nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response,
      such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition 
      of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence
      cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical
      data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary
      composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both
      children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception
      of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these
      deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological
      significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to
      defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against
      damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These 
      events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as
      in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary
      manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
      and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an
      effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient
      patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary
      therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active
      nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of
      clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Review article: antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - Treatment with antibiotics in inflammatory bowel disease has a long tradition and
      is widely used. The indications for antibiotic therapy are wide ranging, from
      specific situations such as abscesses or fistulae, to patients with severe
      disease (as an unspecific 'protective' measure), and to address the hypothesis
      that the enteric flora as a whole, or specific microorganisms such as
      mycobacteria, are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      best-studied single antibiotic compound is metronidazole. However, overall, the
      scientific basis for the use of antibiotics is limited, which may reflect a lack 
      of interest from sponsors within the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this weak
      evidence base, antibiotics are a globally established therapeutic tool in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Growing evidence from human and animal studies points
      towards a pivotal pathogenetic role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel 
      disease. In view of these experimental findings, clinical trials have been
      undertaken to elucidate the therapeutic effects of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease. Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms which confer
      health benefits to the host by improving the microbial balance of the indigenous 
      microflora. So far, of the many candidates, one specific strain (Escherichia coli
      Nissle 1917) and a mixture of eight different bacteria have demonstrated
      convincing therapeutic efficacy in controlled studies. Maintenance therapy in
      ulcerative colitis and prevention therapy, as well as the treatment of pouchitis,
      have emerged as areas in which probiotic therapy offers a valid therapeutic
      alternative to current treatments. Further investigations may detect additional
      clinically effective probiotics and other clinical indications.

TI  - Review article: bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased incidence of
      osteoporosis. Osteoporosis with osteoporotic pain syndromes, fragility fractures 
      and osteonecrosis accounts for significant morbidity and impacts negatively on
      the quality of life. It is generally agreed that there is a need to increase
      awareness for inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteoporosis. However, the
      best ways in which to identify at-risk patients, the epidemiology of fractures
      and an evidence-based rational prevention strategy remain to be established. The 
      overall prevalence of IBD-associated osteoporosis is 15%, with higher rates seen 
      in older and underweight subjects. The incidence of fractures is about 1 per 100 
      patient years, with fracture rates dramatically increasing with age. While old
      age is a significant risk factor, disease type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative
      colitis) is not related to osteoporosis risk. Corticosteroid use is a major
      variable influencing IBD-associated bone loss; however, it is difficult to
      separate the effects of corticosteroids from those of disease activity. The
      recommendations in inflammatory bowel disease are similar to those for
      postmenopausal osteoporosis, with emphasis on lifestyle modification, vitamin D
      (400-800 IE daily) and calcium (1000-1500 mg daily) supplementation and hormone
      replacement therapy (oestrogens/selective oestrogen receptor modulators in women,
      testosterone in hypogonadal men). Bisphosphonates have been approved for patients
      with osteoporosis (T-score < 2.5), osteoporotic fragility fractures and patients 
      receiving continuous steroid medication. Data on the recently Food and Drug
      Administration-approved osteoanabolic substance parathyroid hormone and on
      osteoprotegerin are promising in terms of both steroid-induced and
      inflammation-mediated osteoporosis, the key elements of inflammatory bowel
      disease-associated bone disease.

PG  - 544-52
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is a complicated condition, including Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis, and indeterminate colitis, that affects 
      the intestine and several extraintestinal sites. There has been much debate
      regarding whether Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are distinct entities or
      if they exist along a continuum of the same disease process. In this article, the
      pathogenic mechanisms and clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease
      are reviewed, as well as treatment options. Because Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis are chronic diseases, they have an important economic effect
      on our healthcare system and the United States as a whole. Some newer and more
      expensive treatment options may provide overall cost savings in select patient
      populations because of decreased use of healthcare resources.

TI  - Overt ischemic colitis after endovascular repair of aortoiliac aneurysms.
PG  - 413-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Controversy exists as to the cause of ischemic colitis complicating
      endovascular aneurysm repair. Occlusion of the hypogastric arteries (HAs) during 
      endovascular repair of aortoiliac aneurysms (AIAs) results in a significant
      incidence of buttock claudication, and has been suggested as a causative factor
      in the development of postprocedural colonic ischemia, in addition to factors
      such as systemic hypotension, embolization of atheromatous debris, and
      interruption of inferior mesenteric artery inflow. To analyze the relationship
      between perioperative HA occlusion and postoperative ischemic colitis, we
      reviewed our experience over 2 years with Food and Drug Administration-approved
      endovascular graft devices for treatment of AIAs. METHODS: Elective repair of
      AIAs with bifurcated endovascular grafts was performed in 233 patients over a
      2-year period. These included 184 AneuRx grafts, 17 Ancure grafts, and 32
      Excluder grafts. During the experience, 44 patients (18.9%) underwent unilateral 
      perioperative HA occlusion (28 right, 16 left) during the course of endovascular 
      AIA repair, and 1 patient (0.4%) underwent bilateral HA occlusion. RESULTS: In 4 
      patients (1.7%) signs and symptoms of ischemic colitis developed 2.0 +/- 1.4 days
      postoperatively. In all patients the diagnosis was confirmed at sigmoidoscopy,
      and initial treatment included bowel rest, hydration, and intravenous antibiotic 
      agents. Three patients with bilateral patent HAs required colonic resection 14.7 
      +/- 9.7 days after the initial diagnosis, and 2 of these 3 patients died in the
      postoperative period. Pathologic findings confirmed the presence of atheroemboli 
      in the colonic vasculature in all 3 patients who underwent colonic resection. The
      fourth patient had undergone multiple manipulations of the left HA in an
      unsuccessful attempt to preserve patency of this vessel during AIA repair. This
      patient recovered completely with nonoperative management. Perioperative
      unilateral HA occlusion was not associated with a significantly higher incidence 
      of postoperative ischemic colitis. CONCLUSION: Perioperative HA occlusion during 
      aortoiliac open or endovascular surgery may contribute to development of the rare
      but potentially lethal complication of ischemic colitis. However, our extensive
      experience suggests that embolization of atheromatous debris to the HA tissue
      beds during endovascular manipulations, rather than proximal HA occlusion, is the
      primary cause of clinically significant ischemic colitis after endovascular
      aneurysm repair.

TI  - Probiotics and the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 286-99
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of
      probiotics beyond simple barrier and antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic
      mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been
      elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial 
      pathogens for a limited number of receptors present on the surface epithelium;
      (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response of gut-associated
      lymphoid and epithelial cells; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of
      pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier function; and (5) induction of T cell
      apoptosis in the mucosal immune compartment. The unraveling of these mechanisms
      of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of
      clinical inflammatory bowel disease. Though level 1 evidence now supports the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of postoperative pouchitis, only
      levels 2 and 3 evidence is currently available in support of the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged during the
      course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar
      therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials are vital to
      investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use,
      single or multi-strain formulation, and the concomitant use of probiotics,
      synbiotics, or antibiotics.

TI  - Resistant starches and health.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - It was initially hypothesized that resistant starches, i.e., starch that enters
      the colon, would have protective effects on chronic colonic diseases, including
      reduction of colon cancer risk and in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent
      studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk,
      increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty
      acids, and dilute fecal bile acids. However the ability of resistant starch to
      reduce luminal concentrations of compounds that are damaging to the colonic
      mucosa, including fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds, still requires
      clear demonstration. As such, the effectiveness of resistant starch in preventing
      or treating colonic diseases remains to be assessed. Nevertheless, there is a
      fraction of what has been termed resistant (RS1) starch, which enters the colon
      and acts as slowly digested or lente carbohydrate in the small intestine. Foods
      in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of
      chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiological effects
      such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher HDL cholesterol levels.
      Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to
      reductions in risk of coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes
      has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer. If carbohydrates have 
      a protective role in colon cancer prevention this may lie partly in the systemic 
      effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different
      carbohydrates, varying in their glycemic index and resistant starch content,
      therefore, remain to be determined. However, as recent positive research findings
      continue to mount, there is reason for optimism over the possible health
      advantages of those resistant starches, which are slowly digested in the small
      intestine.

TI  - Applications and uses of resistant starch.
PG  - 727-32
AB  - For the past 30 years there has been a steady increase in our knowledge of the
      sources, uses and physiological effects of resistant starch. However, it has only
      been in the past decade that the use of ingredients with a high resistant starch 
      content has occurred in foods, initially in Australia but now throughout the
      world. Foods containing these resistant starch-rich ingredients include not only 
      staple foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, but also foods designed for
      those with special physiological or medical needs, such as celiac sensitivity and
      ulcerative colitis, or for individuals who are seeking to manage energy intake
      and control weight. Resistant starch has other benefits when compared with
      traditional sources of dietary fiber in that the preparation and design of foods 
      with additional health benefits have the appearance, taste, and texture
      characteristics that encourage people to consume these "better for you" foods. As
      our knowledge of the range of physiological effects that occur through the
      consumption of resistant starch increases, more applications will be found for
      their inclusion in an expanding range of foods around the world.

TI  - Probiotics in relapsing and chronic diarrhea.
PG  - 515-7
AB  - Diarrhea is common in oncology patients; if it becomes chronic and relapsing, it 
      can be debilitating, hinder planned management, and be difficult to treat. The
      authors describe two patients, one with leukemia who developed recurrent
      Clostridium difficile colitis and another who developed chronic diarrhea after
      bone marrow transplantation. In both patients, administration of antibiotics was 
      suspected as the cause. In one patient, relapsing diarrhea resolved after
      probiotics were given with a 2-day course of metronidazole, and in the other
      patient, chronic diarrhea resolved after probiotics were given; resolution was
      maintained after the probiotics were stopped. Probiotics may offer a way to bring
      about resolution in antibiotic-associated chronic diarrhea.

TI  - [Natural therapy instead of chemistry? Probiotics in gastroenterology].
PG  - 13-7
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that upon ingestion exert health benefits.
      The impact of probiotics on gut flora represents a new and interesting
      therapeutic approach in a number of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
      According to actual publications and guidelines of medical societies, the
      clinical relevance of probiotics can be described as follows: (a) In the case of 
      ulcerative colitis, available data demonstrate benefits of probiotic therapy. (b)
      The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect
      seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics
      is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before 
      probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome
      have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been
      encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and
      therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of Escherichia coli O157 from major food animals
      in Korea.
PG  - 41-9
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7/NM (E. coli O157) is now recognized as an important
      cause of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome worldwide.
      There have been several cases of human E. coli O157 infection in Korea since it
      was first isolated from a patient with hemolytic-uremic syndrome in 1998. Meat,
      other foods, and recreational and drinking water contaminated with animal feces
      are probably the major sources of the E. coli O157 infection. In this study, we
      investigated the prevalence of E. coli O157 in fecal and meat samples of cattle, 
      pigs and chicken in Korea from April 2000 to July 2002. Eighty-six (3.03%) of
      2843 samples were positive for E. coli O157. Most of the E. coli O157 strains
      were isolated from fecal samples of beef and dairy cattle from May to October of 
      each year. Of 86 E. coli O157 isolates, 73 were serotype O157:H7 and 13 were
      serotype O157:NM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of E. coli O157
      virulence markers revealed that all O157:H7/NM isolates were positive for EhlyA, 
      eaeA and rfb(O157), and 77 isolates were positive for stx1 and/or stx2.
      Cytotoxicity analysis revealed that many of the E. coli O157 isolates showed high
      cytotoxicity on Vero cells. Our data suggest that the majority of Korean E. coli 
      O157 isolates from food animals can cause serious diseases in humans.

TI  - Bacteriotherapy using fecal flora: toying with human motions.
PG  - 475-83
AB  - The intestinal flora may play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Components of bowel flora such as Lactobacillus
      acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus have long been used empirically as
      therapeutic agents for GI disorders. More complex combinations of probiotics for 
      therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most
      elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire
      fecal flora. Fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a
      therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. This type of bacteriotherapy
      has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically
      against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort
      for patients with severe Clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent
      diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. Encouraging results have also
      been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation.
      The therapeutic use of fecal bacteriotherapy is reviewed here and possible
      mechanisms of action and potential applications explored. Published reports on
      fecal bacteriotherapy are few in number, and detail the results of small
      uncontrolled open studies and case reports. Nevertheless, given the promising
      clinical responses, formal research into fecal bacteriotherapy is now warranted.

TI  - Microflora in inflammatory bowel diseases: a pediatric perspective.
PG  - S91-3
AB  - Several lines of evidence link inflammatory bowel diseases to modifications of
      intestinal microflora. Epidemiologic and clinical data suggest a triggering role 
      for select agents in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease. Experimental
      evidence indicates that intestinal microorganisms are needed for developing
      intestinal inflammation in IL-10 knockout mice, and this is associated with an
      increased number of adherent clostridia and a decrease of lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria. It may be hypothesized that a host-agent-specific relationship
      leads to an abnormal immune response, which may be genetically driven in select
      inflammatory bowel diseases. However, different from adults, the pattern of
      intestinal microflora undergoes profound changes during the early stage of life, 
      contributing to the development of the immune system. A close relationship exists
      between microbiologic and immunologic imprinting. The microbiologic imprinting in
      neonates may be modified using bacterial probiotics that colonize the intestine, 
      modify the immune response, and decrease the risk for atopy. Probiotics may
      decrease the recurrences of inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary evidence of 
      intestinal antiinflammatory effects has been detected in children with cystic
      fibrosis. Overall these data provide the rationale to investigate the interaction
      between intestinal microflora and the local and general immune response in
      children with, or at risk for, inflammatory bowel diseases. This approach may be 
      a key for understanding the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation and may
      disclose novel strategies to educate better the immune system, particularly
      during its developmental stage.

TI  - Host-bacterial interactions in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 331-41
AB  - Large numbers of different bacterial species are resident in the lumen of the
      distal gastrointestinal tract. The normal intestinal host-microbial interactions 
      are not well understood, but the relationship is generally believed to be either 
      mutually beneficial or beneficial to one without disadvantage to the other.
      Animal model and clinical studies suggest that IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
      may develop in a susceptible individual when the normal host-bacterial
      relationship is dysregulated. In addition to rodent models, this article reviews 
      studies that have investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
      interactions between intestinal mucosal cells and the resident luminal bacteria
      in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. 
      Mechanisms by which the intestinal mucosa is able to avoid pro-inflammatory
      responses to commensal bacteria (and their products) but able to respond
      appropriately to luminal pathogens is currently an area of active investigation. 
      Such studies are beginning to provide important clues regarding possible
      alterations in the mucosa that lead to the development of pro-inflammatory
      responses to resident bacteria in patients with IBD. Approaches to alter the
      intestinal microflora for therapeutic purposes and their potential mechanisms of 
      action are also discussed.

TI  - The effect of probiotic treatment with Clostridium butyricum on enterohemorrhagic
      Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in mice.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 has been considered as an agent
      responsible for outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic
      syndrome. We examined the effect of the probiotic agent Clostridium butyricum
      MIYAIRI strain 588 on EHEC O157:H7 infections in vitro and in vivo using
      gnotobiotic mice. The growth of EHEC O157:H7 and the production of Shiga-like
      toxins in broth cultures were inhibited by co-incubation with C. butyricum. The
      antibacterial effects of butyric and lactic acid were demonstrated in a
      dose-dependent manner. In addition, the inhibitory effect of butyric acid on the 
      viability of EHEC was demonstrated not only at low pH, but also at neutral pH
      adjusted to 7.0. Flowcytometric analysis showed that pre-incubation of Caco-2
      cells with C. butyricum and E. coli K12 inhibited the adhesion of EHEC O157:H7.
      However, the effect of C. butyricum on adhesion of EHEC to Caco-2 cells was more 
      inhibitory than that of E. coli K12. Gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with EHEC
      O157:H7 died within 4-7 days after the infection. On the other hand, all
      gnotobiotic mice prophylactically pre-treated with C. butyricum survived exposure
      to EHEC O157:H7 and of the gnotobiotic mice therapeutically post-treated with C. 
      butyricum, 50% survived. Both counts of EHEC O157:H7 and the amounts of
      shiga-like toxins (Stx1 and Stx2) in fecal contents of gnotobiotic mice
      di-associated with EHEC O157:H7 and C. butyricum were less than those of
      gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with EHEC O157:H7. These results indicated that 
      the probiotic bacterium C. butyricum MIYAIRI strain 588 has preventive and
      therapeutic effects on EHEC O157:H7 infection in gnotobiotic mice.

      occurred in eastern Slovakia. Three children suffered from haemolytic uraemic
      syndrome, two children had bloody diarrhoea, and four adults were asymptomatic
      carriers. Fourteen sorbitol-non-fermenting E. coli O157 isolates harbouring the
      vtx2, eae and ehxA genes were obtained. Verocytotoxin 2 activity was demonstrated
      in all 14 isolates. After epidemiological surveillance, the source of infection
      was identified as unpasteurised cow's milk.

TI  - Evaluation of a cocktail of three bacteriophages for biocontrol of Escherichia
      coli O157:H7.
PG  - 3417-24
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an endemic pathogen causing a variety of human
      diseases including mild diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome,
      and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. This study concerns the exploitation of 
      bacteriophages as biocontrol agents to eliminate the pathogen E. coli O157:H7.
      Two distinct lytic phages (e11/2 and e4/1c) isolated against a human strain of E.
      coli O157:H7, a previously isolated lytic phage (pp01), and a cocktail of all
      three phages were evaluated for their ability to lyse the bacterium in vivo and
      in vitro. Phage e11/2, pp01, and the cocktail of all three virulent phages
      resulted in a 5-log-unit reduction of pathogen numbers in 1 h at 37 degrees C.
      However, bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) emerged following the
      challenge. All tested BIMs had a growth rate which approximated that of the
      parental O157 strain, although many of these BIMs had a smaller, more coccoid
      cellular morphology. The frequency of BIM formation (10(-6) CFU) was similar for 
      e11/2, pp01, and the phage cocktail, while BIMs insensitive to e4/1c occurred at 
      the higher frequency (10(-4) CFU). In addition, BIMs commonly reverted to phage
      sensitivity within 50 generations. In an initial meat trial experiment, the phage
      cocktail completely eliminated E. coli O157:H7 from the beef meat surface in
      seven of nine cases. Given that the frequency of BIM formation is low (10(-6)
      CFU) for two of the phages, allied to the propensity of these mutants to revert
      to phage sensitivity, we expect that BIM formation should not hinder the use of
      these phages as biocontrol agents, particularly since low levels of the pathogen 
      are typically encountered in the environment.

TI  - A novel mouse model of rectal cancer established by orthotopic implantation of
      colon cancer cells.
PG  - 514-9
AB  - A novel intraluminal colon tumor model was established in mice by intrarectal
      instillation of colon cancer cells followed by short-term induction of colitis by
      an irritant agent. Male BALB/c mice were fed a diet containing 3% (w/w) dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days to induce colitis, and colon 26 cells (1-2 x
      10(6) cells/mouse) were infused intrarectally after the mice had been deprived of
      food for the last 18 h of DSS treatment. The tumor incidence (%) and size (mean
      volume +/- SD, mm(3)) at the rectal mucosa were 35% (2 +/- 3), 95% (96 +/- 79),
      95% (141 +/- 137) and 94% (325 +/- 270) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after instillation
      of tumor cells, respectively. Histopathological analyses revealed that a solid
      tumor was formed initially at the rectal mucosa at 1 week after instillation,
      then became invasive into the submucosal and muscular tissues at 3 weeks after
      implantation. Intrarectal instillation of human colon cancer cells, LS174T (1 x
      10(7) cells/mouse), mixed with "Matrigel" (0.5 mg/mouse), an extracellular matrix
      solution, in SCID mice led to formation of rectal tumors at 4 weeks after
      instillation, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells
      expressed human carcinoembryonic antigen, suggesting that the tumor nodule was
      derived from the instilled LS174T cells. Oral or intravenous administration of a 
      camptothecin (CPT) derivative, CPT-11, resulted in a significant reduction in
      tumor incidence and tumor volume in the colon 26-intraluminal implantation
      system. In conclusion, it was suggested that the present intraluminal colon tumor
      model is useful for examination of chemotherapeutic agents and also intraluminal 
      factors (dietary compounds, intestinal microflora, etc.) that might function to
      suppress or enhance the growth of colorectal cancer in situ.

TI  - Clostridium difficile pilot study: effects of probiotic supplementation on the
      incidence of C. difficile diarrhoea.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - Colonic infection with Clostridium difficile, leading to pseudomembranous
      colitis, is a common complication of antibiotic therapy, especially in elderly
      patients. It has been suggested that non-pathogenic probiotic bacteria might
      prevent the development and recurrence of C. difficile infection. This
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study examines the role of probiotic
      administration in the prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in
      elderly patients receiving antibiotic therapy. Consecutive patients (150)
      receiving antibiotic therapy were randomised to receive either a probiotic
      containing both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium or placebo for 20 days. Upon
      admission to hospital, bowel habit was recorded and a faecal sample taken. Trial 
      probiotic or placebo was taken within 72 h of prescription of antibiotics, and a 
      second stool sample was taken in the event of development of diarrhoea during
      hospitalisation or after discharge. Of the randomised patients, 138 completed the
      study, 69 with probiotics in conjunction with antibiotics and 69 with antibiotics
      alone. On the basis of development of diarrhoea, the incidence of samples
      positive for C. difficile-associated toxins was 2.9% in the probiotic group
      compared with 7.25% in the placebo-control group. When samples from all patients 
      were tested (rather than just those developing diarrhoea) 46% of probiotic
      patients were toxin-positive compared with 78% of the placebo group.

TI  - [Lactose malabsorption in patients with inflammatory bowel disease without
      activity: would it be necessary to exclude lactose products in the diet of all
      patients?].
PG  - 212-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients avoid lacteal
      products without evidence of lactose malabsorption, probably because of incorrect
      patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and diet books. AIM: To 
      evaluate the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in patients with IBP. METHOD: In
      18 patients with Crohns disease and 24 with ulcerative colitis and 25 controls
      the prevalence of lactose intolerance, as measured by lactose breath hydrogen
      tests. RESULTS: Observed deficiencies of absorption of the lactose in 7 (16.6%)
      patients with IBP and 5 (20%) subjects control. CONCLUSIONS: Not all the patients
      with IBD are intolerant to the lactose by the suppression of the lacteal produts 
      must not be generalized in the diet of these patients.

TI  - Immune sensitization to yeast antigens in ASCA-positive patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alimentary antigens may play a role in the perpetuation of
      inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). Yeast antigens are widespread components of
      food. A proportion of CD patients develop antibodies against the yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), but little is known about the cellular immune
      reactivity against food antigens in antibody-positive and -negative patients.
      METHODS: Lymphocytes from patients with CD, ulcerative colitis, and healthy
      controls were tested for their proliferative response after stimulation with the 
      yeast antigen mannan and ovalbumin. The cellular phenotypes and activation
      markers were analyzed via FACS. Cytokine concentrations and antibody titers were 
      determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Only lymphocytes of ASCA-positive patients with CD 
      proliferated after stimulation with mannan. These lymphocytes expressed increased
      activation markers (CD25, CD69). Activation of T cells was mediated by
      antigen-presenting cells and was associated with increased tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. The immune reactivity to ovalbumin was
      predominantly found in CD patients. It was weaker compared with mannan,
      independent of ASCA status, and also present in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      disturbed humoral and cellular response to the yeast antigen mannan is
      specifically seen in a subgroup of CD patients. This phenomenon may be due to a
      loss of tolerance toward yeast and is possibly genetically determined.

TI  - Therapeutic manipulation of the enteric microflora in inflammatory bowel
      diseases: antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics.
PG  - 1620-33
AB  - Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis are caused by overly
      aggressive immune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric
      bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinical and experimental
      studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial 
      species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease
      tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease
      luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of
      activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species
      (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined 
      probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill
      evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience
      suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and
      ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis,
      whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative
      colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable 
      promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled
      therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread
      clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of
      treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive agents.

TI  - Environmental risk factors (excluding tobacco and microorganisms): critical
      analysis of old and new hypotheses.
PG  - 497-508
AB  - The increase in incidence in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease during
      the 20th century has led to an abundance of different hypotheses on what sort of 
      exposures are responsible. There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as 
      well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast
      food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of
      this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational 
      studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research
      agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious
      exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better
      hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral
      contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into
      the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - The metabolic activity of fecal microbiota from healthy individuals and patients 
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - The hypothesis was studied that intestinal microbial metabolites play a role in
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. For that purpose, an in vitro
      model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and
      eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over
      time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation.
      Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more 
      short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals.
      Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after
      inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with
      microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all
      microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially
      toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory
      bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from
      these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.

TI  - The probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 for the treatment of collagenous
      colitis: first results of an open-label trial.
PG  - 365-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous colitis is clinically characterized by watery diarrhoea
      and can histologically be diagnosed by a thickening of the subepithelial collagen
      layer and an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. So far, the
      pathogenesis of collagenous colitis and the role of luminal factors remain
      unclear. METHODS: This clinical pilot investigation was conducted with an
      open-label design to monitor the clinical effects of EcN on stool frequency and
      stool consistency in 14 patients (11 female, 3male; age: 58.1 +/- 9.6 years). Due
      to the open-label protocol EcN was administered at different doses (1 - 6
      capsules/day containing 2.5 - 25 x 10 (9) viable bacteria each). Except for two
      patients who discontinued treatment, therapy duration was at least 4 weeks.
      RESULTS: The results indicate a marked clinical response to the oral
      administration of EcN with a reduction of the stool frequency > or = 50 % in 9/14
      (64 %) patients. Stool frequency clearly (p = 0.034) decreased from 7.6 +/-
      4.8/day to 3.7 +/- 5.8/day at the end of therapy (between 4 and 18 weeks).
      Moreover, stool consistency changed in 7/14 patients from watery or slimy to soft
      (6 pts) and normal (1 pt), respectively. CONCLUSION: With respect to the
      preliminary data from this trial, the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) 
      seems to be of therapeutic clinical benefit in collagenous colitis. This may be
      explained with the recently shown antagonistic effect of EcN against Yersinia
      species, since a relevant number of patients suffering from collagenous colitis
      showed positive titres of serum IgG and IgA antibodies against Yersinia species. 
      Further studies on the effects of EcN on mucosal collagen metabolism and
      long-term follow-up are warranted.

TI  - Effects of probiotic on intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1521-5
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of probiotic on intestinal mucosae of patients
      with ulcerative colitis (UC), and to evaluate the role of probiotic in preventing
      the relapse of UC. METHODS: Thirty patients received treatment with
      sulphasalazine (SASP) and glucocorticoid and then were randomly administered
      bifid triple viable capsule (BIFICO) (1.26 g/d), or an identical placebo (starch)
      for 8 wk. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture 2 wk before and after
      the randomized treatments. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically
      and histologically after 2 mo of treatment or in case of relapse of UC. p65 and
      IkappaB expressions were determined by Western blot analysis. DNA-binding
      activity of NF-kappaB in colonic nuclear extracts was detected by electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay (EMSA). mRNA expressions of cytokines were identified by
      semi-quantitative assay, reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Three patients (20%) in the BIFICO group had relapses during
      2-mo follow-up period, compared with 14 (93.3%) in placebo group (P<0.01). The
      concentration of fecal lactobacilli, bifidobacteria was significantly increased
      in BIFICO-treated group only (P<0.01). The expressions of NF-kappaB p65 and DNA
      binding activity of NF-kappaB were significantly attenuated in the treatment
      group than that in control (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory
      cytokines was elevated in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The
      probiotic could impede the activation of NF-kappaB, decrease the expressions of
      TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and elevate the expression of IL-10. These results suggest
      that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in
      preventing flare-ups of chronic UC. It may become a prophylactic drug to decrease
      the relapse of UC.

TI  - Physical activity and reduced risk of incident sporadic colorectal adenomas:
      observational support for mechanisms involving energy balance and inflammation
      modulation.
PG  - 983-92
AB  - To investigate the role of physical activity, energy balance, and inflammation on
      the risk of incident sporadic colorectal adenoma, the authors conducted a
      community- and colonoscopy-based case-control study (n = 177 cases, n = 228
      controls) in Winston-Salem and Charlotte, North Carolina, from 1995 to 1997.
      Participants reported energy intake by a semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire, daily physical activity levels by a standardized questionnaire,
      and anthropometrics by self-assessment. The odds ratios for adenomas comparing
      the highest and lowest quantiles of exposure were 0.63 (95% confidence interval
      (CI): 0.34, 1.17) for physical activity, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.73) for total
      energy intake, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.34) for body mass index, 1.46 (95% CI: 0.73,
      2.92) for waist/hip ratio, and 2.40 (95% CI: 1.24, 4.63) for height. For the
      combined effects of these factors, risk was particularly low for those with
      higher physical activity and low waist/hip ratio (odds ratio = 0.37, 95% CI:
      0.18, 0.75) or shorter stature (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.62). The
      inverse effect of physical activity was apparent only among those not taking
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (odds ratio = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.94).
      These findings add further evidence that physical activity and overall patterns
      indicating positive energy balance increase the risk of adenoma. Furthermore, the
      results suggest indirectly that biologic mechanisms related to inflammation may
      play a role in the beneficial effect of physical activity on the risk of incident
      adenoma.

TI  - Pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of food protein-induced gastrointestinal
      diseases.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although our general understanding of food hypersensitivity
      has improved in recent years, gastrointestinal food protein-induced diseases
      still pose diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. RECENT FINDINGS: Food allergy in 
      children and adults may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical 
      presentations include protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, enteropathy and
      proctocolitis, as well as eosinophilic gastroenteritis and related disorders. For
      many of these conditions, our understanding of the pathophysiology is incomplete.
      Manifestations are mostly non-IgE mediated, and skin prick testing and
      measurement of food-specific IgE antibody levels are of limited diagnostic value.
      Atopy patch testing may be of benefit in identifying food items associated with
      late-onset gastrointestinal reactions. A definitive diagnosis of gastrointestinal
      food allergy, however, still relies on formal food challenges. Depending on the
      clinical presentation, gastrointestinal biopsies may be required. In infancy,
      hypoallergenic formula or maternal elimination diets have been shown to
      effectively control the gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergies. Growth
      parameters and micronutrient levels need to be carefully monitored while on
      elimination diets for prolonged periods. In older children and adults with
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, the response to dietary restriction is
      variable. Corticosteroids may be required to control symptoms in those who failed
      to respond to hypoallergenic diets. In eosinophilic esophagitis, steroids can be 
      administered topically in the form of swallowed aerosols. Leukotriene receptor
      antagonists and other novel therapies may be useful as steroid-sparing agents.
      SUMMARY: Early diagnosis and treatment of food protein-induced gastrointestinal
      diseases may prevent significant nutritional complications. Further research is
      needed to develop diagnostic tools for these mainly cell-mediated disorders.

TI  - Lactobacillus GG in inducing and maintaining remission of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in
      chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
      colitis. Alteration of the intestinal microflora by antibiotic or probiotic
      therapy may induce and maintain remission. The aim of this randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effect of oral Lactobacillus GG (L.
      GG) to induce or maintain medically induced remission. METHODS: Eleven patients
      with moderate to active Crohn's disease were enrolled in this trial to receive
      either L. GG (2 x 10(9) CFU/day) or placebo for six months. All patients were
      started on a tapering steroid regime and received antibiotics for the week before
      the probiotic/placebo medication was initiated. The primary end point was
      sustained remission, defined as freedom from relapse at the 6 months follow-up
      visit. Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI of >100 points. RESULTS: 5/11
      patients finished the study, with 2 patients in each group in sustained
      remission. The median time to relapse was 16 +/- 4 weeks in the L. GG group and
      12 +/- 4.3 weeks in the placebo group (p = 0.5). CONCLUSION: In this study we
      could not demonstrate a benefit of L. GG in inducing or maintaining medically
      induced remission in CD.

TI  - Severe peritonitis due to Balantidium coli acquired in France.
PG  - 393-5
AB  - The case reported here concerns an alcoholic pork-butcher who presented with
      severe colitis with peritonitis, caused by the only ciliate protozoan capable of 
      infecting humans, Balantidium coli. This parasite is common in a variety of
      domestic and wild mammals, mainly pigs; however, its prevalence rate in humans is
      very low--particularly in industrialised, northern countries, including France.
      The infection is most frequently acquired by ingesting food or water contaminated
      by pig faeces, and it may be asymptomatic or may cause acute diarrhoea. Specific 
      antibiotic treatment is efficacious, and it is important to consider the risk of 
      this parasitic disease in susceptible patients presenting with bloody diarrhoea.

TI  - Delay of the first onset of pouchitis by oral intake of the probiotic strain
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
PG  - 876-84
AB  - PURPOSE: Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of
      choice for patients with refractory or fulminant ulcerative colitis. The most
      common long-term complication in these patients is pouchitis. This study was
      designed to investigate the efficacy of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in
      long-term delaying the first onset of pouchitis. METHODS: Between 1989 and 2001, 
      a consecutive series of 127 patients presenting with ulcerative colitis underwent
      an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam.
      Histopathologic investigation of the resected specimens revealed unsuspected
      Crohn's disease in five patients. Postoperative complications resulted in pouch
      excision in five patients. The remaining 117 patients were included in this
      study. All episodes of pouchitis occurring in this group were analyzed. Pouchitis
      was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic
      features. The 39 patients, who underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 
      1996 and 2001, started immediately after the operation with the daily intake of
      L. rhamnosus GG in a fermented product. The 78 patients, in whom an ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis was performed between 1989 and 1996, received no L.
      rhamnosus GG. RESULTS: Except for the duration of follow-up, the patient
      characteristics, indications for proctocolectomy, number of postoperative
      complications, and functional outcome were similar in both groups. First episodes
      of pouchitis were observed less frequently in patients with a daily intake of L. 
      rhamnosus GG (cumulative risk at 3 years: 7 vs. 29 percent; P = 0.011).
      CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of fermented products containing L. rhamnosus GG
      provides significant clinical benefit, without side effects. Based on the results
      of this study, we recommend a daily intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (dose
      1-2 x 10(10) bacteria) to delay the first onset of pouchitis.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo characterization of Helicobacter hepaticus cytolethal
      distending toxin mutants.
PG  - 2521-7
AB  - Helicobacter hepaticus expresses a member of the cytolethal distending toxin
      (CDT) family of bacterial cytotoxins. To investigate the role of CDT in the
      pathogenesis of H. hepaticus, transposon mutagenesis was used to generate a
      series of isogenic mutants in and around the cdtABC gene cluster. An H. hepaticus
      transposon mutant with a disrupted cdtABC coding region no longer produced CDT
      activity. Conversely, a transposon insertion outside of the cluster did not
      affect the CDT activity. An examination of these mutants demonstrated that CDT
      represents the previously described granulating cytotoxin in H. hepaticus.
      Challenge of C57BL/6 interleukin 10(-/-) mice with isogenic H. hepaticus mutants 
      revealed that CDT expression is not required for colonization of the murine gut. 
      However, a CDT-negative H. hepaticus mutant had a significantly diminished
      capacity to induce lesions in this murine model of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Effects of meal frequency and high-fibre rye-bread diet on glucose and lipid
      metabolism and ileal excretion of energy and sterols in ileostomy subjects.
PG  - 1410-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a rye, high-fibre diet (HFD) vs a wheat, 
      low-fibre diet (LFD), meal frequency, nibbling (Nib, seven times a day) or
      ordinary (Ord, three times a day), and their combined effects on blood glucose,
      insulin, lipids, urinary C-peptide and ileal excretion of energy, cholesterol and
      bile acids in humans. DESIGN: LFD period with Nib or Ord meal frequency followed 
      by an HFD diet with Nib or Ord meal frequency in randomized, crossover design.
      SETTING: Outpatients of ileostomy volunteers were called for an investigation in 
      research word. SUBJECTS: A total of 10 subjects (two female subjects, age 34 and 
      51 y; eight males, mean age 54.4 y, range 43-65 y) participated in the
      experiment. All subjects were proctocolectomized for ulcerative colitis (mean
      16.0 y, range 8-29 y before the study). INTERVENTION: In total, 10 ileostomy
      subjects started with LFD for 2 weeks, the first week on either Nib (five
      subjects) or Ord (five subjects) and the second week on the other meal
      frequencies, in a crossover design, followed by a wash-out week, and continued
      with HFD period for 2 weeks in the same meal frequency manner. All foods consumed
      in both Nib or Ord regimens were identical and a high-fibre rye bread was used in
      the HFD period and a low-fibre wheat bread in the LFD period. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Day-profiles of blood glucose, insulin and lipids, blood lipids before 
      and after dietary intervention, and excretion of steroids in the effluents and
      C-peptide in the urine. RESULTS: During the Nib regimen, plasma glucose and
      insulin peaks were lower at the end of the day with HFD compared with LFD.
      Urinary C-peptide excretion was significantly higher in the day-time on LFD
      compared with HFD (LFD-Ord vs HFD-Ord, P < 0.01; LFD-Nib vs HFD-Nib, P < 0.01).
      Plasma free-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids were 
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) after LFD than after HFD with the Nib regimen. A 
      higher excretion of energy (P < 0.05) and chenodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05) were
      observed with HFD compared with LFD regardless of meal frequency. A higher daily 
      excretion of cholic acid, total bile acids, cholesterol, net cholesterol and net 
      sterols (P < 0.05) was observed on HFD compared with LFD with the Nib regimen.
      CONCLUSIONS: An HFD decreased insulin secretion measured as a decreased excretion
      of C-peptide in urine and as decreased plasma insulin peaks at the end of the day
      during a Nib regimen. The smoother glycaemic responses at the end of the day
      during a Nib regimen may be a consequence of a second meal phenomenon, possibly
      related to the nature of dietary fibre complex.

TI  - High incidence of anergy in inflammatory bowel disease patients limits the
      usefulness of PPD screening before infliximab therapy.
PG  - 309-13
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reports of tuberculosis (TB) in patients administered
      infliximab prompted the Food and Drug Administration to recommend that all
      patients being considered for this therapy be evaluated for the risk for latent
      TB infection by means of a tuberculin skin test (TST). The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the utility of a TST as an adequate screen for TB exposure in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive
      patients with IBD (Crohn's disease, 70 patients; ulcerative colitis, 4 patients; 
      indeterminate colitis, 8 patients) seen at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IBD Center
      (Los Angeles, CA) being treated with or considered for infliximab therapy
      underwent a standard intradermal purified protein derivative (PPD) TST before or 
      between infusions of infliximab. One or more control antigens (Candida, tetanus, 
      and/or mumps) were concurrently placed on 69 of these patients. Skin tests were
      read for induration at 48-72 hours after placement, and results were recorded.
      RESULTS: None of 82 patients had a positive PPD TST result. Overall, 71% of
      patients (49 of 69 patients) with controls placed failed to react to any antigen.
      Eighty-three percent of patients (40 of 48 patients) who were administered
      corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive medications, not including infliximab,
      for at least 1 month were anergic compared with 43% of patients (9 of 21
      patients; P < 0.002) who were not administered those medications. CONCLUSIONS:
      Given the high prevalence of anergy, a negative TST result in patients with IBD
      administered infliximab is an unreliable indicator for TB exposure. Evaluation
      for TB risks should include not only a TST, but also a detailed history of
      travel, TB exposures, and such symptoms as chronic cough and weight loss, and a
      chest radiograph should be considered.

TI  - Germinated barley foodstuff prolongs remission in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 643-7
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic which increases luminal butyrate
      production by modulating the microfloral distribution. GBF has been shown to
      reduce both clinical activity and mucosal damage in active ulcerative colitis
      (UC) with mild to moderate activity. However, the efficacy of GBF in patients
      with UC during the remission stage is unknown. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficacy of GBF as a maintenance therapy in patients with UC
      while in remission. Fifty-nine patients with UC in remission according to
      Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index (CAI) score of </=4 were enrolled and
      divided into two groups, control (n=37) and GBF (n=22). Patients in the control
      group were given conventional treatment alone for 12 months, while patients in
      the GBF group received conventional therapy plus 20 g of GBF daily. The response 
      to treatments was assessed by monitoring the CAI and endoscopic score according
      to Matts. Significantly better CAI values were seen in the GBF group at 3, 6, and
      12 months compared with the values in the control group. The cumulative
      recurrence rate in the GBF group with steroid tapering treatment was
      significantly lower compared with the value in the control group. No side effects
      related to GBF were observed. GBF appeared to be effective and safe as a
      maintenance therapy to taper steroid dose and prolong remission in patients with 
      UC.

TI  - Dietary beliefs of people with ulcerative colitis and their effect on relapse and
      nutrient intake.
PG  - 161-70
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ulcerative colitis usually follows a relapsing and remitting
      course. Patients believe that dietary factors are important. We wished to
      determine the nature of and reasons for patients' dietary beliefs and their
      effect on relapse and nutrient intake. METHODS: In a 1-year prospective cohort
      study, patients' nutrient intake and disease activity were measured with a
      validated food frequency questionnaire and disease activity index. Food beliefs, 
      demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. The influence of beliefs 
      on the risk of relapse and nutrient intake were examined using chi-squared and
      Mann-Whitney U-tests. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were studied
      and 52% relapsed. Sixty-eight per cent held dietary beliefs and reported
      modifying their intake accordingly. The most common reported behaviour was the
      avoidance of milk and dairy products. Food beliefs were more common amongst those
      who had received dietary advice. No reported behaviour reduced the risk of
      relapse, but patients who avoided dairy products had a significantly lower intake
      of calcium. Folate intake was below UK recommended levels in 13% of patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis believe that many foods are harmful
      or helpful to their disease activity. Commonly held beliefs do not modify the
      risk of relapse, but do adversely affect nutrient intake.

      differences in formulation. Based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      definitions for bioequivalence, none of these drugs can be classified as
      bioequivalent or therapeutically equivalent. No adequate comparative trials have 
      been conducted with equivalent mesalamine doses to determine if any of the
      current formulations are superior in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. All of 
      these mesalamine formulations are effective, but they differ with regard to where
      the drug is released in the intestinal tract, which may influence the outcome in 
      some patients. Therefore, the selection of a mesalamine agent should be based on 
      the results of the clinical trials, individual patient response, compliance
      issues, and price, until comparative clinical trials are published.

TI  - Population-based case control study of seroprevalence of Mycobacterium
      paratuberculosis in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1129-35
AB  - There is renewed enthusiasm for exploring the possibility that Mycobacterium
      paratuberculosis may be causative in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to determine 
      whether CD subjects are more likely to be M. paratuberculosis seropositive than
      controls. Using our population-based University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Research Registry, we recruited CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) subjects
      between 18 and 50 years of age for a study involving detailed questionnaires and 
      venipuncture. We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health
      (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched
      controls to our inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population. We asked enrolling
      IBD subjects for potential nonaffected sibling controls. We used an enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum antibodies to M. paratuberculosis initially
      developed for cattle but adapted for human use. The rate of positive ELISA
      results, based on previously published interpretation criteria, was significantly
      higher for all study groups. There was no difference in M. paratuberculosis
      seropositivity rate among CD patients (37.8%; n = 283), UC patients (34.7%; n =
      144), healthy controls (33.6%; n = 402), and nonaffected siblings (34.1%; n =
      138). For siblings, there was no correlation between M. paratuberculosis
      serological status and that of the corresponding IBD affected sibling. None of
      the demographic or questionnaire variables studied were predictive of M.
      paratuberculosis status. Subjects with CD and UC were less likely to have
      ingested unpasteurized milk and less likely to have had a non-tap water source as
      a primary water source. In conclusion, in this population-based case control
      study, the M. paratuberculosis seropositivity rate was approximately 35% for all 
      groups and there was no difference in rates between CD patients, UC patients,
      healthy controls, or nonaffected siblings. The much higher rate of seropositivity
      for subjects from Manitoba, Canada, than for those from Denmark or Wisconsin
      cannot be obviously explained. While these data seem to refute any association of
      CD with M. paratuberculosis, the high seroprevalence in Manitobans raises the
      possibility that the high rates of CD in Manitoba could be related to high
      exposure rates for M. paratuberculosis. Hence, the possibility of an association 
      between M. paratuberculosis and CD remains inconclusive.

TI  - [Paracrine actions of the stomach-derived leptin].
PG  - 183-8
AB  - Leptin, a 16 kilodalton protein-encoded by the ob gene, is involved in the
      regulation of food intake, body composition, and energy expenditure through a
      central feedback mechanism. Initially thought to be adipocyte-specific, the ob
      gene, as well as the leptin receptor, has been found in a variety of other
      tissues. Relevant to this review, the leptin gene and its receptor have been
      identified in the stomach, intestine, liver, and pancreas. Recent data also
      suggest that gut leptin may act locally within the gastrointestinal tract to
      influence intestinal functions such as nutrient absorption and may have a
      physiopathological implication. This review emphasises the concept that leptin
      may be a new gastrointestinal hormone.

TI  - A high degree of aneuploidy, loss of p53 gene, and low soluble p53 protein serum 
      levels are detected in ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 304-13
AB  - PURPOSE: The causes for the increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with
      ulcerative colitis have not been fully defined. Colonic tissue of ulcerative
      colitis patients was examined for changes in chromosome-17-centromere copy
      number, loss of the p53 gene, and alterations in serum levels of the 53-kDa
      protein. This study was performed under the assumption that these molecular
      events correlate with ulcerative colitis status and duration. METHODS: Ulcerative
      colitis patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 37) participated in the
      study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. The
      stage of ulcerative colitis patients was stratified according to increasing risk 
      factors for the development of colorectal cancer: left-sided colitis, pancolitis,
      sclerosing cholangitis, and dysplasia-associated lesions or masses. Changes in
      centromere number of chromosome 17 alone or in association with changes in copy
      number of the p53 gene were analyzed in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in 
      situ hybridization. Serum p53 level was determined in blood samples by
      immunoprecipitation followed by separation using high-pressure liquid
      chromatography. RESULTS: Changes in chromosome 17 and p53 copy number and lower
      levels of serum p53 protein in ulcerative colitis patients directly correlated
      with colorectal cancer risk factors. All values significantly differed from
      controls. Significant direct correlations were obtained for ulcerative colitis
      disease duration, levels of p53 in the serum, and extent of aneuploidy.
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis
      patients, high levels of genomic instability, changes in p53 gene copy number,
      and lower levels of p53 in the serum directly correlate with the extent of
      disease duration and increased risk factors for colorectal cancer. Any of the
      measurements described herein can provide an acceptable prognostic tool in the
      assessment of colorectal cancer risk in ulcerative colitis patients.

TI  - Probiotics in gastroenterology: indications and future perspectives.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the
      intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several
      gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been
      disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated
      with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii.
      Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits
      have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea.
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized 
      by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which
      probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and 
      Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce
      relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses
      has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies
      probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for
      probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are
      inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption.
      Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of
      colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this
      disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been
      reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled
      studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use
      can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and
      duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available
      probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be
      elucidated.

TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum 299: beneficial in vitro immunomodulation in cells
      extracted from inflamed human colon.
PG  - 166-73
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study determined the pattern of cytokine
      secretion (interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interferon 
      [IFN]-gamma and IL-10) and their cellular sources in mononuclear cells isolated
      from colonic mucosa from normal and ulcerative colitis (UC) in response to
      probiotic and pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were extracted from
      normal and active UC colonic mucosa and incubated with pure sonicates of
      probiotic, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. Cytokine secretion was measured in
      culture supernatant and intracellular cytokine staining measured using
      fluorescent-activated cytometry. RESULTS: In mononuclear cells isolated from
      normal mucosa, significant increases in mean IL-1beta were observed with
      enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (286.3 +/- 138.7 pg/mL P < 0.05) and E. coli
      (440.5 +/- 194.0 pg/mL P < 0.01) compared with unstimulated control cells (16.7
      +/- 4.8 pg/mL). In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated from active UC mucosa
      produced significant increases in mean IL-1beta in response to stimulation with
      Salmonella dublin (230.5 +/- 38.8 pg/mL P < 0.05), enteropathogenic E. coli
      (231.7 +/- 45.3 pg/mL P < 0.05) and E. coli (465.4 +/- 60.2 pg/mL P < 0.001)
      compared with unstimulated control cells (60.7 +/- 17.1 pg/mL). Escherichia coli 
      also produced significant mean increases of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma compared with
      unstimulated control cells. No significant increases in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or
      IFN-gamma were observed with Lactobacillus plantarum in cells derived from normal
      or inflamed mucosa. Strikingly, incubation of L. plantarum with mononuclear cells
      isolated from active UC mucosa resulted in significant increases of mean IL-10
      (327 +/- 53.5 pg/mL, P < 0.05) compared with unstimulated control cells (29.7 +/-
      13.2 pg/mL). Intracellular cytokine staining confirmed T-cell and macrophage
      IL-10 production after L. plantarum stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus
      plantarum demonstrates beneficial immunomodulatory activity by increasing IL-10
      synthesis and secretion in macrophages and T-cells derived from the inflamed
      colon. This may provide a mechanism through which probiotic bacteria ameliorate
      inappropriate inflammation and induce tolerance.

TI  - Current therapy of ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 37-53
AB  - Ulcerative colitis presents in childhood in 10% of those affected, usually with
      pancolitis. Important features in management include growth, development and
      avoidance of treatment toxicity. This review addresses the current treatment
      options including both the paediatric evidence-based experience and areas where
      paediatric practice is informed by adult studies. Standard treatments include
      sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, purine derivatives
      (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) and surgery. Other immunosuppressant therapies
      and the emerging roles for biological therapies and probiotics are discussed.

TI  - Effects of dietary folate on ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal
      carcinogenesis in the interleukin 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient mice.
PG  - 1262-7
AB  - Folate supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer in 
      subjects with chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). The interleukin (IL) 2- and
      beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient (IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null)) mice
      spontaneously develop colon cancer in the setting of chronic UC. This study
      investigated the effects of dietary folate on the development of UC-associated
      colon cancer in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. Weaning IL-2(null) x
      beta(2)m(null) mice were randomized to receive 0 (deficient; n = 40), 2 (basal
      requirement; control; n = 46), or 8 (supplemented; n = 36) mg folate/kg diet for 
      32 weeks. At necropsy, all macroscopic colonic tumors were identified and
      histologically classified as dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The incidence of
      high-grade lesions (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and invasive
      adenocarcinoma) in the folate-supplemented group was 46% lower than that in the
      control group (35.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.009). The incidence of high-grade
      lesions in the folate-deficient group was also 49% lower than that in the control
      group (33.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.007). The higher mortality rate in the
      folate-deficient group compared with the other two groups (25% versus 6.5% and
      5.6%, P < 0.02) partially accounted for the low incidence of high-grade lesions
      in this group. These data indicate that dietary folate supplementation at 4x the 
      basal dietary requirement significantly suppresses UC-associated colorectal
      carcinogenesis in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. These data also suggest
      that folate deficiency may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis in chronic UC.
      However, the high mortality observed in the folate-deficient group precludes a
      definitive conclusion concerning the effect of folate deficiency on UC-associated
      colorectal carcinogenesis in this model.

TI  - Ileocecal valve-preserving ileostomy after total proctocolectomy--a novel
      technique for ileostomy.
PG  - 7-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although ileoanal anastomosis has become popular for ulcerative
      colitis, in an emergency situation patients must undergo ileostomy. AIM: A novel 
      ileocecal valve-preserving ileostomy procedure was devised to reduce high output 
      liquid loss. METHOD: After total colectomy, the ascending colon was clamped and
      the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve were isolated from the cecum by
      dissection. The ileum was then brought out through a conventional ileostomy
      opening in the abdominal wall. RESULTS: Two patients with ulcerative colitis
      underwent ileostomy in this fashion. The stool became solid within 1 week after
      the start of solid food and their body weight increased by more than 10% 1 year
      after surgery. CONCLUSION: This novel procedure may result in an improvement in
      the quality of life of patients who undergo total proctocolectomy.

TI  - Critical roles for stx2, eae, and tir in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia
      coli-induced diarrhea and intestinal inflammation in infant rabbits.
PG  - 7129-39
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a group of food-borne pathogens that
      can cause diarrhea, colitis, and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The
      importance of several of the proposed EHEC virulence factors lacks experimental
      verification in animal models. The limitations of current animal models led us to
      reexamine the infant rabbit model for the study of EHEC pathogenicity. Here, we
      report that intragastric inoculation of a Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-producing E. coli 
      O157:H7 clinical isolate into infant rabbits led to severe diarrhea and
      intestinal inflammation but no signs of HUS. We constructed a set of isogenic
      derivatives of this isolate with deletions in several putative virulence genes,
      including stx(2), eae, tir, and ehxA, to investigate the contribution of
      individual virulence factors to EHEC pathogenicity. stx(2) increased the severity
      and duration of EHEC-induced diarrhea. Furthermore, although stx(2) had no role
      in EHEC intestinal colonization nor was it required for EHEC-induced
      inflammation, stx(2) altered how the host responded to EHEC infection by
      promoting heterophilic infiltration of the colonic epithelium and lamina propria.
      Intragastric inoculation of purified Stx2 also induced inflammation and diarrhea 
      in this model. Diarrhea and intestinal inflammation were also dependent on EHEC
      colonization, as EHEC derivatives with deletions in eae and tir did not colonize,
      form attaching and effacing lesions, or develop clinical signs of disease. Our
      studies indicate that infant rabbits are a useful model for investigation of the 
      intestinal stage of EHEC pathogenesis and suggest that Shiga toxin may play a
      critical role in causing diarrhea and inflammation in patients infected with
      EHEC.

TI  - Functional outcome and quality of life after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in
      children and adults.
PG  - 983-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past, children with ulcerative colitis were treated with a
      total colectomy, ileostomy and mucous fistula; ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was
      postponed until adulthood. The aim of the present study was to assess the
      functional outcome and quality of life after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and
      determine whether it is justified to perform the operation in children when
      surgery is indicated. METHODS: A retrospective review of 38 medical records was
      carried out, of which there were 19 paediatric patients and 19 adult patients
      (control). A questionnaire survey was conducted. Telephone interviews were
      carried out for the non-respondents. RESULTS: Sixteen patients in the paediatric 
      group (nine boys, mean age: 12 years) and 16 patients in the adult group (10 men,
      mean age: 39 years) were available for analysis. There was no operative
      mortality. The mean bowel frequency per week was 37 and 42. Furthermore, bowel
      frequency during the day was slightly lower in the paediatric group. Children had
      marginally better continence than adults. In the quality of life assessment, the 
      mean utilities in the paediatric group were 0.69 and 0.84 in the preoperative and
      postoperative status, respectively. These were similar to those in the adult
      group (0.62 and 0.82). Both groups achieved significantly favourable
      postoperative responses in terms of ability to perform social activity,
      recreation and enjoying food. CONCLUSIONS: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in
      children is safe, results in good functional outcome and improves the quality of 
      life. Hence, it is justified to perform ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as soon as
      surgery is indicated rather than as a delayed procedure.

TI  - A potent human C5a receptor antagonist protects against disease pathology in a

PG  - 5514-20
AB  - The complement system is implicated in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory
      bowel disease, but the specific role of C5a has never been examined. We have
      compared the efficacy of an orally active human C5a receptor antagonist
      (AcPhe[Orn-Pro-D-cyclohexylalanine-Trp-Arg]), prednisolone, and infliximab
      against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. The drugs
      were administered either 2 days before or 24 h after TNBS instillation, and rats 
      were then examined after 8 days. Drug-free colitis control rats showed severe
      disease pathology with significant mortality (39%). Rats pre or posttreated with 
      the C5a antagonist (10 mg/kg/day peroral, 0.3 mg/kg/day s.c.) had reduced
      mortality and significantly improved macroscopic scores, colon edema, colon
      myeloperoxidase levels, reduced concentrations of TNF-alpha levels in the colon
      and serum, and had greater food intake resulting in greater weight gains than
      colitis-only rats. Rats pretreated with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day s.c.) displayed
      significant improvement in parameters measured, but posttreatment was
      ineffective. Single dose pretreatment with the TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab (3 
      mg/kg i.v.) also had significant improvements in the parameters measured. Rats
      pretreated with a combination of the C5a antagonist and prednisolone showed no
      greater improvements than either drug alone. These findings suggest a central
      role for complement, particularly C5a, in the pathology of TNBS-induced colitis
      in rats, indicating a possible therapeutic role for C5a antagonists in
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Factors associated with ileal mucosal morphology and inflammation in patients
      with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1476-83
AB  - PURPOSE: Pouchitis has been associated with abnormal bacterial flora responding
      to antibiotics. Dietary factors may play a role in modifying the qualitative and 
      quantitative components of the microflora. We evaluated interactions between
      nutritional factors, fecal and mucosal bacterial flora, and mucosal morphology in
      patients with a history of pouchitis compared with patients with optimal outcome 
      at least five years after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.
      METHODS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study: 11 (7 males; mean age,
      49.8 years) with optimal outcome and 21 (11 males; mean age, 47.3 years) with
      pouchitis history. A seven-day food diary was recorded, endoscopy performed, and 
      biopsies taken from the pouch for histology, mucin staining, and bacterial
      culture. Fresh fecal samples were quantitatively cultured, and fecal bile acids
      analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: No differences existed in mean
      nutrient intake, composition of fecal bile acids, or microbial tissue biopsy
      cultures between the groups with and without pouchitis. Those with optimal
      outcome tended to have more benign disease course of ulcerative colitis than
      patients with pouchitis. In those patients, fecal concentrations (log10
      colony-forming unit/g) of anaerobes and aerobes were significantly higher (P =
      0.007). Degree of villous atrophy and colonic metaplasia were both associated
      with fecal anaerobic flora. Low intake of lactose was associated with sulfomucin 
      predominance. A negative correlation existed between fecal aerobes and dietary
      lactose consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A higher total load of fecal anaerobic
      bacterial flora is strongly associated with degree of colonic metaplasia, villous
      atrophy, and inflammation activity after surgery for ulcerative colitis. An
      association existed between dietary lactose, fecal bacteria, and pouch
      morphology. Lactose may have prebiotic properties.

TI  - Study of animal-borne infections in the mucosas of patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and population-based controls.
PG  - 4986-90
AB  - Crohn's disease may be triggered by an infection, and it is plausible to consider
      that such an infection may be animal borne and ingested with our food. There has 
      been considerable interest in the past in determining whether Mycobacterium avium
      subsp. paratuberculosis (M. avium) might be the etiologic agent in Crohn's
      disease since it causes a disease in cattle that is similar to Crohn's disease in
      humans. We aimed to determine if there was an association between Crohn's disease
      and infection with M. avium or other zoonotic agents and compared the findings
      with those for patients with ulcerative colitis, unaffected siblings of Crohn's
      disease patients, or population-based controls without inflammatory bowel
      disease. Patients under age 50 years with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, 
      unaffected siblings of patients, or healthy controls drawn from a
      population-based age- and gender-matched registry were enrolled in a study in
      which subjects submitted to a questionnaire survey and venipuncture. A nested
      cohort underwent colonoscopy plus biopsy. Samples were batched and submitted to
      PCR for the detection of M. avium and other zoonotic agents known to cause
      predominately intestinal disease in cattle, sheep, or swine. Only one patient
      with ulcerative colitis, no patients with Crohn's disease, and none of the
      sibling controls were positive for M. avium, whereas 6 of 19 healthy controls
      were positive for M. avium. Since the control subjects were significantly older
      than the case patients, we studied another 11 patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease who were older than age 50 years, and another single subject with
      ulcerative colitis was positive for M. avium. One other subject older than age 50
      years with ulcerative colitis was positive for circovirus, a swine-borne agent of
      infection. In conclusion, by performing PCR with mucosal samples from patients
      with Crohn's disease and controls, no association between Crohn's disease and
      infection with M. avium or any of the other six zoonotic agents studied could be 
      found.

TI  - Rationale for probiotic and antibiotic treatment strategies in inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 105-28
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis are chronic aggressive disorders which share many similarities
      concerning pathomechanism and clinical course, but have very distinct features.
      Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations,
      such as the terminal ileum and cecum in Crohn's disease and the rectum in
      ulcerative colitis. In recent years, overwhelming evidence accumulated,
      supporting the hypothesis that IBD are characterized by a genetically determined,
      overly aggressive immune response towards ubiquitous luminal antigens, especially
      commensal bacteria and their products. Trials in both human IBD and experimental 
      colitis have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics may influence the
      course of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and antibiotics with narrow
      activity against the anaerobic fraction of the flora can prevent relapse in
      Crohn's disease after surgically induced remission. Since relevant antibiotic
      strategies can be associated with some side effects, the ongoing research
      recently focused on alternative methods to modify the intestinal flora in
      patients with IBD. Clinical observations including few controlled trials, basic
      research, and animal studies have suggested a potential role for probiotic
      bacteria within the treatment regimens for IBD. However, the mode of action of
      these organisms is still largely unclear and in vitro studies are inconclusive.
      This review summarizes recent in vitro and in vivo data regarding the role of the
      intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and 
      possible therapeutic mechanisms of probiotic bacteria relevant to IBD.
      Furthermore, we will review clinical trials examining the efficacy of antibiotic 
      and probiotic treatment strategies in IBD.

PG  - 1017-32
AB  - Biological therapies in inflammatory bowel disease reflect the exponential
      advancement in understanding the human intestinal immune system and particularly 
      the biology of intestinal inflammation during the past decade. The better
      understanding of the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease has evolved from
      desriptive clinical data and genetically engineered animal models. It led to
      great interest in the evaluation of a variety of new therapeutic agents with
      novel actions. This review will discuss the mechanisms of biologicals (antibodies
      against pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell antibodies, anti-inflammtory
      cytokines, adhesion molecule blockers, growth factors, hormones, colony
      stimulating factors, fusion proteins, anti-sense oligonucleotides, trefoil
      peptides, immunostimulatory [ISS] DNA) used in the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease and summarizes the available data on established biologic therapies
      as well as investigational agents and briefly touch on probiotics. Based on the
      data discussed, it seems that biologicals will play an important role in managing
      inflammatory bowel disease in the near future.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis patients by long-term administration of
      germinated barley foodstuff: multi-center open trial.
PG  - 701-4
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF), which mainly consists of dietary fiber and
      glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic for ulcerative colitis (UC). In our
      previous study, we carried out a clinical trial of GBF with mildly to moderately 
      active UC patients and showed that GBF treatment was able to attenuate the
      symptoms of UC in a relatively short-term. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of GBF in the treatment of
      UC in a multi-center open trial. Twenty-one patients with mildly to moderately
      active UC received 20-30 g of GBF for 24 weeks in an open-label protocol while
      baseline treatments (5-amino-salicyrate compounds and/or steroids) were
      continued. The response to the GBF treatment was evaluated using a clinical
      scoring and after 24 weeks of observation, the GBF group showed a significant
      decrease in clinical activity index (especially, the degree of visible blood in
      stools and the presence of nocturnal diarrhea) compared with the control group
      (p<0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. In conclusion, GBF can
      reduce the clinical activity of UC over long-term as well as short-term
      administration. Nutraceutical GBF therapy may have a place in long-term
      management of UC, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy
      in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Comparison of a shiga toxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and two types of
      PCR for detection of shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in human stool
      specimens.
PG  - 4671-5
AB  - Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a major cause of sporadic 
      cases of disease as well as serious outbreaks worldwide. The spectrum of
      illnesses includes mild nonbloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome. STEC produces one or more Stxs, which are subdivided
      into two major classes, Stx1 and Stx2. The ingestion of contaminated food or
      water, person-to-person spread, and contact with animals are the major
      transmission modes. The infective dose of STEC may be less than 100 organisms.
      Effective prevention of infection is dependent on rapid detection of the
      causative bacterial pathogen. In the present study, we examined 295 stool
      specimens for the presence of Stx-producing E. coli by three different methods:
      an Stx enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a conventional PCR assay, and a
      LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay protocol recently developed by our laboratory at
      the Institute of Medical Microbiology at Hannover Medical School. Our intent was 
      to compare these three methods and to examine the utility of the STEC LC-PCR
      protocol in a clinical laboratory. The addition of a control DNA to each sample
      to clearly discriminate inhibited specimens from negative ones enhanced the
      accuracy of the LC-PCR protocol. From our results, it can be concluded that
      LC-PCR is a very useful tool for the rapid and safe detection of STEC in clinical
      samples.

PG  - 821-31
AB  - Probiotics are living micro-organisms that belong to the normal enteric flora and
      exert a beneficial effect on health and well-being. The rationale for the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in pouchitis (the most frequent long-term
      complication following pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis) and postoperative
      recurrence in Crohn's disease is based on convincing evidence suggesting a
      crucial role for the endogenous intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of
      these conditions. Positive results have been obtained with the administration of 
      highly concentrated probiotic preparations in preventing the onset and relapses
      of pouchitis. Further controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of 
      probiotics in the prophylaxis of postoperative recurrences of Crohn's disease and
      in the treatment of mild pouchitis.

TI  - Probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: a critical review.
PG  - 805-20
AB  - Intestinal bacteria play a key role in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics
      attempt to modify disease by favourably altering bacterial composition, immune
      status, and inflammation. Until recently, probiotic therapy was considered 'folk'
      medicine, but there now is emerging interest on the part of the general public
      and scientific communities in the use of probiotics in human disease. This
      practical, evidence-based review examines probiotics as therapy for inflammatory 
      bowel disease in humans. There are very few such published randomized clinical
      trials, but some data exist that possibly show an efficacy of probiotics as
      maintenance therapy in chronic relapsing pouchitis. Obstacles to providing
      probiotic therapy include selection of appropriate strains, poorly regulated
      probiotic quality standardization, processing and human biologic factors which
      impair probiotic viability, difficulty in maintaining new bacterial populations
      in the gut, and local product unavailability. Studies have focused on specific
      inflammatory bowel disease subgroups, limiting general applicability for the
      practitioner. Basic research highlights the importance of bacteria in these
      conditions, and the possibility that probiotics will modify physiological
      parameters. Well-designed, randomized clinical studies are still required to
      define the role of probiotics as therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Role of bacteria in experimental colitis.
PG  - 793-804
AB  - Epidemiology suggests some relationship between the establishment of the gut
      flora and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease. Unrestrained
      activation of the immune system against commensal bacteria appears to be
      responsible for the chronicity of these diseases. In animal models,
      broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the bacterial load and militate against
      intestinal inflammation. Several bacterial species found in of the common
      microflora, including anaerobes, are able to invade the colonic wall when there
      is dysfunction of the colonic mucosal barrier. Most aerobes provoke focal areas
      of acute inflammation, but some anaerobes in the predominant flora induce diffuse
      a fibrogenic transmural response. Current research aims to identify the
      probiotics that might act against these bacteria. Colonization with specific
      probiotic strains, including a bacterium genetically engineered to secrete
      interleukin-10, prevents spontaneous colitis in susceptible mice. Certain
      lactobacilli exhibit anti-inflammatory properties naturally, i.e. without
      previous genetic manipulation. Prebiotics may increase colonization by
      lactobacilli and can prevent mucosal inflammation. Modulation of the gut flora
      with probiotics may prove useful in the prevention and control of inflammatory
      bowel diseases.

PG  - 772-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Authors report clinical, biological and endoscopic data of six
      children aged less 3 months with bloody stools while they were exclusively
      breast-fed. RESULTS: Two girls and four boys aged 1 to 2 months presented with
      isolated but recurrent rectal bleeding. All were explored by fiberoptic
      rectosigmoidoscopy between 1 and 3,2 months. Macroscopic aspects were congestion 
      (6 cases), petechial and ecchymotic (4 cases), with normal mucosal areas (5
      cases). Histopathology showed eosinophilic infiltrates in all 5 children with
      rectal biopsy. Evolution was satisfactory after cow's milk protein exclusion in
      maternal diet for five children and after weaning in 1. All children were weaned 
      with protein hydrolysate. Cow's milk protein were later introduced without
      adverse reactions at 6 to 23 months. CONCLUSION: Food allergy can be considered
      in proctocolitis including exclusive breast-fed children. Evolution after
      maternal diet is, as usual, simple.

AB  - The presence of the persistence factors (anti-lysozyme and anti-complement
      activity) in the vegetative forms of C. difficile was experimentally proved. The 
      effect of different medicines (vitamins B1, B6 and C, prebiotic inulin,
      probiotics Bifidumbacterin and Enterol) on the persistence factors of C.
      difficile and microbial resistance to vancomycin, thienam, lincomycin,
      clindamycin was evaluated. The anti-lysozyme and anti-complement activity of C.
      difficile was found to decrease under the influence of vitamins B1, B6, C,
      inulin, exometabolites of bifidobacteria. Under the impact of the preparations
      used in this study changes in the sensitivity of C. difficile to antibiotics of
      the lincoamide, carbapenem, glycopeptide groups were found to occur. The data
      obtained reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of the
      medicines under study on the intestinal microbiocenosis in patients with
      antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  - Review article: colitis-associated cancer -- time for new strategies.
PG  - 6-9
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a feared and potentially life-threatening
      complication of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis. Currently, the main 
      preventive strategy is a secondary one, i.e. surveillance colonoscopy usually
      after 8 years of disease duration, when the risk for neoplasia begins to
      increase. Despite its widespread acceptance, dysplasia and cancer surveillance is
      unproven in terms of reducing mortality or morbidity and there is a remarkable
      lack of uniformity in the manner in which it is practised. In this review
      article, the pitfalls of dysplasia surveillance are summarized and the need for
      novel chemopreventive and perhaps pharmabiotic approaches for prevention are
      highlighted.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease Part 1: ulcerative colitis--pathophysiology and
      conventional and alternative treatment options.
PG  - 247-83
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC), a subcategory of inflammatory bowel disease, afflicts
      1-2 million people in the United States, and many more worldwide. Although the
      exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains undetermined, the condition appears to 
      be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While
      conventional treatments can be effective in maintaining remission and decreasing 
      the length of active disease periods, the treatments are not without side
      effects, and a significant number of people suffering from UC fail to respond to 
      even the strongest drugs. This article reviews potential unconventional
      treatments - transdermal nicotine, heparin, melatonin, DHEA, probiotics, fiber,
      dietary changes, botanicals, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients - that
      may be considered in conjunction with conventional approaches or as part of a
      comprehensive alternative treatment protocol. In addition this review addresses
      risk factors, pathogenesis, nutrient deficiencies, conventional treatment
      approaches, and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease.

TI  - Ethanol-induced colitis prevents oral tolerance induction in mice.
PG  - 1227-32
AB  - The gut mucosa is a major site of contact with antigens from food and microbiota.
      Usually, these daily contacts with natural antigens do not result in inflammatory
      reactions; instead they result in a state of systemic hyporesponsiveness named
      oral tolerance. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with the
      breakdown of the immunoregulatory mechanisms that maintain oral tolerance.
      Several animal models of IBD/colitis are available. In mice, these include
      targeted disruptions of the genes encoding cytokines, T cell subsets or signaling
      proteins. Colitis can also be induced by intrarectal administration of chemical
      substances such as 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in 50% ethanol. We report 
      here a novel model of colitis induced by intrarectal administration of 50%
      ethanol alone. Ethanol-treated mice develop an inflammatory reaction in the colon
      characterized by an intense inflammatory infiltrate in the mucosa and submucosa
      of the large intestine. They also present up-regulation of both interferon gamma 
      (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) production by cecal lymph node and splenic
      cells. These results suggest a mixed type of inflammation as the substrate of the
      colitis. Interestingly, cells from mesenteric lymph nodes of ethanol-treated mice
      present an increase in IFN-gamma production and a decrease in IL-4 production
      indicating that the cytokine balance is altered throughout the gut mucosa.
      Moreover, induction of oral tolerance to ovalbumin is abolished in these animals,
      strongly suggesting that ethanol-induced colitis interferes with immunoregulatory
      mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa. This novel model of colitis resembles human 
      IBD. It is easy to reproduce and may help us to understand the mechanisms
      involved in IBD pathogenesis.

TI  - A consistent pattern of minor immunodeficiency and subtle enteropathy in children
      with multiple food allergy.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated allergies are readily
      identifiable, non-IgE-mediated allergies present more diagnostic difficulty. We
      performed a formal retrospective analysis to determine whether there is a
      recognizable clinical pattern in children. METHODS: We studied 121 children (mean
      age, 17.3 months) with multiple food allergies who were recruited on the basis of
      adequate immunological assessment by using case notes and parental questionnaire.
      RESULTS: Group 1 (n=44) had rapid reactions to dietary antigens, of whom 41 also 
      showed delayed reactions. Group 2 (n=77) had delayed reactions only. Mean IgE was
      increased in group 1 but both groups otherwise shared a pattern of increased
      IgG1, decreased IgG2/4, and low-normal IgA. Lymphocyte subsets were skewed, with 
      an increased percentage of CD4 and CD19 and decreased CD8 and natural killer
      cells. Gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, subtle enteropathy, and constipation
      were frequent in both groups. Of 55 exclusively breast-fed infants, 44 sensitized
      before weaning. Twenty-one of the mothers suffered from autoimmunity.
      CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a recognizable pattern of immune deviation and
      minor enteropathy in children with multiple food allergy, irrespective of the
      speed of reactions. Disturbed gut motility is particularly common, as is a
      maternal history of autoimmunity.

TI  - Probiotic lactobacilli: a new perspective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1973-80
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      results from an interaction between susceptibility genes, the host's bacterial
      environment, gut barrier defects, and immunological factors. New management
      approaches have been evolved from advances in our understanding of the
      pathobiology of this common gut disorder In particular, the therapeutic
      manipulation of the bacterial microenvironment in the gut seems to offer an
      innovative tool for the treatment of those patients. Since the gut is a highly
      sensitizing organ that contributes to the systemic immune response, potent
      treatments need to be developed to reduce gut inflammation in this disorder.
      Recent studies have demonstrated that probiotic lactobacilli, and also
      immunostimulatory DNA sequences from those same bacteria have an important
      anti-inflammatory potential in this context. Future research should better define
      among patients with inflammatory bowel disease the various clinical phenotypes
      with the greatest potential of response to probiotic treatment. Identification of
      the genes leading to the disease and a rather better understanding of the
      underlying immunoregulatory abnormalities will be crucial steps to define the
      different profiles of interaction between endogenous digestive bacterial flora
      and the immune system in each individual patient. Such advances will probably
      lead to targeting of effective treatments, including bacteriotherapy with
      probiotic lactobacilli, to subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

      bleeding].
PG  - 260-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate the importance of eosinophilis infiltrated in
      the rectal mucous which jointly with the clinical features can serve to establish
      the diagnostic of allergic colitis. AIM: To describe prospectively, the clinical 
      features and morphological abnormalities of the rectal mucosa in patients with
      rectal bleeding and clinical diagnosis of cow's milk allergy. METHODS: Clinical
      features of 20 infants under 6 months of age were described. Morphological
      findings in rectal mucosa were compared with control group, with suspicion of
      congenital megacolon. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 97 +/- 47 days,
      rectal bleeding started before 120 days in 85% of them; 40% were breastfed, 60%
      cow's milk formula or both. The most striking morphological feature, in 18
      patients, was eosinophilic infiltration in the rectal mucosa. There was a
      significant statistical difference when these values were compared with control
      group. CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of eosinophils in the rectal mucosa
      represent the most important characteristic of allergic colitis, in patients
      under 6 months, with rectal bleeding, when breastfed, cow's milk formula or both.

TI  - CBP 1011: Colirest, Hematrol.
PG  - 241-2
AB  - InKine Pharmaceutical Co. is developing an oral compound, CBP 1011, for the
      treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [Hematrol] and for the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      (Colirest). This profile has been selected from R&D Insight, a pharmaceutical
      intelligence database produced by Adis International Ltd. CBP 1011 or
      medroxyprogesterone, is a progesterone agonist and inhibits pro-inflammatory
      mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). CBP 1011 was
      originally developed by CorBec Pharmaceuticals, which in 1997 was aquired by
      Panax and then intergrated into InKine Pharmaceuticals. According to a company
      spokesperson, InKline is pursuing outlicensing opportunities for Hematrol since
      the company's current commercial focus is on gastrointestinal products. In June
      2000, InKine announced the completion of a study comparing the bioavailability of
      a commercially viable tablet formulation of CBP 1011 to the original capsule
      formulation that is currently being used in the company's phase III studies in
      patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Preliminary results from this 
      study indicate that the bioavailability of the tablet formulation does not differ
      significantly from that of the capsule formulation. The trial enrolled ITP
      patients (i) who are HIV positive, (ii) who are chronic ITP sufferers despite
      having had a splenectomy, (iii) who are older, or (iv) who have less severe
      thrombocytopenia. In preclinical trials, CBP 1011 was shown to decrease
      lymphocyte infiltration into the bowel compared with the control. Studies also
      show that it possibly offers safety benefits over steroid therapies. In June
      2001, InKine commenced enrolment for a pivotal phase III trial in the treatment
      of Crohn's disease. This randomised, double-blind trial will enrol approximately 
      250 patients and will compare two doses of CBP 1011 (400 and 1000mg) with
      placebo. In April 2003, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted InKine
      Pharmaceutical a 'Notice of Allowance' for the 'Method of Treating Inflammatory
      Conditions with Progesterone or Progesterone Analogs'. This patent for
      medroxyprogesterone (Colirest) provides InKine patent protection for the use of
      Colirest in treating patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
      proctitis, microscopic colitis, allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, food
      allergies, drug-induced oesophagitis, coeliac disease, recurrent polyps and
      haemorrhoids. The patent protection also covers Colirest in a variety of delivery
      forms such as tablet, enema, suppository, foam, gel, ointment and suspension.

TI  - A pilot trial of Saccharomyces boulardii in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 697-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Probiotics can be useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease. In a previous report, the non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii
      was found to be beneficial in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease. The
      aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of S. boulardii in ulcerative
      colitis patients. METHODS: A group of 25 patients with a mild to moderate
      clinical flare-up of ulcerative colitis received additional treatment with S.
      boulardii 250 mg three times a day for 4 weeks during maintenance treatment with 
      mesalazine. These patients were unsuitable for steroid therapy. Before and after 
      treatment, Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index was calculated. The probiotic
      treatment was considered a therapeutic success only when the final score was
      lower than 6. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients who completed the study, 17 attained
      clinical remission; this was confirmed endoscopically. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      preliminary results suggest that S. boulardii can be effective in the treatment
      of ulcerative colitis. Controlled studies with this probiotic agent are
      warranted.

TI  - Crohn's disease: a defensin deficiency syndrome?
PG  - 627-34
AB  - This comprehensive review promotes the novel concept that a defensin deficiency, 
      i.e. lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics, may play a pivotal role in the
      aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Such an impaired function of this chemical 
      barrier is consistent with the epidemiological relationship of good domestic
      hygiene with the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. The disregulated
      adaptive immune system, formerly believed to be the major cause in the
      development of Crohn's disease, may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal
      defence since the immune response is mostly directed against lumenal bacteria.
      Recent work has identified five different defensins expressed in colonic mucosa. 
      In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is characterised by an
      impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. This deficient induction may 
      be due to changes in the intracellular transcription by NFkappaB and the
      intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2, mutated in Crohn's disease. These
      findings are consistent with the mucosal attachment of lumenal bacteria in
      inflammatory bowel diseases and the frequent occurrence of other infectious
      agents. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also
      consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain
      inflammatory bowel disease states.

TI  - Is nutrition an aetiological factor for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 607-13
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process, the aetiology
      of which is complex and probably multi-factorial. Nutrition has been proposed to 
      be an important aetiological factor for IBD. The present review critically
      examines the relationship between components of the diet (such as sugar, fat,
      fibre, fruit and vegetables, and protein) and IBD, including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. In addition, it investigates the possible role of infant
      feeding practices in the development of IBD.

TI  - IgE and non-IgE food allergy.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) is characterized by an abnormal immunologic
      reactivity to food proteins. The gastro-intestinal tract serves not only a
      nutritive function but also is a major immunologic organ. Although previously
      thought to be triggered primarily by an IgE-mediated mechanism of injury,
      considerable evidence now suggests that non-IgE mechanisms may also be involved
      in the pathogenesis of FA. OBJECTIVE: To review the immunologic disturbances that
      occur in FA and to correlate these with the clinical manifestations expressed in 
      affected target organs based upon a classification of IgE and non-IgE mechanisms.
      METHODS: Data collected from a computerized MEDLINE search were used for the
      analysis of the following topics: immediate GI hypersensitivity, oral allergy
      syndrome, acute urticaria and angioedema, acute bronchospasm, celiac disease,
      cow's milk enteropathy, dietary protein enterocolitis, breast milk colitis,
      proctolitis, proctitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, Heiner syndrome, eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit-hyperactivity
      disorder and behavioral disorders, as well as systems affected by mucosal
      associated lymphoid tissue-mediated injury of associated lymphoid tissues and the
      immunologic deviation to Th1 or Th2 mechanisms of FA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this review allow the construction of a central, unifying hypothesis for a new
      classification of FA as follows: the clinical manifestations of FA, expressed in 
      affected target organs, may be the result of immunologic injury mediated by
      interaction of food antigens with contiguous elements of mucosal associated
      lymphoid tissue. These appear to be modulated by relative imbalances of the
      Th1/Th2 paradigm, which may be the ultimate determinant governing the expression 
      of FA as IgE-mediated, non--IgE-mediated, or mixed forms of IgE/non-IgE
      mechanisms of FA.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis using fecal bacteriotherapy.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the etiology of idiopathic ulcerative colitis (UC) remains
      poorly understood, the intestinal flora is suspected to play an important role.
      Specific, consistent abnormalities in flora composition peculiar to UC have not
      yet been described, however Clostridium difficile colitis has been cured by the
      infusion of human fecal flora into the colon. This approach may also be
      applicable to the treatment of UC on the basis of restoration of flora
      imbalances. GOAL: To observe the clinical, colonoscopic and histologic effects of
      human probiotic infusions (HPI) in 6 selected patients with UC. CASE REPORTS: Six
      patients (3 men and 3 women aged 25-53 years) with UC for less than 5 years were 
      treated with HPI. All patients had suffered severe, recurrent symptoms and UC had
      been confirmed on colonoscopy and histology. Fecal flora donors were healthy
      adults who were extensively screened for parasites and bacterial pathogens.
      Patients were prepared with antibiotics and oral polyethylene glycol lavage.
      Fecal suspensions were administered as retention enemas within 10 minutes of
      preparation and the process repeated daily for 5 days. By 1 week post-HPI some
      symptoms of UC had improved. Complete reversal of symptoms was achieved in all
      patients by 4 months post-HPI, by which time all other UC medications had been
      ceased. At 1 to 13 years post-HPI and without any UC medication, there was no
      clinical, colonoscopic, or histologic evidence of UC in any patient. CONCLUSIONS:
      Colonic infusion of donor human intestinal flora can reverse UC in selected
      patients. These anecdotal results support the concept of abnormal bowel flora or 
      even a specific, albeit unidentified, bacterial pathogen causing UC.

TI  - Biological containment of genetically modified Lactococcus lactis for intestinal 
      delivery of human interleukin 10.
PG  - 785-9
AB  - Genetically modified Lactococcus lactis secreting interleukin 10 provides a
      therapeutic approach for inflammatory bowel disease. However, the release of such
      genetically modified organisms through clinical use raises safety concerns. In an
      effort to address this problem, we replaced the thymidylate synthase gene thyA of
      L. lactis with a synthetic human IL10 gene. This thyA- hIL10+ L. lactis strain
      produced human IL-10 (hIL-10), and when deprived of thymidine or thymine, its
      viability dropped by several orders of magnitude, essentially preventing its
      accumulation in the environment. The biological containment system and the
      bacterium's capacity to secrete hIL-10 were validated in vivo in pigs. Our
      approach is a promising one for transgene containment because, in the unlikely
      event that the engineered L. lactis strain acquired an intact thyA gene from a
      donor such as L. lactis subsp. cremoris, the transgene would be eliminated from
      the genome.

TI  - Immunomodulatory consequences of oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      strain GG in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the
      treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. Although
      the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are
      largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. The objective of this
      study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus subspecies GG (Lb. GG) on the cellular immune response to intestinal
      microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood cells (PB) were
      stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and
      isolated Bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (Bfg) or Escherichia coli (Esch.
      coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma,
      TNF-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. CD4+ T-lymphocyte activation
      was determined by measurement of intracellular ATP following lysis of the cells. 
      The activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes towards isolated and
      heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic
      treatment. Additionally, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and in part IFN-gamma cytokine secretion
      by PB cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single
      members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the IL-10 and in part
      IL-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. In contrast, the
      activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole
      'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both 
      responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. This study 
      documents a direct effect by Lb. GG on the cellular immune system of healthy
      volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation
      due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.

TI  - Probiotics: a perspective on problems and pitfalls.
PG  - 34-6
AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut flora with probiotics promises to be a useful
      strategy for several disorders, including infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic
      conditions. However, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the normal flora
      and of the optimal use of probiotic products. At present, there is no reliable in
      vitro predictor of in vivo efficacy of putative probiotics. Indeed, probiotic
      performance should be defined in the context of the disease indication for which 
      it is intended. This will require rigorous prospective clinical trials. In
      addition, guidelines for routine clinical use of probiotics are confounded by
      insufficient data on optimum strain selection, dose, delivery vehicle and
      monitoring. Before the promise can be fulfilled, problems and potential pitfalls 
      with probiotic therapy need resolution.

TI  - Increasing fecal butyrate in ulcerative colitis patients by diet: controlled
      pilot study.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - Topical butyrate has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Butyrate is derived from colonic fermentation of dietary fiber, and
      our aim was to study whether UC patients could safely increase the fecal butyrate
      level by dietary means. We enrolled 22 patients with quiescent UC (mean age, 44
      years; 45% women; median time from last relapse, 1 year) in a controlled pilot
      trial lasting 3 months. The patients were instructed to add 60 g oat bran
      (corresponding to 20 g dietary fiber) to the daily diet, mainly as bread slices. 
      Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyrate, disease activity, and
      gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded every 4 weeks. During the oat bran
      intervention the fecal butyrate concentration increased by 36% at 4 weeks (from
      11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 15 +/- 2 micromol/g feces) (p < 0.01). The mean
      butyrate concentration over the entire test period was 14 +/- 1 micromol/g feces 
      (p < 0.05). Remaining fecal SCFA levels were unchanged. No patient showed signs
      of colitis relapse. Unlike controls, the patients showed no increase in
      gastrointestinal complaints during the trial. Yet patients reporting abdominal
      pain and reflux complaints at entry showed significant improvement at 12 weeks
      that returned to baseline 3 months later. This pilot study shows that patients
      with quiescent UC can safely take a diet rich in oat bran specifically to
      increase the fecal butyrate level. This may have clinical implications and
      warrants studies of the long-term benefits of using oat bran in the maintenance
      therapy in UC.

TI  - Enhanced histamine metabolism: a comparative analysis of collagenous colitis and 
      food allergy with respect to the role of diet and NSAID use.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: To compare clinical data and histamine metabolism of
      patients with collagenous colitis with those of food allergy. METHODS: In 17
      patients with collagenous colitis, clinical findings (diarrhoea, abdominal pain) 
      were recorded. Plasma (for histamine) and 12-h-urine (for histamine and
      n-methylhistamine, all measured by RIA) were collected during two days with an
      unrestricted diet followed by two days with an hypoallergenic. The clinical data 
      and measured values were compared with those from patients with confirmed food
      allergy (n = 21) and controls (n = 41). RESULTS: Patients with collagenous
      colitis were found to present with significantly more liquid stools than patients
      with food allergy (p < 0.001) during both types of diet, but they did not
      experience more abdominal pain. N-methylhistamine in 12-h-urine was significantly
      increased during both types of diet in patients with collagenous colitis and food
      allergy when compared with controls (p < 0.001 for all). Patients with food
      allergy--but not those with collagenous colitis--showed a significant decrease of
      severity of pain (p < 0.05) when the diet was changed to the elimination
      protocol. CONCLUSION: Histamine is extensively produced and metabolised in
      patients with collagenous colitis. In contrast to food allergy, the allergenic
      potency of the administered food seems not to influence histamine production in
      collagenous colitis. However, histamine metabolism corresponds with the clinical 
      activity in both patients with food allergy and collagenous colitis.

TI  - Intestinal flora and mucosal immune responses.
PG  - 77-86
AB  - The normal intestinal flora and the mucosal immune system exist in close spatial 
      proximity. A normal structure and function of both very complex systems is
      required for health and develops in a constant and interactive process. An
      abnormal host response to the normal intestinal flora leads to chronic intestinal
      inflammation. Probiotic bacteria may modulate the intestinal flora and the
      mucosal immune response and are an effective therapy for remission maintenance of
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis.

TI  - Importance of processing for physico-chemical and physiological properties of
      dietary fibre.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - There is considerable loss of DM during wet heat treatment of vegetables, leading
      to an increase in dietary fibre. Correction for the loss of DM indicates that the
      effects on total dietary fibre are minor. There is, however, depolymerization of 
      the dietary fibre polysaccharides. The degradation is related to the severity of 
      the heat treatment. Souring, freezing and mild microwave treatment have no
      effects. The viscosity is in general related to the extent of polymerisation.
      Microwave treatment has different effects on various cultivars of green beans,
      and the addition of salt (NaCl and CaCl2) to the boiling water changes the
      physico-chemical properties of soluble fibre in carrots, depending on the cation.
      The higher viscosity of the soluble fibre in raw carrots may partly explain the
      lower glucose and hormonal responses observed in healthy subjects when compared
      with blanched and microwave-cooked carrots. In studies on rats the amount of
      butyric acid in the distal colon has been shown to be higher with dietary
      components containing high amounts of resistant starch. Further, the
      fermentability is lower and the butyric acid concentration higher with composite 
      foods than with the corresponding purified fibre fractions. In human studies the 
      faecal concentration of butyric acid has been shown to increase in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis when [beta-glucan-enriched oat bran (20 g fibre) is added to
      the diet for 12 weeks. Also, an improvement of symptoms was reported.

TI  - Assessment of mucosal inflammation and circulation in response to probiotics in
      patients operated with ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition, and a disturbed
      microbiological flora and mucosal blood flow in the pouch have been suggested as 
      possible causes. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has been used successfully to
      measure gastric and colonic mucosal perfusion in humans. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the effect of intervention with probiotics on ileal pouch
      inflammation and perfusion in the pouch, assessed by endoscopy, histology, fecal 
      calprotectin and LDF. METHODS: A fermented milk product (Cultura; 500 ml)
      containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteria (Bb-12) was given daily
      for 4 weeks to 10 patients operated with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Mucosal perfusion was measured with LDF and the degree
      of inflammation was examined at predefined levels of the distal bowel by
      endoscopy and histology. Stool samples were cultured for lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria and calprotectin were measured before and after intervention.
      RESULTS: The LDF measurements were reproducible in the pelvic pouch at each of
      the predefined levels, but did not change after intervention. The mucosal
      perfusion was reduced in the distal compared to the proximal part of the pouch.
      Calprotectin levels did not change significantly after intervention. The median
      endoscopic score for inflammation was significantly reduced by 50% after
      intervention, whereas the histological score did not change significantly.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that probiotics primarily act superficially, with
      change of gross appearance of the mucosa at endoscopy, but without significant
      effect on histological picture, mucosal perfusion or faecal calprotectin, during 
      a relatively short period of 4 weeks.

TI  - Prophylaxis of pouchitis onset with probiotic therapy: a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1202-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have recently documented the efficacy of a highly
      concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3) in the prevention of flare-up in
      patients with chronic pouchitis. The aim of this study was to compare probiotic
      therapy with VSL#3 versus placebo in the ability to prevent the onset of acute
      pouchitis during the first year after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. METHODS:
      Forty consecutive patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for
      ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive either VSL#3 (1 packet containing
      900 billion bacteria/day) (n = 20) or an identical placebo (n = 20) immediately
      after ileostomy closure for 1 year. The patients were assessed clinically,
      endoscopically, and histologically after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
      Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      Questionnaire. RESULTS: Two of the 20 patients (10%) treated with VSL#3 had an
      episode of acute pouchitis compared with 8 of the 20 patients (40%) treated with 
      placebo (log-rank test, z = 2.273; P < 0.05). Treatment with VSL#3 determined a
      significant improvement in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score,
      whereas this was not the case with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VSL#3 is 
      effective in the prevention of the onset of acute pouchitis and improves quality 
      of life of patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.

TI  - Forage feeding to reduce preharvest Escherichia coli populations in cattle, a
      review.
PG  - 852-60
AB  - Although Escherichia coli are commensal organisms that reside within the host
      gut, some pathogenic strains of E. coli can cause hemorrhagic colitis in humans. 
      The most notable enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain is O157:H7. Cattle are
      asymptomatic natural reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7, and it has been reported that
      as many as 30% of all cattle are carriers of this pathogen, and in some
      circumstances this can be as high as 80%. Feedlot and high-producing dairy cattle
      are fed large grain rations in order to increase feed efficiency. When cattle are
      fed large grain rations, some starch escapes ruminal microbial degradation and
      passes to the hind-gut where it is fermented. EHEC are capable of fermenting
      sugars released from starch breakdown in the colon, and populations of E. coli
      have been shown to be higher in grain fed cattle, and this has been correlated
      with E. coli O157:H7 shedding in barley fed cattle. When cattle were abruptly
      switched from a high grain (corn) diet to a forage diet, generic E. coli
      populations declined 1000-fold within 5 d, and the ability of the fecal generic
      E. coli population to survive an acid shock similar to the human gastric stomach 
      decreased. Other researchers have shown that a switch from grain to hay caused a 
      smaller decrease in E. coli populations, but did not observe the same effect on
      gastric shock survivability. In a study that used cattle naturally infected with 
      E. coli O157:H7, fewer cattle shed E. coli O157:H7 when switched from a feedlot
      ration to a forage-based diet compared with cattle continuously fed a feedlot
      ration. Results indicate that switching cattle from grain to forage could
      potentially reduce EHEC populations in cattle prior to slaughter; however the
      economic impact of this needs to be examined.

TI  - Intestinal bacteria and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 9-20
AB  - Convincing evidence from both animal models and the study of patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates the intestinal microflora in the initiation
      and maintenance of the inflammatory processes in this condition. Despite this, no
      specific pathogen has been identified as causal and the disease is widely
      believed to occur as the result of a genetically determined, but abnormal immune 
      response to commensal bacteria. When compared with healthy people, UC patients
      have increased levels of mucosal IgG directed against the normal microflora.
      Studies of mucosal bacterial populations in UC indicate that there may be
      increased numbers of organisms, but reduced counts of "protective" bacteria such 
      as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. In animal models of colitis, antibiotics,
      particularly metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and the combination of
      vancomycin/impinemem protect against UC, especially if given before the onset of 
      inflammation. These antibiotics target anaerobes and some Gram-positive organisms
      such as enterococci. However, antibiotic use in more than a dozen randomised
      control trials has been very disappointing, probably because we do not know which
      species to target, when to give the antibiotics, for how long and in what
      combinations. Surprisingly, therefore, there is a consistent benefit in the small
      number of studies reported of probiotics to manage UC and pouchitis. There is
      scope for more work in this area focussing on the mucosal microflora, its
      interactions with the gut immune system, its metabolic properties and the
      potential ways of modifying it.

TI  - Nondigestible oligosaccharides enhance bacterial colonization resistance against 
      Clostridium difficile in vitro.
PG  - 1920-7
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the principal etiologic agent of pseudomembranous
      colitis and is a major cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea. A
      limited degree of success in controlling C. difficile infection has been achieved
      by using probiotics; however, prebiotics can also be used to change bacterial
      community structure and metabolism in the large gut, although the effects of
      these carbohydrates on suppression of clostridial pathogens have not been well
      characterized. The aims of this study were to investigate the bifidogenicity of
      three nondigestible oligosaccharide (NDO) preparations in normal and
      antibiotic-treated fecal microbiotas in vitro and their abilities to increase
      barrier resistance against colonization by C. difficile by using cultural and
      molecular techniques. Fecal cultures from three healthy volunteers were
      challenged with a toxigenic strain of C. difficile, and molecular probes were
      used to monitor growth of the pathogen, together with growth of bifidobacterial
      and bacteroides populations, over a time course. Evidence of colonization
      resistance was assessed by determining viable bacterial counts, short-chain fatty
      acid formation, and cytotoxic activity. Chemostat studies were then performed to 
      determine whether there was a direct correlation between bifidobacteria and C.
      difficile suppression. NDO were shown to stimulate bifidobacterial growth, and
      there were concomitant reductions in C. difficile populations. However, in the
      presence of clindamycin, activity against bifidobacteria was augmented in the
      presence of NDO, resulting in a further loss of colonization resistance. In the
      absence of clindamycin, NDO enhanced colonization resistance against C.
      difficile, although this could not be attributed to bifidobacterium-induced
      inhibitory phenomena.

TI  - [Collagenous colitis: macroscopically invisible, but with various treatment
      options].
PG  - 353-6
AB  - Two female patients, aged 54 and 67 years, respectively, had suffered from watery
      diarrhoea for several weeks or months without cramps or blood in the stools. The 
      findings upon physical examination, blood and faecal examination and endoscopy
      were normal, and subsequent histological examination of intestinal biopsies
      revealed collagenous colitis. After treatment with a high-fibre diet,
      sulphasalazine and either prednisone or budesonide, the symptoms subsided.
      Collagenous colitis is a chronic watery diarrhoea disorder with unknown aetiology
      and pathogenesis. It is characterised by macroscopically normal mucosa, while
      histopathologically an abnormal thickening of the subepithelial collagenous layer
      and an increase in the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes is found. There are
      various treatment options such as dietary fibre, mesalazine or
      bismuthsubsalicylate. Recently budesonide has been found to have a favourable
      effect both clinically and histologically. Complications of the disease are rare.

TI  - Curcumin attenuates DNB-induced murine colitis.
PG  - G235-43
AB  - Numerous therapies used for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) target the
      transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is involved in the production of cytokines 
      and chemokines integral for inflammation. Here we show that curcumin, a component
      of the spice turmeric, is able to attenuate colitis in the dinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (DNB)-induced murine model of colitis. When given before the
      induction of colitis it reduced macroscopic damage scores and NF-kappaB
      activation. This was accompanied by a reduction in myeloperoxidase activity, and 
      using semiquantitative RT-PCR, an attenuation of the DNB-induced message for
      IL-1beta was detected. Western blotting analysis revealed that there was a
      reproducible DNB-induced activation of p38 MAPK detected in intestinal lysates by
      using a phosphospecific antibody. This signal was significantly attenuated by
      curcumin. Furthermore, we show that the immunohistochemical signal is
      dramatically attenuated at the level of the mucosa by curcumin. We conclude that 
      the widely used food additive curcumin is able to attenuate experimental colitis 
      through a mechanism correlated with the inhibition of the activation of NF-kappaB
      and effects a reduction in the activity of p38 MAPK. We propose that this agent
      may have therapeutic implications for human IBD.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of pouchitis.
PG  - 75-87
AB  - Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical procedure
      of choice for the management of ulcerative colitis. Pouchitis, a non-specific
      inflammation of the ileal reservoir, is the most frequent complication that
      patients experience in the long-term. Diagnosis should be made on the basis of
      clinical, endoscopic and histological aspects. The Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index (PDAI) represents an objective and reproducible scoring system for
      pouchitis: active pouchitis is defined as a score > or = 7 and remission as a
      score < 7. About 15% of patients develop a chronic disease. Treatment of
      pouchitis is empirical, and very few controlled studies have been carried out.
      Antibiotics, particularly metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are the treatment of
      choice. Chronic pouchitis may benefit from a prolonged course of a combination of
      antibiotics. Highly concentrated probiotics are effective for both prevention of 
      relapses and prevention of pouchitis onset. There is no convincing evidence of
      the efficacy of other therapeutic agents.

TI  - Novel therapies in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 483-90
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon of unknown
      cause. Its course is one of relapse and remission and requires therapy for both
      the induction and maintenance of remission. Progress in the fields of genetics
      and immunology affords important advances in our understanding of the
      inflammatory process. Traditional therapy for ulcerative colitis with nonspecific
      anti-inflammatories remains our gold standard. This review examines the most
      recent compounds in development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis,
      including data from early clinical trials and the potential clinical impact of
      future entities.

TI  - [Allergy-associated colitis. Characterization of an entity and its differential
      diagnoses].
PG  - 28-35
AB  - There is substantial evidence that allergic reactions exist in the
      gastrointestinal tract (GI). However, patients with food allergy-related
      enteropathy pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians because the clinical
      features are variable, unspecific, occur in other gastrointestinal disorders, and
      specific diagnostic tools are missing. Several recent studies and reviews have
      focused on the function of eosinophilic granulocytes in GI disease. The role of
      eosinophils in the pathophysiology of GI hypersensitivity reactions is poorly
      defined. However, some findings have been reported that imply an involvement of
      eosinophils in allergic reactions of the gut. The presumptive histology of
      allergy-associated colitis in colonic and ileal biopsies is based on prominent
      pure eosinophilic infiltration of a normal lamina propria, submucosa and
      epithelium with variable degrees of degranulation. An immunoperoxidase stain for 
      eosinophilic peroxidase is supportive in establishing the diagnosis if suspected.
      Neutrophils or mononuclear infiltrates are not significantly increased and damage
      to the intestinal tissue is not prominent. Despite characteristic histologic
      changes in colonic biopsy specimens, a final diagnosis depends on careful
      clinical examination and exclusion of several differential diagnoses.

TI  - Modification of intestinal flora in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 333-46
AB  - Because the intestinal microflora play an important role in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in the
      manipulation of the composition of the microflora towards a potentially more
      remedial community. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy
      of the manipulation of microflora by the use of prebiotics, probiotics,
      synbiotics, and antibiotics in IBD. Prebiotics, defined as nondigestible food
      ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the
      growth or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already
      resident in the colon, can modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the
      number of specific bacteria and thus changing the composition of the microbiota. 
      Prebiotics for IBD include lactosucrose, oligofructose, inulin, bran, psyllium,
      and germinated barley foodstuff (GBF). GBF, which mainly consists of dietary
      fiber and glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic foodstuff for ulcerative
      colitis. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient for
      colonocytes through Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium and also inactivate nuclear
      factor kappa B (NFkB). Moreover, it exhibits a potent water-holding capacity and 
      bile-acid binding capacity. Probiotics, which are microbial food supplements that
      beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, have 
      been used to change the composition of colonic microbiota. The approaches for IBD
      include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium-fermented
      milk. Use of Lactococci secreting IL-10 provides excellent results. The
      combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a synbiotic has not been studied in
      IBD but is promising. The use of antibiotics continues to be of interest.
      Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some
      settings, more clinical study is needed to firmly establish the relevance of
      these therapies.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of the effect of bifidobacteria-fermented milk on
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 56-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations of intestinal flora, such as reduction in the
      concentration of bifidobacteria and increase in that of Bacteroides species, are 
      apparently associated with the severity of ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: We
      conducted a randomised clinical trial of the use of a bifidobacteria-fermented
      milk (BFM) supplement as a dietary adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a group
      with BFM supplementation (BFM group, 11 subjects) and a control group (control
      group, 10 subjects). The BFM group was given 100 mL/day of BFM for one year.
      Colonoscopies, general blood markers and examinations of intestinal flora
      including the analysis of fecal organic acids were performed at the commencement 
      of the study and after one year. RESULTS: Exacerbation of symptoms was seen in 3 
      out of 11 subjects in the BFM group and in 9 out of 10 in the control group. Log 
      rank statistic analysis of the cumulative exacerbation rates showed a significant
      reduction in exacerbations for the BFM group (p = 0.0184). The analysis of
      microflora and the organic acids in the feces showed a significant reduction in
      the relative proportion of B. vulgatus in Bacteroidaceae and butyrate
      concentration, respectively, after supplementation with BFM, in comparison with
      before. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with the BFM product was successful in
      maintaining remission and had possible preventive effects on the relapse of
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - Use of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function.
      A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly
      demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live
      non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial
      balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this
      potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is 
      enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer.
      Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can
      prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical
      studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of
      remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an
      ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment
      of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively
      establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues
      such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple
      strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that
      treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative
      approaches are explored.

TI  - Detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in food.
PG  - 105-15
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli are emerging as a significant source of
      food-borne infectious disease all over the world. Illness caused by Shiga
      toxin-producing E. coli can range from self limited, watery diarrhea to
      life-threatening manifestations such as hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic
      syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and death. Shiga toxin-producing 
      E. coli can potentially enter the human food chain from a number of animal
      sources, most commonly by contamination of meat with feces or intestinal contents
      after slaughter or cross-contamination of unpasteurized milk products. Because of
      the low infectious dose of the O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strain,
      laboratory diagnosis of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in food samples has
      developed a great importance. This review will focus on the microorganism, giving
