TI  - Successful treatment for ulcerative proctitis with rectal tacrolimus in an
      8-year-old girl with intolerance to mesalamine.
PG  - 320-3

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is defined as a chronic inflammatory condition causing
      continuous mucosal inflammation of the colon without granulomas on biopsy. It
      affects the rectum, and, to a variable extent, the colon in continuity and is
      characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid
      (5-ASA) regimens are recommended as first-line induction therapy for mild to
      moderately active pediatric UC and for maintenance of remission regardless of
      other initial treatments. In large clinical trials in adults, mesalamine
      intolerance was found in 2-5 % of the patients. We present a case of an
      8-year-old female patient with intolerance to mesalamine and proctitis resistant 
      to conventional therapy who responded to rectal tacrolimus treatment. The patient
      started with a dose of 2 mg/day at night with an excellent response. She reported
      feeling better than any of the previously prescribed treatments and without
      feeling the discomfort of previously administered enemas. After four weeks of
      treatment, the dose was reduced to 2 mg/week with no relapses. Tacrolimus
      suppositories were very well tolerated, and no adverse effects have been
      reported. Although only very little data has been published, rectal tacrolimus
      seems to be safe and of efficacy in ulcerative proctitis resistant to standard
      therapy.

      vedolizumab.
PG  - 147-54
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S50348 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two chronic inflammatory bowel
      conditions. Current approved biologic therapies are limited to blocking tumor
      necrosis factor alpha. Unfortunately, some patients are primary nonresponders,
      experiencing a loss of response, intolerance, or side effects. This defines an
      unmet need for novel therapeutic strategies. The rapid recruitment and
      inappropriate retention of leukocytes is a hallmark of chronic inflammation and a
      potentially promising therapeutic target. Here we discuss the clinical trial
      results of vedolizumab (anti-alpha4beta7, LDP-02, MLN-02, and MLN0002) and its
      impact on future management of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Benefit of infliximab reintroduction after successive failure of infliximab and
      adalimumab in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 349-55
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jju024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab [IFX] and adalimumab [ADA] are effective in Crohn's
      disease [CD] for induction and maintenance therapy. However, high annual rate of 
      discontinuation for loss of response or intolerance may lead to a switch to
      another anti-tumor necrosis factor agent. Patients with successive failure to IFX
      and ADA are becoming more frequent. The aim of this study was to assess the
      efficacy and the tolerance of re-treatment with IFX in CD patients who
      successively failed IFX and ADA. METHODS: A total of 61 patients with CD who
      received and discontinued successively IFX and ADA, and who were re-exposed to
      IFX, were identified in four French tertiary centers and retrospectively
      analyzed. Clinical data, follow-up and outcome were abstracted from medical
      records. RESULTS: Median treatment duration after reintroduction was 16 months,
      and probability of remaining under IFX was 60% and 51%, respectively, at 12 and
      24 months. In all 29 patients discontinued the second IFX treatment due to
      intolerance [13], primary non-response [8], loss of response [7] or patient's
      wish [1]. Remission was achieved in 42% at week 6-8 after IFX re-induction, and
      was predictive of better long-term response [p = 0.006]. In multivariate
      analysis, receiving co-immunosuppression in both first and second IFX treatments 
      [p = 0.04] and shorter interval between first and second IFX treatments [p =
      0.017] were independently associated with longer duration of second IFX
      treatment. CONCLUSION: For CD patients who successively failed IFX and ADA,
      reintroducing IFX is feasible and often clinically efficient, particularly in
      patients who received co-immunosuppression during both first and second IFX
      treatments.

AB  - Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic
      colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient
      population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence 
      are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis
      and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal
      disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. 
      The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were
      analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of
      these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all
      patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had
      normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical
      history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome,
      juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most
      revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with
      lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved
      simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association
      is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the
      typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the
      patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement
      alone.

TI  - Granulo-monocyto apheresis is more effective in mild ulcerative colitis than in
      moderate to severe disease.
PG  - 17155-62
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i45.17155 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate whether the effectiveness of Granulo-monocyto apheresis (GMA), a
      technique that consists of the extracorporeal removal of granulocytes and
      monocytes from the peripheral blood, might vary according to the severity of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients with mild to moderate-severe disease UC
      activity. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data of
      patients undergoing GMA at our inflammatory bowel disease centre who had at least
      a 6 mo of follow-up. The demographics, clinical and laboratory data were
      extracted from the patients' charts and electronic records. The severity of UC
      was scored according to the Modified Truelove Witts Severity Index (MTWSI). A
      clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline of >/= 2 points or a
      value of MTWSI </= 2 points. RESULTS: A total of 41 (24 males/17 females; mean
      age 47 years) patients were included in the study. After GMA cycle completion,
      21/28 (75%) of mild UC patients showed a clinical response compared with 7/13
      (54%) of patients with moderate to severe disease (P = 0.27). At 6-mo, 14/28
      (50%) of the mild UC patients maintained a clinical response compared with 2/13
      (15%) of the patients with moderate to severe disease (P = 0.04). After the GMA
      cycle completion and during the 6-mo follow up period, 13/16 (81%) and 9/16 (56%)
      of mild UC patients with intolerance, resistance and contraindications to
      immunosuppressants and/or biologics showed a clinical response compared with 2/6 
      (33%) and 0/6 (0%) of patients with moderate to severe disease activity with
      these characteristics (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients
      with mild UC benefit from GMA more than patients with moderate to severe disease 
      in the short-term period. GMA should be considered a valid therapeutic option in 
      cases of contraindications to immunosuppressants, corticosteroids and/or
      biologics.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106750 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a defective
      intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal
      microbiota. Immune responses against food antigens in IBD patients remain poorly 
      defined. METHODS: IgG and IgA specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat
      and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis 
      lysates; mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by ELISA in the
      serum and feces of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 52 for serum and n = 20
      for feces), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29; n = 17), acute
      gastroenteritis/colitis (AGE; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls
      (n = 61; n = 39). RESULTS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) 
      and anti-B. fragilis IgG and IgA levels were increased in CD patients whereas
      antibody (Ab) levels against E. coli and food antigens were not significantly
      different within the patient groups and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that
      CD patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions
      have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial IgA levels whereas CD and UC
      patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food IgG levels. Treatment with
      anti-TNF-alpha Abs in CD patients was associated with significantly decreased
      ASCA IgG and IgA and anti-E. coli IgG. In the feces specific IgG levels against
      all antigens were higher in CD and AGE patients while specific IgA levels were
      higher in non-IBD patients. Anti-food IgG and IgA levels did not correlate with
      food intolerance. SUMMARY: In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, we found only minor
      changes in serum anti-food Ab levels in specific subgroups of IBD patients. Fecal
      Ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls,
      CD and UC patients.

TI  - Non-pulmonary allergic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease: a qualitative
      review.
PG  - 11023-32
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i32.11023 [doi]
AB  - While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological
      similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic
      phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers,
      pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic
      interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed.
      Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain
      allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD
      and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study.
      Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as
      well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially
      sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions 
      remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic
      disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and
      increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and
      allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be
      discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to
      IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological
      pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.

TI  - Calorie intake of enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes in acutely critically
      ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1177/0148607114544322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate calorie intake to be provided to critically ill
      patients via enteral nutrition (EN) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
      of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of initial underfeeding and
      full feeding in acutely critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared underfeeding
      with full feeding in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was overall
      mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of 
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, other infectious complications, and
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies were included in this 
      meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between
      the underfeeding and full-feeding groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74-1.19; I (2) = 26.6%; P = .61). Subgroup analysis of the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed >/=33.3% of the standard caloric requirement
      indicated that overall mortality was significantly lower in this underfeeding
      subgroup than in the full-feeding group (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.00; I (2) = 0%;
      P = .05). In contrast, no difference in overall mortality was noted between the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed <33.3% of the standard caloric requirement and
      the full-feeding group. The length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay did
      not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, no differences in other secondary
      clinical outcomes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: None of the analyzed clinical outcomes
      for the acutely critically ill patients were significantly influenced by the
      calorie intake of the initial EN.

TI  - Disaccharidase activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 185-91
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.3994 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      multifactorial and not well explained. Environmental, genetic, and dietary
      factors play an important role. The aim of the study was the evaluation of
      lactase, saccharase, and maltase activity in patients with IBD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The study comprised 65 children, aged 3-18 years. During a routine
      endoscopy, we took biopsies from the descending part of the duodenum. In these
      biopsies, we determined disaccharidase activity using Dahlquist's method.
      RESULTS: Decreased lactase activity in the biopsies taken from the small
      intestine mucosa was most frequently observed in patients with Crohn's disease
      (5/15-33%) and least frequently seen in children with lymphocytic colitis (in
      1/10-10%). The lowest mean values of lactase activity were found in the children 
      with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (1.7-2.5 U/1 g). Decreased saccharase
      activity in the biopsies obtained from the small intestine mucosa was most
      frequently observed in patients with lymphocytic colitis (in 5/10-50%) and
      ulcerative colitis (9/20-45%) and least frequently seen in children with
      non-specific undetermined colitis (in 7/20-35%). Decreased maltase activity in
      the small bowel mucosa was the most frequently observed in patients with Crohn's 
      disease (in 5/15-33%) and least frequently seen in children with ulcerative
      colitis (in 3/20-15%). The lowest mean values of maltase activity were found in
      the children with Crohn's disease (5.4 U/1 g). CONCLUSION: Therefore, it seems
      reasonable to perform diagnostic examinations aimed at lactose, saccharose, and
      maltose intolerance and to initiate a dietary regimen in children with IBD.

AB  - Vedolizumab [Entyvio((R)) (US, Europe)], a humanized monoclonal antibody
      alpha4beta7 integrin receptor antagonist, has been developed by Millennium
      Pharmaceuticals (d/b/a Takeda Pharmaceuticals International) for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Vedolizumab has received its first global
      approval for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the US,
      for use in adult patients with moderate-to-severe disease who have had an
      inadequate response, loss of response or intolerance to one or more standard
      therapies (corticosteroids, immunomodulators or tumour necrosis factor-alpha
      inhibitor) or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids. Vedolizumab has since
      been approved for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the EU, Norway,
      Iceland and Liechtenstein. This article summarizes the milestones in the
      development of vedolizumab leading to its first approval for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Relapsing and refractory ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 419-26
LID - 10.1159/000358148 [doi]
AB  - Approximately half of the children with ulcerative colitis (UC) have refractory, 
      relapsing or steroid-dependent disease. UC in children is more extensive than in 
      adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive
      disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in 
      UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid
      dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every
      resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease
      activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment,
      infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose
      intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be
      ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization
      of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate
      dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors
      and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when
      indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to
      become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed
      before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when
      all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of
      refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and
      this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in
      this setup.

TI  - Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus in ulcerative colitis: pathogenetic and
      therapeutic implications.
PG  - 3507-15
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i13.3507 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is one of the most frequent co-morbidities of ulcerative
      colitis patients. The epidemiological association of these diseases suggested a
      genetic sharing and has challenged gene identification. Diabetes co-morbidity in 
      ulcerative colitis has also relevant clinical and therapeutic implications, with 
      potential clinical impact on the follow up and outcome of patients. These
      diseases share specific complications, such as neuropathy, hepatic steatosis,
      osteoporosis and venous thrombosis. It is still unknown whether the coexistence
      of these diseases may increase their occurrence. Diabetes and hyperglycaemia
      represent relevant risk factors for postoperative complications and pouch failure
      in ulcerative colitis. Medical treatment of ulcerative colitis in patients with
      diabetes mellitus may be particularly challenging. Corticosteroids are the
      treatment of choice of active ulcerative colitis. Their use may be associated
      with the onset of glucose intolerance and diabetes, with difficult control of
      glucose levels and with complications in diabetic patients. Epidemiologic and
      genetic evidences about diabetes co-morbidity in ulcerative colitis patients and 
      shared complications and treatment of patients with these diseases have been
      discussed in the present review.

TI  - Mucosal healing with thalidomide in refractory Crohn's disease patients
      intolerant of anti-TNF-alpha drugs: report of 3 cases and literature review.
PG  - 530-3
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000122 [doi]
AB  - Thalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory drug with antitumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activity. Several case reports and some
      clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of refractory
      Crohn's disease (CD). We report the effect and tolerability of thalidomide in 3
      patients with moderate-to-severe CD who were not responsive to anti-TNF-alpha
      therapies, and review the relevant literature. The first case is of a 28-year-old
      female affected by Crohn's colitis complicated by a severe fistulizing perianal
      disease; she was treated with infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol,
      which were stopped because of intolerance. The second case is of a 39-year-old
      female with fistulizing ileocolitis complicated by severe arthralgias and
      perianal disease with loss of response to infliximab and intolerance of
      certolizumab pegol. The third case is of a 39-year-old male with gastric and
      ileocolonic CD refractory to immunosuppressors and intolerant of infliximab. All 
      the 3 cases achieved complete clinical remission and endoscopic healing of
      mucosal lesions at a low dose of thalidomide (50 to 150 mg/d). In our CD patients
      who experienced loss of response or were unable to tolerate anti-TNF-alpha drugs,
      thalidomide was an effective and well-tolerated therapy for inducing and
      maintaining long-term remission.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by
      intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated 
      to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free
      diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains
      unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS
      have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a 
      response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been 
      postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This
      review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of
      different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper
      screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A significant proportion of patients with initial response to
      Inflximab (IFX), subsequently lose response (LOR). Multicentre paediatric studies
      report LOR in 33% to 50% with 3-5year follow-up. Our retrospective study examined
      durability of response and predictors of LOR. METHODS: From our IBD database of
      185 children with CD, 65 received IFX maintenance therapy for luminal or
      fistulising Crohn's disease between January, 2006 and April, 2013. 47 with
      luminal CD >/=1year follow-up after commencing IFX were included. We evaluated
      variables associated with response and describe outcomes on those remaining on
      IFX at four time points; before IFX, after induction, at 1year and at the last
      follow-up. Response was divided into sustained primary, recovered, durable
      (combined sustained primary and recovered) and complete LOR (discontinuation from
      LOR or intolerance). RESULTS: Overall, 28/47 (60%) children sustained primary
      response over a median duration of 2.83years (1.6-4.4, IQR). 19/47 (40%)
      developed LOR (including 2 intolerant) at a median of 11months (9-19, IQR). Of 17
      with LOR, 7 were successfully re-induced giving durable response (35/47, 74%); 6 
      failed dose intensification needing surgery (n=2), second anti-TNF (n=2) or both 
      (n=2). 4 had surgery without dose intensification. LOR was associated with low
      BMI at diagnosis, lower height Z scores prior to induction, elevated CRP
      following induction (p=0.007) and failure to use concomitant IM (p=0.02).
      CONCLUSION: The cumulative probability of durable response to IFX in luminal CD
      was 83%, 74% and 70% after 1, 2, and 3years on IFX maintenance therapy.

TI  - Risks of inflammatory bowel disease treatment with glucocorticosteroids and
      aminosalicylates.
PG  - 368-73
LID - 10.1159/000354699 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucocorticosteroids and aminosalicylates, mainly mesalazine (5-ASA),
      are both standard therapeutics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients. The glucocorticosteroids are highly effective in inducing
      remission in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, but their use is
      limited by the high incidence and the potentially serious nature of adverse
      events. In an attempt to limit systemic side effects, rapidly metabolized
      corticosteroids such as budesonide have been introduced. The safety profile of
      aminosalicylates differs between the formulations. METHODS: We summarize the
      potential risks associated with glucocorticosteroid and aminosalicylate therapy
      in IBDs. RESULTS: The numerous adverse events of glucocorticosteroids,
      particularly at high doses and prolonged treatment, include opportunistic
      infections, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ocular effects (glaucoma and
      cataracts), psychiatric complications, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
      suppression and increased fracture risk. Partially, these systemic adverse events
      occur with budesonide, which only has a low systemic exposure. The safety profile
      of 5-ASA is comparable to placebo and superior to the old aminosalicylate prodrug
      sulfasalazine, which had a significantly higher incidence of intolerance
      reactions including allergic rashes. Only in rare cases has nephrotoxicity such
      as interstitial nephritis been associated with 5-ASA. CONCLUSION: Considering the
      toxicity profile of conventional glucocorticosteroids, one primary goal of
      treatment in IBD should be corticosteroid-free remission. Therapy with budesonide
      may result in a better safety profile. 5-ASA treatment is usually well tolerated,
      but with regard to the rare nephrotoxic events, it is advisable to assess renal
      function before and during treatment with 5-ASA.

TI  - The long-term efficacy of azathioprine in steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1386-93
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.845908 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The long-term efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) in steroid-dependent
      ulcerative colitis (UC) is still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of
      AZA in patients with steroid-dependent UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We
      retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 106 patients with
      steroid-dependent UC who were administered AZA. Three-year outcomes of AZA
      therapy were evaluated. The outcome of the treatment was defined as (1) success, 
      indicating induction and maintenance of remission throughout the study period
      (complete success) or remission followed by infrequent and short relapses
      (partial success); or (2) failure, indicating the absence of remission, frequent 
      or prolonged relapses, infliximab administration, or colectomy. RESULTS. Of the
      106 patients, 73 (68.9%) continued on AZA for >6 months (AZA therapy group) and
      33 (31.1%) discontinued AZA within 6 months due to intolerance (AZA intolerance
      group, n = 20), colectomy (n = 6), or follow-up loss (n = 7). Three-year outcomes
      for 106 patients were success in 54.7% (complete success, 35.8%; partial success,
      18.9%), failure in 32.1% (frequent or prolonged relapses, 12.3%; infliximab
      administration, 5.6%; colectomy, 14.2%), and follow-up loss or death in 13.2%.
      The success rate increased to 71.2% (complete success, 46.6%; partial success,
      24.7%) when the analysis was confined to the 73 patients who continued AZA for > 
      6 months. The 3-year success rate was higher in the AZA therapy group (71.2%)
      than the AZA intolerance group (25.0%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. AZA is an
      effective treatment for steroid-dependent UC. The efficacy of AZA is well
      sustained over 3 years.

TI  - A trial of mercaptopurine is a safe strategy in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease intolerant to azathioprine: an observational study, systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1255-66
LID - 10.1111/apt.12511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiopurines maintain remission and modify disease course in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Use is limited by intolerance and subsequent drug
      withdrawal in approximately 17% of patients treated with azathioprine. Previous
      case series have addressed the success rates of re-treatment with mercaptopurine 
      in these individuals. AIMS: To determine the rate of tolerance when trialling
      mercaptopurine in azathioprine-intolerant patients and the factors predictive of 
      success, and to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of these data with 
      other published data sets. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of 149
      patients with IBD (82 with Crohn's disease and 67 with ulcerative colitis)
      previously intolerant of azathioprine subsequently treated with mercaptopurine
      was performed. A meta-analysis was undertaken of all published studies of
      mercaptopurine use in azathioprine-intolerant patients (455 patients in 11
      included studies). RESULTS: Mercaptopurine was tolerated by 58% of
      azathioprine-intolerant patients in the Edinburgh cohort. In the meta-analysis,
      68% tolerated mercaptopurine. A higher proportion of those in the meta-analysis
      with GI toxicity (62%) or hepatotoxicity (81%) were able to tolerate
      mercaptopurine than those with flu-like illness (36%). Among those patients who
      ceased mercaptopurine for further adverse effects, 59% experienced the same
      adverse effect as they had with azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis
      shows that switching to mercaptopurine is a safe therapeutic strategy for over
      two-thirds of azathioprine-intolerant patients and may help optimise
      immunomodulatory therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. A trial of mercaptopurine
      should be attempted in IBD patients (except those with acute pancreatitis or bone
      marrow aplasia) before considering thiopurine intolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from
      several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium
      in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food
      questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and 
      age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake
      was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD 
      mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD
      mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease
      (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative
      colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0).
      CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In
      all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of
      lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs
      114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in 
      IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls.
      Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate
      calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to
      dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake.
      Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents 
      a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored
      nutritional advice in IBD.

TI  - Pediatric and adult celiac disease: similarities and differences.
PG  - 283-8
LID - 10.1007/s12664-013-0339-9 [doi]
AB  - Differences between children and adults in celiac disease (CD) presentation and
      epidemiology are reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, histological changes,
      serology, and response to gluten-free diet are similar. Differences exist in
      epidemiology, type of clinical presentations, coexisting diseases, complications,
      and association with obesity. CD is two to five times more common in children
      than in adults. Classical CD with gastrointestinal symptoms is more common in
      children whereas nonclassical CD dominates in adults. A gene dose phenomenon
      (double-dose HLA-DQB1 02 allele) is postulated to be responsible for this
      difference. Coexisting autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1,
      Sjogren's syndrome, and dermatitis herpetiformis are more common in adults than
      in children (42 % vs. 5 %). The association of overweight/obesity and CD is
      stronger in adults than in children (22.5 % vs. 14 %). Besides poor compliance,
      pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, irritable
      bowel syndrome, lymphocytic colitis, and microscopic colitis are considered
      responsible for nonresponsive CD in adults but not in children. Complications
      like refractory sprue and small intestinal neoplasms are seen exclusively in
      adults. Existing diagnostic criteria (modified ESPGHAN) are not suitable for
      diagnosing CD in adults as the majority of cases are either nonclassical or
      subclinical CD.

TI  - Semiquantitative assessment of breath hydrogen testing.
PG  - 1450-6
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: A major use of breath hydrogen testing is to assess
      absorptive capacity for sugars to assist dietary design for management of gut
      symptoms. Qualitative reporting takes no account of the vigor of hydrogen
      response and provides little insight into degrees of malabsorption. This study
      aimed to describe a semiquantitative reporting method and to compare results with
      those reported qualitatively. METHODS: In consecutive Caucasian patients with
      Crohn's disease (n = 87), ulcerative colitis (59), functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGID) (162), and healthy controls (76), area under the curve was
      calculated for lactulose (15 g). This was compared with that for lactose (50 g)
      and fructose (35 g). Degree of malabsorption was categorized into arbitrary
      groups. RESULTS: Semiquantitative results for >/= 30% (designated "convincing")
      malabsorption was most similar to those using a qualitative cutoff value of 20
      ppm, but in 38% and 21% of patients, the classification of malabsorption (nil or 
      clinically significant) changed for fructose and lactose, respectively. Using a
      cutoff of 10 ppm, 49% and 5% were classified differently. Crohn's disease had a
      higher prevalence (42%) of convincing fructose malabsorption than controls (24%) 
      or patients with FGID (33%) (P < 0.02). Highest prevalence of convincing lactose 
      malabsorption (38%) was in ulcerative colitis, greater than controls (18%) and
      FGID (18%) (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative assessment provides
      different results with different clinical implications in more than one third of 
      patients, but disease-related alterations in prevalence are similar to those
      defined qualitatively. This method may be preferable because it lessens the
      confounding influence of the vigor of the hydrogen response.

LID - 10.1111/apt.12261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) is a common chronic diarrhoeal disease, and 
      remission can be induced with budesonide. However, diarrhoea relapses frequently 
      when budesonide is tapered and a few patients become budesonide intolerant. AIM: 
      To examine retrospectively the effect of azathioprine (AZA) and mercaptopurine
      (MP) in patients with chronic, active MC. METHODS/PATIENTS: Data on all MC
      patients who received AZA or MP in the years 1997-2011 at three centres
      representing three countries were pooled for analysis. The indications for
      thiopurine therapy were frequent relapses after short-term treatment (N = 26),
      budesonide dependency on 6 mg (N = 15) and budesonide intolerance (N = 5). The
      response to thiopurine treatment was defined as clinical remission, intolerance
      or nonresponse. RESULTS: Forty-six MC patients (32 CC and 14 LC), 32 female;
      median age 59 years (range: 36-83) with a median disease duration of 3 years
      (range: 0.5-18) were included. Thirteen patients (28%) achieved long-term
      clinical remission on AZA therapy. AZA failed in 31 patients (67%) due to
      intolerance and in 2 patients (4%) because of nonresponse. Thirteen of 31
      AZA-intolerant patients were switched to MP and 6 patients (46%) obtained
      clinical remission. Thus, the overall response rate to thiopurines was 19/46
      (41%). The main side effects were nausea/vomiting and abnormally elevated liver
      enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective case series, the majority of chronic,
      active MC patients were intolerant to AZA leading to cessation of treatment.
      However, further studies are needed to explore the efficacy, acceptance,
      tolerance and safety of MP in patients with chronic, active MC refractory to
      budesonide.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Over 10% of Crohn's disease (CD) patients annually lose
      response to infliximab. Infliximab trough levels (TL), concomitant
      immunosuppressants and endoscopic healing were proposed as predictors of
      favourable infliximab outcome. We assessed infliximab TL measured after induction
      therapy as predictors of sustained clinical response. Furthermore, we tried to
      identify other predictors of long-term benefit of infliximab therapy. METHODS: We
      included CD patients treated with infliximab between October 2007 and March 2010 
      who responded to 3-dose induction followed by maintenance therapy and in whom
      blood samples taken at treatment week 14 or 22 were available in blood bank.
      Sustained response to infliximab was defined as absence of treatment failure due 
      to loss of response or drug intolerance. RESULTS: Eighty four patients were
      included. Sustained response to infliximab was observed in 47 (56%) patients
      during a median follow-up of 25 months (14-37). Infliximab TL>3mug/ml were
      associated with a decreased risk of treatment failure (HR 0.34; 95% CI:
      0.16-0.75), whereas the presence of antibodies against infliximab and need for
      corticosteroids increased this risk (HR 4.34; 95% CI: 1.51-12.5 and HR 2.49, 95% 
      CI: 1.08-5.73, respectively). No impact of concomitant thiopurines was observed, 
      although patients receiving thiopurines had higher infliximab TL than those
      without immunomodulators (5.51 vs. 0.71mug/ml; p=0.01). CONCLUSION: During a
      median follow up of 2 years sustained response to infliximab was observed in
      slightly more than half of CD patients. Infliximab TL>3mug/ml at the start of
      maintenance regime were predicative of sustained response to infliximab.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of long-term allopurinol-thiopurine maintenance
      treatment in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 363-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.23021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiopurines are the mainstay of conventional maintenance therapy in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unfortunately, up to 50% of patients
      discontinue immunosuppressive therapy within 2 years due to intolerance or lack
      of efficacy. Allopurinol with low-dose thiopurine can optimize thiopurine
      metabolism for IBD patients with preferential shunting toward 6-methyl
      mercaptopurine (6-MMP) formation. The aim of this study was to assess long-term
      maintenance effectiveness and tolerability of allopurinol-thiopurine therapy in a
      larger multicenter cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Enrolled patients who failed 
      monotherapy with thiopurines due to a skewed metabolism were subsequently treated
      with a combination therapy of allopurinol and low-dose thiopurine. Adverse events
      were monitored and therapeutic adherence was assessed. Seventy-seven IBD patients
      were enrolled with a mean follow-up of 19 months. RESULTS: The median
      6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration increased from 145 during monotherapy to
      271 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cell (RBC) after at least 8 weeks of combination
      therapy while reducing the thiopurine dosage (P < 0.001). In contrast, median
      6-MMP concentrations decreased from 10,110 to 265 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC (P < 0.001).
      Leukopenia occurred in 12 patients (16%), requiring dose adaptation. Liver test
      abnormalities normalized in 81% of patients after the addition of allopurinol.
      Sixteen (21%) patients had to discontinue combination therapy. The percentage of 
      patients still using combination therapy at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months was 87%,
      85%, 76%, and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term combination therapy with 
      allopurinol and low-dose thiopurines is an effective and well-tolerated treatment
      in IBD patients with a skewed thiopurine metabolism.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody to
      TNF-alpha. There are limited data with regard to its efficacy in ulcerative
      colitis. We report experience of adalimumab in ulcerative colitis in a single
      centre with a focus on the ability of this agent to maintain response and avoid
      colectomy in the medium to long-term. METHODS: Twenty-three ulcerative colitis
      patients (mean age 32 years; 7 female) who received adalimumab were identified
      from a prospectively maintained database of over 2700 IBD patients. The primary
      study endpoint was treatment failure defined as discontinuation of adalimumab due
      to lack of efficacy, as defined by requiring an alternative maintenance therapy
      or colectomy, or intolerance. Colectomy rate was recorded as a secondary
      endpoint. RESULTS: Most patients (96%) had received immunosuppressants prior to
      adalimumab therapy (infliximab 20/23 87%). Sixteen of 23 patients (70%)
      discontinued adalimumab. Six primary failures, 8 secondary loss of response, one 
      had unacceptable side effects and one discontinued treatment after 6 months but
      remains in remission. Overall estimated cumulative treatment failure rates at 6, 
      12 and 24 months were 50%, 65% and 72% respectively. Median follow-up in patients
      continuing adalimumab is 23 months (IQR 17-31 months). Treatment failure was
      unrelated to patient age, gender, disease extent, smoking status or CRP.
      Colectomy free survival was 59% at 2 years. No patient experienced a major
      adverse event. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab shows some efficacy as a maintenance
      strategy in Ulcerative Colitis, but only a limited proportion of patients remain 
      well on continued treatment at 2 years.

AB  - Several drugs are currently available to maintain remission in patients who have 
      responded after one or other type of induction therapy, depending on the initial 
      severity of the outbreak. Salicylates are the drugs of choice to maintain
      remission after a mild-to-moderate outbreak controlled by salicylates or oral
      corticosteroids. To maintain remission after a severe outbreak or in patients
      with corticosteroid dependence or resistance, thiopurines are the drugs of
      choice. In patients who have failed to respond to thiopurines and in those with
      thiopurine intolerance, biological agents, mainly infliximab, can be used to
      maintain remission in patients after induction therapy with infliximab for a
      severe outbreak. However, these scenarios may not reflect reality of
      gastroenterologists' daily clinical practice. Treatment will therefore be based
      on the patient's individual characteristics (age, clinical course, previous
      treatment, adverse effects and personal preferences) as well as the physician's
      medical art.
