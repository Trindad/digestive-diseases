TI  - Responses of people with inflammatory bowel disease to foods consumed.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the reactions of people with IBD to foods
      consumed. A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the
      disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list 
      was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27
      persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and
      their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and
      winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were
      identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with 
      IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different
      according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure
      to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the
      data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that
      had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.

TI  - [Oral nutritional supplements. Are they useful?].
PG  - 49-57
AB  - Oral nutritional supplements are products included in enteral nutrition,
      preferably used in hospital settings, although their use in the community is
      gradually increasing and in the United Kingdom has doubled in the last seven
      years, with prescriptions covering a wide range of the population from children
      to the elderly, and different pathologies affecting their nutritional status.
      There is, however, no consensus on the usefulness of oral nutritional supplements
      among these patients, so we do not have any recommendations for use. In this
      paper we have reviewed the various studies available in the literature in order
      to clarify the usefulness of these supplements in different contexts or
      pathologies.

TI  - Oral nutritional supplementation is effective in the maintenance of remission in 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral feeding with either elemental or polymeric diets is an
      established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. However, the role of
      supplementing normal food with elemental diet in the long-term management of
      Crohn's disease has hitherto not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of
      39 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission were studied. 
      Of these, 21 patients (Group 1) received oral nutritional supplementation, taken 
      in addition to their normal diet. Their outcome (relapse rate, Crohn's disease
      activity index, inflammatory markers) was compared with that of 18 patients
      (Group 2), who were maintained on a normal unrestricted diet over an observation 
      period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (81%) tolerated the
      nutritional supplementation. On an intention-to-treat basis, 10 patients (48%)
      remained in remission for 12 months, compared to 4/18 (22%) patients in Group 2, 
      p<0.0003. Their Crohn's disease activity index and CRP remained stable while
      their weight and body mass index improved during the period of nutrition therapy 
      Seven patients in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2 relapsed at a mean of 7.4+/-0.9 and
      6.2+/-0.4 months, respectively. The response to nutrition supplement was
      independent of age, sex, disease duration or location. Four patients (19%) were
      intolerant to enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation is safe, 
      well tolerated and effective in the long-term management of patients with
      quiescent Crohn's disease.

TI  - Decreased anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody titer by mesalazine in patients 
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1400-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae may contribute to the pathophysiology of
      Crohn's disease. We determined serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody
      (ASCA) levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCA was measured by using an ELISA in serum samples from 
      19 patients with ulcerative colitis, 18 patients with Crohn's disease and 7
      healthy controls. The ASCA level was significantly higher in patients with
      ulcerative colitis and patients with Crohn's disease than in controls, and was
      significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease compared with patients with
      ulcerative colitis. Age, gender, disease activity, extent of disease and small
      bowel involvement each did not affect ASCA levels. The use of elemental or
      polymeric diet therapy for Crohn's disease and administration of corticosteroids 
      to patients with inflammatory bowel disease also did not affect ASCA levels. The 
      ASCA titer was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease taking
      mesalazine than in those not taking it, although, serum IgG levels did not differ
      between these two groups, which might imply a suppression of IgG production by
      mesalazine at the intestinal level. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased serum
      ASCA titers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease suggests that
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae may play a role in the pathophysiology of this
      condition.

PG  - 339-44
AB  - Recent developments concerning nutritional complications of inflammatory bowel
      disease include a better understanding of disease-associated anorexia and
      increasing recognition of the interaction of nutrition and cytokines in the
      pathogenesis of growth impairment of children. Decreased bone mineral density is 
      a multifactorial complication and an increased focus of research. Enteral
      nutrition continues to play an important role in the therapy of Crohn's disease. 
      The mechanisms whereby specific nutrients, such as n-3 fatty acids, antioxidants,
      and butyrate, ameliorate inflammation are being elucidated in in-vitro studies,
      but beneficial effects have yet to be translated into the clinical sphere.

PG  - 747-56
AB  - Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as
      non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD,
      mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is 
      also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a
      population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A 
      substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is
      reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an
      increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults.
      However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The
      etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and
      antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made
      in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the
      disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system 
      in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual.
      The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 
      4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 
      activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral.
      Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and
      nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious
      diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of
      nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations
      nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD.
      Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. 
      Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents,
      biologic agents and role of surgery.

AB  - A 24-year-old woman had Crohn's colitis which had been diagnosed in 1997. The
      patient was given sulfazalazine and responded well. Antiendomysial and
      antigliadin antibodies were positive. Diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed
      by duodenal biopsy showing villous atrophy and an increased number of lymphocytes
      infiltrating the epithelium. Few cases associating Crohn's disease and celiac
      disease have been reported. This case illustrates the complexity of the
      pathogenic mechanisms in these two disease. Our patient required a gluten-free
      diet although the celiac disease was asymptomatic, basically to avoid the risk of
      malignancy associated with celiac disease.

TI  - The epidemiology and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 154-67
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. However, a
      satisfactory solution cannot be far away. IBD actually encompasses two diseases, 
      i.e. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerous colitis (UC). These diseases resemble each
      other so closely that they cannot be distinguished even pathologically, but
      differ from each other sufficiently to regard them as independent entities.
      Epidemiological observations may be helpful in identifying the true causative
      factors of this evasive disease. Geographically, the prevalence of the disease
      has a slope from North to South and, to a lesser degree, from West to East. The
      Western-Eastern discrepancy can be attributed to a difference in Western life
      styles. The incidence of the disease has been increasing world-wide of late, but 
      its spread has been slowing down in highly affected countries. Racial and ethnic 
      relations in different populations and immigration studies offer interesting data
      which can reflect genetic, inherited, environmental and behavioural factors. The 
      disease seems to have a characteristic racial-ethnic distribution: the Jewish
      population is highly susceptible everywhere, but its prevalence in that
      population nears that of the domestic society in which they live. In Hungary, the
      Roma (Gypsies) have a considerably lower prevalence than the average population. 
      This can be attributed to a genetic or environmental influence. According to age,
      the onset of the disease occurs more often in the second or the third decade of
      life, but there also is another peak in the 60s. Regarding sexual distribution,
      there is a slight preponderance of colitis ulcerosa in men and of Crohn's disease
      in women. It may correspond to the stronger auto-immune affection in the process 
      of Crohn's disease. Environmental factors and behavioural influences also are
      investigated. Diet, the role of the early ages, smoking habits and the influence 
      of hormonal status and drugs are viewed as useful contributing factors in the
      manifestation of the disease. Genetic studies show that one-fourth of IBD
      patients have an affected family member. HLAB27 histocombatibility also plays an 
      important, but not determining role in the development of the disease. Genetic
      factors seem to have a stronger influence in Crohn's disease than ulcerative
      colitis. The existence of multiple sclerosis-IBD families may reflect the common 
      genetic background or the similar microbial effect as well. A great number of
      bacterial and viral factors has been suspected of being infectious factors in
      IBD, mostly in CD. Mycobacteria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Clamidias,
      etc. as well as bacteria and some viruses such as herpes and rotavirus and the
      primary measles virus. None of them has been proven as a real and exclusively
      pathogenic factor. Immunological background has an important function in the
      manifestation of the disease. If an individual has a genetic susceptibility to
      infections, the down regulation of an inflammation in the bowel wall does not
      occur in a proper way. This initiates the auto-immune process which is a
      self-increasing cycle. Extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD are of high
      importance because they can not only follow intestinal symptoms, but precede them
      by years. Hepatic and biliary disturbances (primary sclerosing cholangitis), are 
      the most serious complications. Mucocutaneous manifestations can be the first
      appearance of the main disease (in the mouth). Auto-immune consequences (erythema
      nodosum) or complications caused even by the therapy can occur. Ocular and
      musculoskeletal manifestations supposedly have the same genetic background and
      often precede the intestinal symptoms. Considering the epidemiological, genetic
      and immunological data, we can conclude that ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are heterogeneous disorders of mutifactorial etiology in which hereditary
      (genetic) and environmental (microbial, behaviour) factors interact to produce
      the disease.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in recently diagnosed patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease compared with population controls.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with
      recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a
      comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD
      patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched
      population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status
      was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of
      nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight
      and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with
      controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD
      patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were
      significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum
      concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc)
      were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12
      concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not
      significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected
      negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional
      supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical
      course of the disease.

PG  - 2122-6
AB  - Osteoporosis is known to be associated with Crohn's disease. We report a
      12-yr-old boy without a history of steroid use, in whom severe osteoporosis and
      multiple collapsed vertebrae were the presenting manifestations of Crohn's
      disease. After treatment of the Crohn's disease, he resumed normal growth and
      progressed through puberty. Concomitantly, he demonstrated a substantial recovery
      of vertebral bone mineral density and structure. Possible pathophysiological
      mechanisms underlying the osteoporosis and the subsequent improvement in bone
      density are discussed.

TI  - A preliminary study of growth hormone therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1633-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel. In a
      preliminary study, we evaluated whether the administration of growth hormone
      (somatropin) as well as a high-protein diet would ameliorate the symptoms of the 
      disease. METHODS: We randomly assigned 37 adults with moderate-to-severe active
      Crohn's disease to four months of self-administered injections of growth hormone 
      (loading dose, 5 mg per day subcutaneously for one week, followed by a
      maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per day) or placebo. We instructed all patients to
      increase their protein intake to at least 2 g per kilogram of body weight per
      day. Patients continued to be treated by their usual physicians and to receive
      other medications for Crohn's disease. The primary end point was the change in
      scores on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index from base line to month 4. Scores
      can range from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.
      RESULTS: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) score on the Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index was somewhat higher among the 19 patients in the growth hormone group than 
      among the 18 patients in the placebo group (287+/-134 vs. 213+/-120, P=0.09).
      Three patients in the placebo group withdrew before their first follow-up visit
      and were not included in the data analysis. At four months, the Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index score had decreased by a mean of 143+/-144 points in the growth
      hormone group, as compared with a decrease of 19+/-63 points in the placebo group
      (P=0.004). Side effects in the growth hormone group included edema (in 10
      patients) and headache (in 5) and usually resolved within the first month of
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study suggests that growth hormone may be
      a beneficial treatment for patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a scientific rationale?
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host
      immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease
      pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food
      ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on
      health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence
      from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and
      intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause 
      and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous
      research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of
      probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be
      fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic
      heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed
      that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although
      preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in
      treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified.
      However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification
      of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future,
      probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis
      on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional
      role.

TI  - Nutritional supplementation with N-3 fatty acids and antioxidants in patients
      with Crohn's disease in remission: effects on antioxidant status and fatty acid
      profile.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - In patients with Crohn's disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is
      generally accepted to be an important issue. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effects of 3 months of supplementation with a liquid formula
      containing either antioxidants (AO) or n-3 fatty acids plus AO on the antioxidant
      status and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue,
      respectively, in patients with long-standing CD currently in remission. In a
      randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, CD patients received either
      placebo, AO, or n-3 fatty acids plus AO for 3 months in addition to their regular
      diet. In all, 25/37 CD patients completed the study. AO status was assessed by
      blood biochemical parameters. A statistical per-protocol analysis was performed. 
      Serum concentrations of selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E, the activity of
      superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant status were significantly (p < 0.05)
      increased after AO supplementation. Furthermore, compared with controls, serum
      concentrations of beta-carotene, selenium, and vitamin C and the activity of
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower before
      supplementation; however, after AO supplementation these levels were not
      significantly different from controls (except for GPx). N-3 fatty acids plus AO
      supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the proportion of arachidonic 
      acid, and increased the proportion of eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic
      acid in both plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue. Supplementation with
      antioxidants improved antioxidant status in patients with CD in remission. In
      addition, supplementation with n-3 fatty acids plus antioxidants significantly
      changed the eicosanoid precursor profile, which may lead to the production of
      eicosanoids with attenuated proinflammatory activity. This study indicates that
      an immunomodulating formula containing n-3 fatty acids and/or AO may have the
      potential to play a role in the treatment of CD.

TI  - Laparoscopic colectomy compares favorably with colectomy by laparotomy for
      reduction of postoperative ileus.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the length of postoperative ileus
      in patients undergoing colectomy by either laparotomy or laparoscopy. METHODS: A 
      total of 166 patients were studied. These patients were divided into two groups: 
      Group 1, in which colectomy was done laparoscopically, and Group 2, consisting of
      patients undergoing laparotomy. Both groups contained 83 patients who were
      matched for disease severity, indications for surgery, and procedure. Indications
      for surgery included sigmoid diverticulitis in 12 (14 percent) patients, polyps
      in 22 (27 percent), Crohn's disease in 21 (25 percent), colorectal cancer in 11
      (13 percent), stoma reversal in 8 (10 percent), rectal prolapse in 3 (4 percent),
      and other indications in 6 (7 percent) in each group. Operations were colectomy
      with anastomosis (42 ileocolic, 26 colorectal, 6 colocolic, 4 ileorectal, and 2
      ileal J pouch) or without anastomosis (3 abdominoperineal resections) performed
      by the same surgeons during the same time period January 1993 to October 1996).
      The nasogastric tube was removed from all patients immediately after surgery in
      both groups. All patients received a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative
      day, followed by a regular diet as tolerated. The nasogastric tube was reinserted
      if two or more episodes of emesis of more than 200 ml occurred in the absence of 
      bowel movement. Patients were discharged from the hospital when tolerating a
      regular diet without evidence of ileus. Statistical analysis was performed using 
      unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact probability test. RESULTS: The male-to-female 
      ratio was 38 to 45 in both groups. A total of 10 (12 percent) and 23 (28 percent)
      patients in Group 1 and Group 2 had emesis (P = 0.02), and the rate of
      nasogastric tube reinsertion was 5 (6 percent) and 13 (16 percent), respectively 
      (P > 0.05). There were significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 relative to
      the lengths of ileus (3.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.7 days, respectively; P < 0.001),
      hospitalization (6.6 +/- 3.3 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.5 days, respectively; P < 0.002), and 
      operative time (170 +/- 60 vs. 114 +/- 46 minutes, respectively; P < 0.001). The 
      morbidity rate was 16 (19.2 percent) and 18 (21.6 percent) in the laparoscopy and
      laparotomy groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although early oral intake is safe 
      and can be tolerated by 84 percent of patients after colectomy by laparotomy,
      laparoscopic colectomy reduced the lengths of both postoperative ileus and
      hospitalization.

TI  - Effects of elemental diet (ED) on surgical treatment in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 390-2
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with Crohn's disease are at risk of developing short
      bowel syndrome if they are treated with repeated operations. We examined the
      effect of preoperative nutritional therapy with elemental diet on the interval
      until and the outcome after surgical treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. 
      METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the records for 73 patients with Crohn's disease who
      underwent intestinal resection in our department between January 1, 1974 and
      December 31, 1996. Thirty-two of them had not received elemental diet (No ED
      group) and 41 had received elemental diet therapy (ED group) before the first
      resection. RESULTS: The median interval between the onset and first resection was
      19.3 months for the NoED group and 67.5 months for the ED group (P = 0.0005). All
      patients received ED therapy after the first resection. The incidence of second
      resection was significantly different between the ED and the NoED group after the
      first operation. (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet therapy is effective in
      prolonging the interval between the onset and first resection and in reducing the
      incidence of second resection. The initial introduction of elemental diet therapy
      is useful in the management of the clinical course of Crohn's disease minimizing 
      surgical intervention.

TI  - Efficacy of oral adsorbent for treatment of peristomal fistula associated with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 296-8
AB  - Perianal fistulae are frequently seen complications in Crohn's disease. Although 
      surgical procedures such as Seton's method have been devised, many patients still
      suffer from fistulae that are resistant to conventional therapy. We administered 
      oral adsorbent to a patient with disease Crohn's who had a complicated peristomal
      fistula that did not improve with conventional therapy. Six grams of oral
      adsorbent (AST-120) were added daily to a regimen of elemental diet therapy and
      prednisolone. The fistula gradually decreased in size after the administration of
      the oral adsorbent, and had healed completely after 40 days' treatment. There
      were no side effects from the oral adsorbent. This case report suggests that oral
      adsorbent is an effective treatment for peristomal fistula associated with
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Outcome of ileal pouch after secondary diagnosis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 49-53
AB  - Ileal-pouch anal anastomosis is sometimes performed inappropriately in Crohn's
      disease patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term results in this
      subset. In 54 ileal-pouch anal anastomoses performed between 1985 and 1997 for
      CUD the patient was eventually diagnosed as having Crohn's disease in seven
      cases. A retrospective review was performed. Definitive diagnosis was established
      on histopathology, endoscopy, and clinical presentation. The principal outcome
      factors were pouch failure, reason for failure, and functional results in cases
      of retained pouch. Patients ranked their quality of life between 1 and 10. We
      found three failures due to pelvic abscess, anoperineal disease, and anovulvar
      fistula. The pouch was excised in the latter patient; four patients retained
      their pouch. Functional results were good in the four (7 year follow-up): 7.25
      bowel movements per day, ability to discriminate flatus from feces in three,
      soiling in one, urgency in one, perianal pad in one, ability to differ bowel
      movement for 66 min, diet, and antidiarrheal medication all four, pouchitis in
      one, sexual troubles in one woman, no urinary or obstetric trouble. Quality of
      life was judged satisfactory by six of the seven patients. Our 13% rate of
      inadvertent ileal-pouch anal anastomosis is higher than results usually reported.
      This difference is explained by the diagnostic criteria, whose validity is
      controversial. Three-stage surgery to decrease inadvertent restorative
      coloproctectomy is worth considering. Even if results are good when the pouch is 
      functioning, Crohn's disease remains a contraindication to ileal-pouch anal
      anastomosis because of its high rate of failure and excision.

TI  - Comparison of laparoscopically assisted and conventional ileocolic resection for 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare safety, outcome, and feasibility of laparoscopic assisted
      and conventional laparotomy for ileocolic resection in Crohn's disease. DESIGN:
      Retrospective study. SETTING: Private clinic, USA. SUBJECTS: 74 patients who had 
      ileocolic resection and anastomosis for Crohn's disease between August 1991 and
      July 1996, 48 through conventional laparotomy and 26 in whom it was
      laparoscopically assisted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, operating time, duration
      of hospital stay, early and late morbidity, and patients' subjective assessment. 
      RESULTS: The mean age was 42 (+/- 17) in the conventional group and 40 (+/- 15)
      in the laparoscopically assisted group. The mean operating time was significantly
      shorter in the conventional group, 90.5 +/- 3.7 minutes, compared with 150 +/-
      1.2 minutes in the laparoscopic-assisted group (p < 0.0001), but they stayed in
      hospital significantly longer, 9.6 +/- 0.6 days in the conventional group,
      compared with 7 +/- 0.8 days in the laparoscopic-assisted group (p < 0.0001).
      There were no differences between the groups in the incidence of early
      complications or the cost of admission, but at a mean follow up of 30 months
      (range 2-59) significantly more patients in the conventional group had developed 
      symptomatic bowel obstruction (15/48 compared with 2/26, p = 0.02). 31 patients
      in the conventional group (65%) and 16 in the laparoscopically assisted group
      (62%) returned their subjective assessments. There were no differences between
      the groups in the number with changed bowel habits, use of drugs for bowel
      movement, or restricted diet, but patients in the laparoscopically assisted group
      returned to work more quickly (3.7 +/- 1.2 weeks) compared with 8.2 +/- 1.1 weeks
      in the conventional group, had better cosmetic results (14/16 compared with
      13/31, p = 0.004), and were more likely to have improved social and sexual lives 
      (8/16 compared with 5/31, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopically assisted
      ileocolic resection for Crohn' s disease is safe and has less morbidity than
      conventional laparotomy.

TI  - Mucosal healing and a fall in mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA induced by a
      specific oral polymeric diet in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 281-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition is a recognized form of treatment for
      intestinal Crohn's disease, there are persisting problems with feed palatability 
      and only limited data as to its mode of action. AIM: To assess the effects of a
      specific oral polymeric diet (CT3211; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland), which is rich 
      in transforming growth factor beta2, on the mucosal inflammatory process.
      METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive children with active intestinal Crohn's disease 
      were treated with CT3211 as the sole source of nutrition for 8 weeks. Patients
      were assessed clinically, and endoscopically, whilst cytokine mRNA was measured
      in mucosal biopsies before and after treatment by quantitative reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 8 weeks 79% of children
      were in complete clinical remission. Macroscopic and histological healing in the 
      terminal ileum and colon was associated with a decline in ileal and colonic
      interleukin-1beta mRNA (pre-treatment to post-treatment ratio 0.008 and 0.06: P <
      0.001, P = 0.006). In the ileum there was also a fall in interferon gamma mRNA
      (ratio 0.15, P < 0.001) with a rise in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA
      (ratio 10, P = 0.04), whilst in the colon interleukin-8 mRNA fell with treatment 
      (ratio 0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to oral polymeric diet
      CT3211 is associated with mucosal healing and a down regulation of mucosal
      pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in both the terminal ileum and colon. In the ileum
      there was also an increase in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA.

TI  - Polymeric versus elemental diet as primary treatment in active Crohn's disease: a
      randomized, double-blind trial.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active
      Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare
      the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED).
      METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index
      [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal
      C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The
      two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino
      acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered
      successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or 
      = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a 
      normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized
      to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission
      was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients
      receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD
      and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed
      (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19)
      was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in
      the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6),
      respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's
      disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to
      their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally
      effective.

TI  - The long-term results of resection and multiple resections in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 41-51
AB  - Crohn's disease is a panenteric, transmural inflammatory disease of unknown
      origin. Although primarily managed medically, 70% to 90% of patients will require
      surgical intervention. Surgery for small bowel Crohn's is usually necessary for
      unrelenting stenotic complications of the disease. Fistula, abscess, and
      perforation can also necessitate surgical intervention. Most patients benefit
      from resection or strictureplasty with an improved quality of life and remission 
      of disease, but recurrence is common and 33% to 82% of patients will need a
      second operation, and 22% to 33% will require more than two resections.
      Short-bowel syndrome is unavoidable in a small percentage of Crohn's patients
      because of recurrent resection of affected small bowel and inflammatory
      destruction of the remaining mucosa. Although previously a lethal and unrelenting
      disease with death caused by malnutrition, patients with short-bowel syndrome
      today can lead productive lives with maintenance on total parenteral nutrition
      (TPN). This lifestyle, however, does not come without a price. Severe TPN-related
      complications, such as sepsis of indwelling central venous catheters and liver
      failure, do occur. Future developments will focus on more powerful and effective 
      anti-inflammatory medication specifically targeting the immune mechanisms
      responsible for Crohn's disease. Successful medical management of the disease
      will alleviate the need for surgical resection and reduce the frequency of
      short-bowel syndrome. Improving the efficacy of immunosuppression and the
      understanding of tolerance induction should increase the safety and applicability
      of small-bowel transplant for those with short gut. Tissue engineering offers the
      potential to avoid immunosuppression altogether and supplement intestinal length 
      using the patient's own tissues.

TI  - Energy metabolism and substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 173-8
AB  - Weight loss and malnutrition are common features in patients with Crohn's
      disease. This study was designed to evaluate diet-induced thermogenesis and
      substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease. Twenty-three patients (17
      women, 6 men; age 34 +/- 2 y) and 17 healthy control subjects (13 women, 4 men;
      age 36 +/- 3 y) were studied. Resting energy expenditure and fasting substrate
      oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after an overnight
      fast. After a standard homogenized test meal (10 kcal/kg), indirect calorimetry
      was performed every 30 min for 3 h to measure the diet-induced thermogenesis and 
      the postprandial substrate oxidation. In the fasting state, resting energy
      expenditure was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (1433
      +/- 43 versus 1279 +/- 53 kcal/24 h). Lipid oxidation was higher in patients with
      Crohn's disease than in control subjects (1.17 +/- 0. 07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.11 mg.
      kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). Postprandially, diet-induced thermogenesis was
      significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects
      (4.6% +/- 0.5 versus 6.3% +/- 0.5 of energy intake, P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation
      was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control
      subjects (0.78 +/- 0.05 versus 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05), and 
      glucose oxidation was lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control
      subjects. In patients with Crohn's disease, lipid oxidation positively correlates
      with the disease activity evaluated by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r =
      0.48, P150), fasting and postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly higher
      than in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (P < 0.05). In conclusion,
      patients with Crohn's disease have increased fat oxidation, which correlates with
      disease activity and this may explain the reduced fat stores in patients with
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Clinical importance of n-3 fatty acid-rich diet and nutritional education for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 99-104
AB  - Elemental diet (ED) therapy has been established as primary therapy for Crohn's
      disease, and home enteral nutrition (HEN) has been reported to control relapse at
      a dose of more than 30kcal/kg of ideal body weight. However, a decrease in ED
      compliance with long-term use is becoming problem. We developed an n-3 fatty
      acid-rich diet and carried out nutritional education specifically for Crohn's
      disease patients using HEN to facilitate compliance and to improve their
      nutritional status. After the introduction of this n-3 rich diet, disease
      activity was not altered, and nutritional status, especially serum n-3 fatty acid
      levels, improved. The remission periods in patients with poor compliance seemed
      to be prolonged by the nutritional education. Thus, a n-3 rich diet in
      combination with nutritional education specific for Crohn's disease patients is
      very important for the in maintenance of high compliance and for maintaining
      nutritional balance.

TI  - Effect of a vegetable-protein-rich polymeric diet treatment on body composition
      and energy metabolism in inactive Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since malnutrition and lactose intolerance are frequently reported in 
      Crohn's disease (CD), we evaluated the differences in terms of
      compliance-to-treatment and nutritional status in inactive CD patients after two 
      different treatments using either a standard polymeric diet or a
      vegetable-protein-rich and lactose-free diet. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study.
      SUBJECTS: Forty CD patients with inactive disease were randomly divided into two 
      groups. Group A (10 men; aged 33.9+/-7.2 years; BMI, 21.8+/-1.7 kg/m2) received a
      conventional polymeric enteral diet, while group B (10 men; aged 35.6+/-6.8
      years; BMI, 21.4+/-1.8 kg/m2) was administered a soy-rich and lactose-free
      polymeric diet, over a 4-week period. METHODS: All the patients had a clinical
      and laboratory examination. Body composition was assessed by isotopic dilution
      and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates were measured by 
      indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight significantly increased after
      treatment in both groups (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01), as well as fat-free mass (A,
      P<0.05; and B, P<0.05) and fat mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01). RMR slightly
      increased, although it did not reach statistical significance. Treatment did not 
      influence substrate oxidation rates. Group B lactose-intolerant patients reported
      a greater compliance-to-treatment than those in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      showed that a polymeric enteral diet rich in vegetable protein and not containing
      milk protein, eaten at home, with no need for positioning a nasogastric tube,
      significantly improved body composition in inactive and lactose-intolerant CD
      patients, with no effect on energy metabolism, suggesting that it could be useful
      in improving nutritional status in these patients.

TI  - Bioactive molecules in milk and their role in health and disease: the role of
      transforming growth factor-beta.
PG  - 74-9
AB  - Human breast milk is rich in nutrients, hormones, growth factors and immunoactive
      molecules, which influence the growth, development and immune status of the
      newborn infant. Although several of these factors are also present in bovine
      milk, the greater susceptibility of the formula-fed infant to infection and
      disease and the development of allergy is often attributed to the reduced level
      of protective factors in milk formulas. Nevertheless, modifying manufacturing
      processes may preserve the biological activity of some bioactive molecules in end
      products. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is one such molecule. TGF-beta is
      a polypeptide, which has been described in both human and bovine milk. It is
      implicated in many processes, including epithelial cell growth and
      differentiation, development, carcinogenesis and immune regulation. The present
      article discusses the biological activity of TGF-beta2 that has been preserved
      and activated in a cow's milk-based product. More specifically, it addresses
      possible mechanisms of action in the intestinal lumen and speculates on how milk 
      products containing naturally occurring TGF-beta2 could be exploited in
      functional foods for the infant or as therapies for specific intestinal diseases.

TI  - [Toxic megacolon presenting as Crohn's disease].
PG  - 580-2
AB  - We introduce a young patient, without history of inflammatory bowel disease
      (I.B.D.) who started with an acute gastroenteritis, which in the following days
      progressed to a toxic megacolon. The patient had come to hospital with nausea,
      vomiting, fever and liquid, explosive diarrhoea without pathologic products.
      There was no clinical remission with astringent diet, hydroelectrolitic
      reposition and antidiarrheic opiates. The patient was admitted in hospital when
      he had blood in the diarrhoea. This progressed to a toxic megacolon in three days
      and the patient had to be operated on urgently. The surgeons found perforations
      in the colon and the pathologists diagnosed Crohn disease. Even without previous 
      E.B.D. history we reached the diagnosis from the clinical and analytical data and
      the plain abdominal radiology. It was impossible to confirm the diagnosis with a 
      colonoscopy because of the high risk of perforation. In cases like this, early
      surgery may save the life of the patient.

TI  - Double-blind randomized controlled trial of glutamine-enriched polymeric diet in 
      the treatment of active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 78-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutamine is traditionally considered a nonessential amino acid but
      may be conditionally essential in patients with catabolic conditions.
      Glutamine-supplemented foods in these patients have been shown to prevent
      deterioration of gut permeability, protect against the development of intestinal 
      mucosal atrophy, and improve nitrogen balance. Animal models of inflammatory
      bowel disease suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral diets may lead to less
      severe intestinal damage, less weight loss, improved nitrogen balance, and
      reduced disease activity. The purpose of the current study was to compare the
      efficacy of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet with a standard low-glutamine
      polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eighteen
      children with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week
      course of either a standard polymeric diet with a low glutamine content (4% of
      amino acid composition; group S) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% of
      amino acid composition; Group G). The two diets were isocaloric and
      isonitrogenous with an identical essential amino acid profile. Remission rates
      were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Changes in clinical and laboratory
      parameters of disease activity were also compared after 4 weeks of nutritional
      treatment. RESULTS: Two of the children, both in group G, were withdrawn from the
      trial because of nontolerance of the diet. There was no difference between the
      two groups in proportion of patients achieving remission (intent-to-treat basis):
      5 (55.5%) of 9 in group S versus 4 (44.4%) of 9 in group G (p = 0.5). Improvement
      in mean paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) was significantly more 
      in group S (p = 0.002) but changes in orosomucoid level, platelet count, and
      weight were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest
      that a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet offers no advantage over a standard
      low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Rather, 
      it appears to be less effective in improving PCDAI. The reported beneficial
      effects of glutamine seen in many catabolic states must be viewed with caution
      when extrapolating to the management of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 339S-42S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/71.1.339s [doi]
AB  - The rationale for supplementation with n-3 fatty acids to promote the health of
      the gastrointestinal tract lies in the antiinflammatory effects of these lipid
      compounds. The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the
      low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was
      to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory
      bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are
      controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different
      study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some 
      of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation
      that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and
      paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating
      further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Dietetic treatment of Crohn's disease has the objective to calm down the gut
      either by a polymeric or elemental diet. In superacute conditions also total
      parenteral nutrition can be used. In the quiescent stage the patient must have an
      adequate energy intake and a low-residue (low-fibre) diet. As to medication,
      sulfasalazine which has some side-effects is abandoned and 5-ASA
      (5-aminosalicylic acid) preparations are used, either by the oral route or in
      enemas, while 4-ASA is little used in this country and is known as PAS. The
      administration of corticoids which also have side-effects will be abandoned in
      favour of so-called rapidly metabolized corticoids (Tixocortol pivalate,
      beclomethasone, budenoside and fluticasone) by the oral route and in enemas and
      foams. As antimicrobial treatment ciprofloxacine is used combined with
      metronidazole. As to immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
      cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are tested. A hope for the
      future is so-called biological treatment (anticytokines, monoclonal antibodies
      against cytokines, against CD4+ TNF, interleukines IL-10 and 11, immunoglobulin; 
      plasmapheresis is also tested). Treatment must be individual and surgery as late 
      as possible, only in case of complications, and should be very sparing, stenoses 
      should be treated by plastic operations of strictures.

TI  - The relation between antioxidant status and alterations in fatty acid profile in 
      patients with Crohn disease and controls.
PG  - 1108-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: A diminished antioxidant defence and alterations in the fatty acid
      profile may play a role in the pathophysiology of inflammation in Crohn disease
      (CD). METHODS: Antioxidant status (serum antioxidant vitamins and minerals,
      glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activity), disease activity,
      dietary intake, and the fatty acid profile in plasma and erythrocyte
      phospholipids were studied in patients with active CD (n = 12), inactive CD (n = 
      50), and controls (n = 70). Eight patients with active CD were re-evaluated
      during the subsequent phase of clinical remission. The relation between the
      variables was assessed by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: We observed a
      significantly diminished antioxidant status in patients with active CD compared
      with inactive CD and controls. Furthermore, the antioxidant defence was depleted 
      in patients with inactive CD compared with controls. An aberrant fatty acid
      profile in plasma phospholipids was found in active and inactive CD compared with
      controls. Multivariate analysis showed that the plasma phospholipid fatty acid
      indices were significantly associated with several antioxidants (beta-carotene,
      vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase) in CD patients but not in controls.
      CONCLUSION: The fatty acid profile in CD patients is significantly associated
      with disease activity and serum antioxidant concentrations. This observation,
      along with the diminished antioxidant defence in patients with active and
      inactive CD, indicates that antioxidants should be considered in the therapy of
      inflammation in CD.

PG  - 71S-80S
AB  - Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and
      trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
      and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In
      general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any
      restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and
      the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the
      nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use
      of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice
      nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at
      least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a
      specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been
      suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the
      activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in 
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in 
      maintaining the remission of the disease.

TI  - Mesenteric blood flow is related to disease activity and risk of relapse in
      Crohn's disease: a prospective follow-up study.
PG  - 2942-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The diagnostic significance of increased splanchnic blood flow in
      Crohn's disease is unclear. This prospective study was therefore undertaken to
      define the role of Doppler sonography in the assessment of disease activity and
      in the prediction of early relapse. METHODS: Splanchnic flowmetry was performed
      in 59 patients with Crohn's disease and 20 healthy volunteers during fasting and 
      30 min after ingestion of a standardized meal. Twenty-one patients measured
      during the active state and in clinical remission were followed-up for 6 months. 
      Hemodynamic parameters of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and the
      portal vein were related to clinical (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI]),
      laboratory (C-reactive protein), and endoscopic (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index
      of Severity) parameters of disease activity. RESULTS: The postprandial mean
      velocity of the superior mesenteric artery correlated closest with clinical
      activity (CDAI, p < 0.005) and C-reactive protein (p < 0.01), but was unrelated
      to endoscopic activity. All patients in remission after 6 months (9/9) showed an 
      increase in postprandial pulsatility index of the superior mesenteric artery,
      compared with an initial measurement during active disease (+28%). In contrast,
      the majority of patients with later relapse or surgery (11/12) had decreased
      pulsatility index during initial remission (-20%). The positive predictive value 
      of this index for maintenance of remission was 0.82. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial
      flow measurements in the superior mesenteric artery are closely related to
      clinical but not endoscopic disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.
      The repeated measurement of the postprandial pulsatility index allows estimation 
      of the risk of recurrence.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in the management of patients with acute
      attacks of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the prolonged duration of
      total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      parameters and short-term outcome in acute attacks of ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's colitis, and the difference in the response to TPN between the two
      diseases. Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative
      colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were
      analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were
      treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were 
      treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both
      groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical
      characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks
      were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the
      clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between
      the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations
      were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). 
      The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter,
      inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with
      ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy
      rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast,
      TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both
      the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12
      patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional
      benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In
      contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.

TI  - Management of urinary complications in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 713-7
AB  - Among the 127 patients who underwent surgical treatment for Crohn's disease at
      Tohoku University Hospital, urinary complications were noted in 13 patients
      (10.2%), including urolithiasis in 6 patients (4.7%), a ureteral obstruction in 4
      (3.1%), and urinary fistula in 3 (2.4%). In patients with urolithiasis,
      conservative therapy was effective. An ureteral obstruction was detected on the
      right side in all 4 of these cases because of the inflamed terminal ileum. In 2
      of the 4 cases, the symptoms improved by either preoperative total parenteral
      nutrition or elemental diet therapy. A resection of the inflamed intestine was
      necessary in all cases. In patients with urinary fistulas, a resection of the
      inflamed intestine combined with a reconstruction of the urinary tract was
      carried out after total parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, conservative therapy
      with preoperative total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet therapy proved to 
      be effective for a ureteral obstruction since it improved the intestinal
      inflammation. As a definitive treatment, surgery is still necessary for the
      management of urinary fistulas and ureteral obstruction. Based on our findings,
      patients with urolithiasis in Crohn's disease should thus be treated
      conservatively in the same way as patients without Crohn's disease.

TI  - Essential fatty acids in health and chronic disease.
PG  - 560S-569S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s [doi]
AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3
      and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous
      increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of
      vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and
      soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges
      from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies
      indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to
      one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood
      viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3
      Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic,
      hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty
      acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils
      [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However,
      alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and
      walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself
      may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.

TI  - Effect of sequential erythromycin and octreotide on antroduodenal manometry.
PG  - 293-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In earlier studies, erythromycin stimulated but octreotide inhibited 
      gastric antral contractions, as each drug induced phase 3-like episodes. METHODS:
      To assess the effect of erythromycin pretreatment on octreotide-induced changes
      in antroduodenal motility, 16 patients were studied (mean age, 8.7 +/- 1.5 years,
      8 male): 6 with severe gastroesophageal reflux, 4 with cyclic vomiting, 3 with
      gastroparesis, 2 with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and 1 with Crohn's
      disease and unexplained nausea and vomiting. After recording fasting
      antroduodenal motility for 3 hours, 1 mg/kg intravenous erythromycin was
      administered over 30 minutes. Sixty minutes after the erythromycin infusion, 0.5 
      microg/kg subcutaneous octreotide was administered, followed 1 hour later by a
      meal. RESULTS: Phase 3 occurred spontaneously in 10 patients and after
      erythromycin in 12 patients. When administered after erythromycin, octreotide
      immediately induced phase 3s contractions in 15 patients, beginning in the
      antrum. In 7 children, some of the octreotide-induced phase 3s did not propagate.
      After the meal, antral contractions continued in all patients. The fed pattern
      was replaced in 14 patients by alternating phase 3 and phase 1 activities.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with erythromycin prevented octreotide-induced
      inhibition of antral contractions. Inhibition of antral contractions by
      octreotide may be mediated through either a direct or indirect suppression of
      motilin release, because antral contractions persist after pretreatment with the 
      motilin receptor agonist erythromycin.

TI  - The relationship between habits of food consumption and reported reactions to
      food in people with inflammatory bowel disease--testing the limits.
PG  - 69-83
AB  - Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods 
      make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports
      about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with 
      IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD 
      disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the
      subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked
      simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's
      disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two
      seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit
      of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect 
      people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods
      that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that
      affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings
      included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with
      Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with 
      chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both
      groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals
      with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption 
      since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may 
      be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill
      population.

TI  - A case of Crohn's disease with recurrent massive life-threatening hemorrhage from
      terminal ileum.
PG  - 1695-8
AB  - A case of Crohn's disease that underwent bowel resection two times at 3-year
      intervals due to life-threatening hemorrhage from ileum is presented. The
      bleeding sites were located in the ulcer lesions of ileum, in the oral side near 
      to the ileum-colon transition. The first bleeding point was at the longitudinal
      ulcer of the terminal ileum and the secondary bleeding site was at the profound
      ulcer of ileum appearing in the oral side near to the ileo-colic anastomosis.
      This is the first case of Crohn's disease with recurrent life-threatening massive
      hemorrhage in the terminal region of ileum, for which operative bowel resections 
      were necessary. This case suggests that we should search for the bleeding site in
      ileal lesions developed in the circumference of and especially the oral side near
      to the anastomosis due to prior resection, when intestinal massive bleeding
      occurs again after bowel resection, and that the careful follow-up and strict
      treatment with diet therapy and/or anti-inflammatory drugs are necessary for the 
      protection of recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Nutrition and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 423-43, ix
AB  - This article reviews the nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      including the mechanisms and manifestations of malnutrition and the efficacy of
      nutritional therapies. Nutrient deficiencies in patients with IBD occur via
      several mechanisms and may complicate the course of the disease. Nutritional
      status is assessed by clinical examination and the use of nutritional indices
      such as the Subjective Global Assessment of nutritional status. Nutritional
      intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the 
      costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted,
      especially in patients presumed to need parenteral nutrition.

AB  - CD and UC represent a spectrum of chronic IBD that present in protean ways and
      are accompanied by a variety of systemic sequelae. Sulfasalazine and the newer
      5-aminosalicylates are important in the management of mild-to-moderate disease,
      whereas corticosteroids remain the primary therapy for most patients with
      moderate-to-severe disease (Tables 2-5). The toxicities associated with long-term
      steroid therapy, combined with their ineffectiveness as maintenance medications, 
      have led to increased use of immunomodulators, such as azathioprine and 6-MP, for
      the treatment of steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant IBD. Infliximab is a
      novel therapeutic adjunct for chronically active and fistulizing CD that will
      herald a new era of biologic therapy for IBD. Meanwhile, CSA remains an
      alternative to urgent colectomy in severe UC unresponsive to corticosteroids and 
      also for CD patients with severe disease or refractory fistulas. Finally,
      continued insights into the etiopathogenic pathways in IBD will provide evolving 
      and innovative approaches until the eventual causes and cures are elucidated. In 
      the meantime, clinicians should remain optimistic regarding current ability to
      reduce the morbidity and maintain the quality of life for patients suffering with
      these frustrating diseases.

TI  - Laparoscopically assisted intestinal resection in 88 patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 595-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experience with 94 resections in 88 patients with Crohn's disease
      using advanced laparoscopic techniques is reported. Records of patients who
      underwent intestinal resection for Crohn's disease between August, 1993 and
      November, 1998 were reviewed. Indications, operative findings, clinicopathologic,
      and postoperative data were recorded. METHODS: In this study, the mean age was 37
      years (range, 16-70 years), and 55% of the participants were women. Indications
      for surgery included obstruction (64 cases), pain (22 cases), peritonitis (1
      case) and abscess (1 case). Seventy patients underwent ileocolic resection, 28 of
      whom had a previous history of one or two ileocolic resections. Eight of these
      patients had additional procedures including tubal ligation (1), sigmoidectomy
      (1), cholecystectomy (3 cases), and enterectomy (3 cases). Small bowel resection 
      (13 cases), right hemicolectomy (3 cases), subtotal colectomy (3 cases), anterior
      rectal resection (2 cases), and sigmoid resection (3 cases) were performed in the
      remaining patients. All but one procedure were completed laparoscopically with
      extracorporeal anastomosis. The average length of intestine resected was 33 cm
      (range, 10-92 cm). Forty-one patients had 58 fistulae between ileum, jejunum,
      mesentery, colon, abdominal wall, skin, or bladder. Mean blood loss was 168 ml
      (range, 30-800 ml) and mean operative time was 183 min (range, 96-400 min).
      RESULTS: More than 85% of the patients were tolerating a liquid diet on the first
      postoperative day. Average length of hospital stay was 4.2 days (range, 3-11
      days). Complications included anastomotic leak necessitating reoperation,
      stricture requiring endoscopic dilation, hemorrhage treated expectantly, urinary 
      tract infection, pulmonary embolus, line sepsis, and early postoperative
      intestinal obstruction (7 cases) requiring reoperation in three cases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Experience with both advanced laparoscopic techniques and
      conventional surgery for inflammatory bowel disease allowed successful
      laparoscopic management of patients with complicated Crohn's disease.

TI  - Quality of life in children with Crohn's disease: a pilot study.
PG  - S37-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Focus group meetings were held with two groups, each containing 12
      children with Crohn's disease aged 8 to 12 and 12 to 17 years. The children were 
      asked broad questions about how Crohn's disease and its treatment affected their 
      lives. To explore these areas in more detail, an 88-item questionnaire was
      developed and read to an additional 16 of 20 children with Crohn's disease
      selected at random from outpatients. At first, many of the children denied that
      Crohn's disease affected their lives at all, but it soon became apparent that
      many were frustrated or angry about physical symptoms, lack of understanding
      about Crohn's disease, unpleasant investigations, treatment, and hospitalisation.
      METHODS: The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life 
      including symptoms and treatment, social, emotional, family, educational, and
      future aspects. RESULTS: Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although
      surgery was more effective in controlling symptoms. Children receiving steroids
      had more depressive symptoms. Absenteeism from school and inability to engage in 
      school sports, swimming, and running were frequent problems. There were also
      difficulties with taking holidays and staying at friends' houses. Worry was
      reported in 14 of 16 children, anger and frustration and feeling fed up in 12 of 
      16. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition,
      Crohn's disease has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of
      affected children. Future studies of treatment in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease should include an attempt to assess the impact on the child's
      health-related quality of life.

TI  - Growth in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 89-92
AB  - Abnormal linear growth is frequent in children and adolescents with Crohn's
      disease. The typical pattern is of growth retardation associated with delayed
      skeletal maturation. Puberty is also frequently delayed. Over 50% of patients may
      have a subnormal height velocity, and approximately 25% will have short stature. 
      The endocrine status is characterized by normal growth hormone secretion and a
      slightly subnormal serum level of insulin-like growth factor I, which is related 
      to nutritional status. Principal therapeutic options are intestinal resection for
      localized disease, and enteral nutrition--using a polymeric diet--for more
      widespread disease, particularly involving the small intestine. Growth responses 
      to both modalities are often excellent and produce considerable psychological
      benefit. Optimum therapy is achieved by close collaboration between
      gastroenterologists and endocrinologists, and by the use of auxological methods
      to document pre- and post-therapeutic management.

TI  - Elevated diet-induced thermogenesis and lipid oxidation rate in Crohn disease.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although malnutrition is frequently observed in Crohn disease (CD),
      its cause is not clear. Regulation of energy metabolism and diet-induced
      thermogenesis (DIT) have not been adequately studied in CD. OBJECTIVE: The aim
      was to study DIT and substrate oxidation in patients with inactive ileal CD.
      DESIGN: After a test meal providing 50.2 kJ/kg body wt, DIT was assessed by
      indirect calorimetry performed over 360 min in 18 CD patients and 12 healthy
      volunteers matched for age, sex, weight, and height. Body composition was
      evaluated with the labeled-water-bolus injection technique. RESULTS: Fat-free
      mass did not differ significantly between groups, but CD patients had markedly
      lower fat mass than control subjects (13.8+/-5.63 compared with 19.0+/-3.49 kg; P
      < 0.001). Nonprotein respiratory quotient was lower in CD patients than control
      subjects (0.80+/-0.04 compared with 0.86+/-0.03; P < 0.001). Average respiratory 
      quotient between 75 and 150 min after the test meal was 0.85+/-0.03 in CD
      patients and 0.91+/-0.02 in control subjects (P < 0.001). Lipid oxidation rate
      was higher in CD patients than in control subjects (2.26+/-1.13 compared with
      1.50+/-0.75 kJ/min; P < 0.05). DIT was higher in CD patients than in control
      subjects (9.89+/-1.93% compared with 5.67+/-0.91% of energy intake; P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inactive ileal CD had significantly higher DIT and
      lipid oxidation rate than do healthy volunteers. These results may explain why CD
      patients have difficulty maintaining adequate nutritional status, and the
      findings also suggest that a diet relatively rich in fat may attain better energy
      balance.

TI  - Increased concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein in whole-gut lavage
      fluid from children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eosinophils may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in
      inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to verify whether
      concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein in gut lavage fluid from children
      with inflammatory bowel disease correlate with clinical and laboratory indexes of
      disease activity. METHODS: Twenty-three children with Crohn's disease, 14 with
      ulcerative colitis, and 22 age-matched control subjects entered the study.
      Radioimmunoassay and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were
      used to measure eosinophilic cationic protein, total immunoglobulin G and
      interleukin-1beta, respectively. RESULTS: Gut lavage eosinophilic cationic
      protein levels were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in patients with Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis than in control subjects. Intestinal eosinophilic 
      cationic protein levels decreased in three of four children with Crohn's disease 
      who were fed an elemental diet. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation
      between eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations and immunoglobulin G and
      interleukin-1beta levels in gut lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intestinal
      eosinophilic cationic protein levels in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that
      eosinophils are involved in the gastrointestinal inflammation in this disease.
      Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein concentration is another marker with
      which to discriminate between active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease.
