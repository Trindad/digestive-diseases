TI  - Use of the Parental Bonding Instrument to compare interpretations of the parental
      bond by adolescent girls with restricting and binge/purging anorexia nervosa.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) was administered to 62 adolescent female
      patients (mean age 14.3): 35 with restricting-type anorexia nervosa (RAN), and 27
      with binge/purging-type anorexia nervosa (B/PAN) according to the DSM-IV
      criteria, all at onset and initial diagnosis. The PBI was also administered to a 
      control group (55 subjects) and 22 patients with Crohn's disease or celiac
      disease. The three groups were matched for age and socioeconomic status. The RAN 
      and B/PAN patients gave significantly different interpretations of the parental
      bond (PB): for the former, it was adequate with both parents, for the latter it
      was inadequate, especially with the father. The fact that these differences exist
      at the onset of anorexia prior to any possible effect of therapy suggests that
      its structure is determined by different family dynamics.

TI  - Modulation of intestinal immune system by dietary fat intake: relevance to
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1183-90
AB  - Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the major inductive site of the mucosal immune 
      system, which is functionally independent of the systemic immune system. Both the
      amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of
      long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in
      intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty acid absorption also significantly
      enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to
      up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin.
      Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both
      receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids
      at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via 
      eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular 
      signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the
      intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells
      follows long-chain fatty acid absorption. In Crohn's disease, elemental diets and
      total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic
      load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating
      hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary oleic acid supplements caused an immunological
      reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet.
      An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate
      its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's disease. In
      contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of
      Crohn's disease. Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with
      immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary 
      fat can be important in management of this disease.

TI  - [Enteral nutrition in acute Crohn disease].
PG  - 983-95
AB  - High-dose corticosteroids remain the gold standard of therapy in acute Crohn's
      disease, but is associated with a variety of side effects. Nutritional therapy
      could be an interesting alternative, but corticosteroids are meant to be
      significantly superior according to efficacy. Published studies, identified by
      references, MEDLINE and meta-analysis, were evaluated for efficacy of nutritional
      therapy in acute Crohn's disease. In 18 evaluable of 38 identified publications, 
      571 patients were treated with nutritional therapy: 295 received elemental diet, 
      214 oligopeptide diet and 62 polymeric diet. Remission rates were 60%, 55% and
      66% respectively. However, only intention-to-treat-analysis was performed in all 
      the studies. When correcting for patients who really were treated with
      nutritional therapy, remission rates were substantially better: 73%, 70% and 67% 
      respectively, thus comparable with that of corticosteroids. Positive predictors
      for successful treatment were stenosing disease and low ESR. Remission seems to
      last as long as after corticosteroid treatment, when a reinduction diet is
      performed. Negative aspects of nutritional therapy are poor tolerance and higher 
      costs. Perspectives for the future aim on broadening of indications, improving
      acceptance (by adjuvant instead of exclusive nutrition, or new flavors) and
      efficacy by modification of compounds (such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids or 
      trace elements) or combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., mesalamine).

AB  - We describe a young Japanese woman who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease
      affecting the ileum, transverse colon, and rectum, as confirmed by barium
      studies, colonoscopy, and histopathological examination. Her father and sister
      also had Crohn's disease. After a 4-yr course of sulfasalazine and elemental diet
      therapy, she was readmitted for perianal abscess associated with the presence of 
      pancytopenia, microhematuria with granular cast, hypocomplementemia, and high
      titers of autoimmune antibodies (anti-ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies). Based on
      these features, a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was made.
      Despite the rarity of such combination (Crohn's disease with SLE), patients with 
      Crohn's disease who develop such clinical findings might need evaluation for SLE.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2411-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of disease localization
      on the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of inactive Crohn's disease
      (CD). METHODS: Forty-three patients with biopsy or radiology proven CD (23 men;
      age, 33.8 yr; range, 18-54 yr) in clinical remission (simplified Crohn's diseases
      activity index [SCDAI] < 3) and not receiving steroid therapy or nutritional
      support were enrolled in the study. Patients were separated into three subgroups 
      according to disease localization: ileal (n = 16), ileo-colonic (n = 13), and
      colonic CD (n = 14). Sixty healthy volunteers (26 men; age, 32.0 yr; range, 18-60
      yr), matched for age and height were used as control subjects. Body composition
      was assessed by both anthropometry and bioimpedance analysis and indirect
      calorimetry was performed to measure energy expenditure and substrate oxidation
      rates. RESULTS: CD patients showed a lower body weight than controls, both as a
      whole (61.5 kg; range, 41.5-74.0 vs 66.9 kg; range, 55.0-86.0 kg; p < 0.001) and 
      separated by disease localization (ileal; p < 0.001; ileo-colonic; p < 0.001; and
      colonic; p < 0.05 vs controls). Fat-free mass (FFM) did not differ between the
      groups, whereas fat mass was significantly lower in CD patients than in controls 
      (p < 0.001), with the lowest values in ileal and ileo-colonic patients. Basal
      metabolic rate by kg of FFM was higher in CD patients than in healthy individuals
      (p < 0.01). Nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD than in
      controls as a whole (0.79; range, 0.73-0.84 vs 0.83; range, 0.79-0.89; p < 0.001)
      or separated by disease localization (p < 0.001 each subgroup vs controls), with 
      a consequent higher lipid oxidation rate. A lower dietary lipid intake was found 
      in patients than in controls (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of disease
      localization, CD patients showed a lower fat mass and a higher utilization of
      lipids than control subjects. Patients with ileal and ileo-colonic disease showed
      the greater reduction in body weight, compared with control subjects, suggesting 
      they were at a higher risk of malnutrition, probably as a consequence of the
      simultaneous occurrence of both malabsorption and decreased energy intake.

PG  - 1212-21
AB  - We performed randomized controlled study to compare the short-term therapeutic
      effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), elemental diet (ED) and polymeric
      diet (PD) given as primary therapy in active phase of Crohn's disease. In
      hospital for Crohn's disease, twenty-eight patients were given nutritional
      therapy: 9 patients by TPN, 10 by ED, and 9 by PD. Nutritional state,
      inflammatory reactions, disease activity and clinical remission rate were
      assessed two weeks and four weeks after treatment, and morphological findings
      were assessed before and after each nutritional therapy by radiographic and
      colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory reactions were more effectively controlled by
      TPN and ED than by PD, and early improvement achieved by TPN and ED was
      especially note-worthy. Clinical remission rate after treatment by TPN was
      highest in three types of nutritional approach, but no significant difference was
      seen at any point. In nutritional state, disease activity and morphological
      findings, comparable changes were effected without preference. These results
      suggest that nutritional therapy by total parenteral nutrition and elemental diet
      is superior to polymeric diet for treating active phase of Crohn's disease with
      marked inflammatory reactions.

PG  - 719-23
AB  - We report a case of urolithiasis caused by surgical treatment for Crohn's
      disease. A 28-year-old woman was referred to our department for further
      examination of renal stones from the medical department in September, 1995. She
      suffered from Crohn's disease and had a history of jejuno-ileal resection because
      of perforation of the ileum in 1988. Radiographs revealed multiple bilateral
      renal stones, and the urine oxalate concentration was elevated. She was treated
      with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and the administration of sodium
      bicarbonate and citrate, but these treatments did not prevent recurrence and
      enlargement of stones. Renal function was gradually worsened and we performed
      transurethral lithotomy and percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. The stones were
      mainly composed of oxalate calcium monohydrate. A renal biopsy was performed at
      the operation, showing deposition of crystals in almost all renal tubules. Diet
      therapy (low oxalate and low fat) and the administration of sodium bicarbonate
      and citrate were performed strictly and recurrence was not recognized 10 months
      after complete removal of the stones.

TI  - The influence of a preserved colon on the absorption of medium chain fat in
      patients with small bowel resection.
PG  - 478-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium chain C8-C10 triglycerides (MCTs) improve fat absorption in
      short bowel patients. Effects on overall energy absorption remain unknown. AIMS: 
      To determine whether MCTs and medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are absorbed in
      the colon like the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or are lost in faeces
      similarly to long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). METHODS: Nine small bowel resected
      patients without and 10 with a colon in continuity excreted 2-6 MJ/day and were
      randomised and crossed over between two high fat diets (10 MJ/day, 50% as fat),
      based on either long chain triglycerides (LCT) alone or equal quantities of LCT
      and MCT. RESULTS: Patients with a colon absorbed C8-C10 fatty acids considerably 
      better than patients without a colon at similar and extreme levels of LCFA
      malabsorption; the colonic impact on absorption of C14-18 fatty acids was
      negligible. MCT redoubled fat (MCT+LCT) absorption from 23% to 58% in patients
      with a colon, and increased overall bomb calorimetric energy absorption from 46% 
      to 58%. The increase in fat absorption from 37% to 46% in patients without a
      colon did not improve overall energy absorption because malabsorption of
      carbohydrate and protein increased. CONCLUSION: In small bowel resected patients,
      the colon seems to serve as a digestive organ for medium chain fat, probably
      absorbed as MCFAs, perhaps because like the SCFAs, they are water soluble. Only
      patients with a colon gained from MCT treatment.

TI  - Osteoporosis and determinants of bone density in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2500-6
AB  - Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in patients with Crohn's disease;
      however, the pathogenesis of bone loss and risk factors for osteoporosis are not 
      established. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical, dietary, and nutritional
      determinants of BMD in Crohn's disease. A cross-sectional analysis of 117
      patients with Crohn's disease was undertaken. All patients underwent a clinical
      and dietary evaluation including assessment of nutritional state and life-style. 
      BMD was measured at the hip and lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;
      and z scores obtained by comparison with age- and sex-matched normal values for
      the healthy UK population. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess
      associations between BMD and potential risk factors, allowing for possible
      confounding variables. Thirteen (11%) patients had osteoporosis (z score < -2),
      with osteopenia (z score < -1, > -2) in a further 34 (29%). Patients with jejunal
      disease had significantly lower BMD at the spine (P = 0.03) and femoral neck (P =
      0.02) than those with disease at other sites. Mean BMD was significantly lower at
      the hip of patients with previous bowel resection (diff in means = 0.53, 95% CI
      -0.97, -0.08, P = 0.02), but type of surgery was not significant. Active disease,
      menstrual history, diet, level of physical activity, and smoking were not
      associated with low bone mass. At the lumbar spine, body weight (P < 0.0001),
      male sex (P < 0.0001), and current prednisolone use (P < 0.02) were independently
      predictive of low bone mass. Body weight (P < 0.0001), male sex (P < 0.0001), and
      cumulative steroid dose (P = 0.02) were predictive at the femoral neck. The major
      determinants of BMD in Crohn's disease are body weight, current steroid use, and 
      cumulative steroid dose. Men with Crohn's disease are at greatest risk of
      osteoporosis, with jejunal involvement and previous bowel resection also
      contributing to the low bone mineral density.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 788-91
AB  - Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents
      with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been
      identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
      intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the
      nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which 
      inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth
      and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood
      Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and
      direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent
      studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and
      provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or
      remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is
      efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of
      action is poorly understood.

TI  - Highly destructive perianal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 491-2
AB  - This article reports a case of highly destructive perianal Crohn's disease in a
      15-year-old boy who presented with fecal impaction and incontinence. Both upper
      and lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy were unrevealing. Treatment with
      intravenous prednisolone and broad-spectrum antibiotics supplemented by enteral
      feeding with an elemental diet resulted in prompt recovery. However, healing of
      his perianal lesions began only after a diverting colostomy. Awareness of this
      uncommon entity is important because prompt recognition can lead to early
      institution of appropriate treatment and avoid further morbidity.

AB  - About 90% of patients with Crohn's disease require surgery at some time in their 
      lives but the clinical recurrence rate after surgery is about 50% within 5 years,
      with 50% requiring further surgery within 10 years. Endoscopic evidence of
      relapse can be found in 75% within 12 weeks of resection. There is therefore a
      major problem to be solved. The solution is less clear. Retrospective studies
      suggest that smoking is a major factor determining a poor prognosis after surgery
      and it is most important that patients are encouraged to stop. There is strong
      evidence linking diet with Crohn's disease but the mechanism and nature of this
      link remains unclear. A low total fat intake, possibly supplemented with
      eudragitcoated n-3 fatty acid (fish oil) looks reasonable on current evidence but
      not proven. Mesalazine and metronidazole are the drugs for which most supportive 
      evidence is available. The individual trials of mesalazine have generally proved 
      inconclusive and meta-analyses have been needed to demonstrate a significant
      beneficial effect (approximately halving the relapse rate at 1 year). More recent
      large controlled studies performed after the meta-analyses however have again
      proved negative and the benefit is probably more modest than the meta-analyses
      suggested. Metronidazole, 20 mg/day for the first 3 months after surgery, has
      been shown to reduce relapse by just over one-third with a beneficial effect that
      was surprisingly sustained throughout a 3 year follow-up period. Peripheral
      neuropathy is a problem and further studies are needed at lower dosage.
      Azathioprine, 1.5-2 mg/kg/day is effective as maintenance therapy but there is
      insufficient evidence to recommend its routine post-operative use, moreover it
      takes up to 3 months to have an effect. Although budesonide has been shown to
      delay the time to relapse in non-operated patients it, like other
      corticosteroids, has been shown to be no better than placebo when maintenance is 
      assessed according to the proportion of patients who remain relapse-free after 1 
      year. Patients undergoing operation for Crohn's disease should therefore be
      strongly advised to stop smoking. A 3 month course of oral metronidazole plus
      continued maintenance with oral mesalazine can be justified on current evidence
      but further studies are needed.

TI  - Crohn's disease: nutrition and nutritional therapy.
PG  - 93-114
AB  - Disordered nutrition is common in Crohn's disease and is multifactorial. Regular 
      and systematic monitoring of at least a minimum set of nutrition data is an
      essential component of care of children and adults with Crohn's disease. However,
      even in children, monitoring of growth and development may be deficient. Multiple
      macro- and micronutrient deficiencies are common in Crohn's disease, especially
      in those with extensive small bowel deficiencies or after multiple surgical
      resections. Body composition analysis may show differences from simple
      starvation, and metabolic effects of inflammation are increasingly being
      recognized. Nutritional support is part of the management of all patients with
      Crohn's disease, but nutritional intervention with defined formula liquid diet is
      an effective specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Although meta-analysis of
      published trials suggest that steroids are more effective than defined formula
      liquid diets, objective evidence from whole gut lavage fluid analysis and from
      faecal excretion of radiolabelled leukocytes shows unequivocal benefit of
      elemental diet based on measuring parameters of tissue damage. Enteral feeding
      with liquid diets should be considered in patients with incomplete small bowel
      obstruction, severe painful perianal disease, failure of corticosteroids in
      active Crohn's disease, borderline intestinal failure and in children with active
      Crohn's disease or with growth failure.

TI  - [A case of systemic AA amyloidosis complicating Crohn's disease].
PG  - 284-9
AB  - Although systemic AA amyloidosis complicating Crohn's disease has been found in
      0.5 to 6% in America and Europe, it is relatively rare in Japan. We report a case
      of systemic AA amyloidosis complicating Crohn's disease. In 1979, a 26-year-old
      Japanese man presented with diarrhea, melena and perianal abscesses, and was
      diagnosed as having Crohn's disease. He was treated with oral prednisolone,
      salazosulfapyridine and diet therapy. However, the gastrointestinal symptoms
      recurred and he was hospitalized several times. In 1991, his thyroid gland was
      found to be swollen, but with normal thyroid function, and his thyroid gland
      became larger subsequently. In October 1995, he showed renal dysfunction (blood
      urea nitrogen 33.2 mg/dl; serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl) with proteinuria. His renal
      function had been deteriorating rapidly. On September 13, 1996, he was admitted
      to the Tsukuba University Hospital. At the time of admission, his renal function 
      showed a blood urea nitrogen of 129.5 mg/dl with a creatinine of 5.4 mg/dl. The
      urine contained 0.8 g of protein per 24 hours. He presented with diarrhea for
      several days before admission and was treated with central venous
      hyperalimentation. Despite supportive care, he developed end-stage renal failure,
      then hemodialysis was initiated on October 7. His condition was complicated by a 
      complete auriculoventricular block on October 18. He died of hemoperitoneum on
      October 25. On postmortem examination, extensive amyloid deposits were found in
      multiple organs including kidneys, intestine, heart, thyroid gland, lungs, liver,
      spleen, pancreas, gall bladder, adrenal glands, testis, prostate, bone marrow and
      parathyroid glands. Analysis of amyloid protein in the autopsy specimens showed
      type AA.

TI  - Modern life' in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control
      study with special emphasis on nutritional factors.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the
      Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim 
      of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some
      characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control,
      studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and
      398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age,
      gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression
      analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS:
      Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios.
      RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)],
      chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5
      (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption 
      of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There
      was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI
      0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6
      (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency 
      of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional
      items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of 
      a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD 
      which at the present are still unknown.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 235-7
AB  - During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of
      nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are 
      so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with
      Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.
      Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients
      with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however,
      when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical 
      approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, 
      which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant 
      patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies,
      have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been
      not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now
      switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of 
      elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the 
      amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the
      frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary
      fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are
      metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a
      beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now
      become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in patients with long-standing Crohn disease
      currently in remission.
PG  - 919-26
AB  - Malnutrition is observed frequently and is an important complication in patients 
      with Crohn disease (CD). The pathophysiology of malnutrition in this disorder is 
      complex. To obtain a comprehensive picture of nutritional status in patients with
      long-standing CD that was clinically in remission, we assessed four measures of
      nutritional status in 32 patients (18 women and 14 men) and 32 matched healthy
      control subjects: 1) body composition, 2) dietary intake, 3) biochemical indexes 
      of nutrition, and 4) and muscle strength (as a functional index). Mean daily
      intakes of fiber and phosphorus were significantly lower in CD patients than in
      control subjects. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene,
      vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc) and activity of the enzyme glutathione 
      peroxidase were also significantly lower in CD patients, as were antioxidant
      status and serum concentrations of magnesium and vitamin D. Percentage body fat
      and hamstring muscle strength were significantly lower in male CD patients than
      in control subjects, whereas muscle strength of the quadriceps was preserved. In 
      conclusion, this study showed a variety of nutritional and functional
      deficiencies in patients with long-standing CD in remission, especially in male
      patients with a high lifetime prednisone dose. A comprehensive nutritional
      assessment seems superior to the assessment of a single dimension of nutritional 
      status.

TI  - A review of associations between Crohn's disease and consumption of sugars.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To critically review the available literature reporting associations 
      between the onset of Crohn's disease and intakes of sugars or sugar-containing
      foods. To evaluate published evidence on the use of dietary manipulation of
      sugars in the treatment of Crohn's disease. DESIGN: All publications from
      refereed journals which reported intakes of sugars and sugar-containing foods in 
      the context of Crohn's disease onset or treatment were selected. CONCLUSION:
      Evidence suggesting a relationship between sugars and onset of Crohn's disease
      was inconsistent and subject to important methodological limitations. There was a
      clear lack of distinction between reporting of current, as opposed to,
      retrospective intakes. There appeared to be no clinical advantage to the use of
      reduced sugar diets in Crohn's disease treatment.

TI  - Nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 45-53
AB  - The value of nutritional support in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition 
      in Crohn's disease is undisputed but its role in primary therapy continues to be 
      debated. Controlled trials have demonstrated that enteral nutrition induces
      remission rates comparable to that of corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease
      and remains the treatment of choice for specific subgroups such as children with 
      signs of growth impairment and patients with intolerable steroid-induced side
      effects. The mechanism by which an enteral diet induces remission in Crohn's
      disease is unclear. Bowel rest, reduced antigenic load, nutritional effects, the 
      provision of trophic amino acids, modification of gut flora, intestinal
      permeability, or fecal pH have been proposed. Equally, the fat profile of the
      feed may reduce pro-inflammatory ecosanoid synthesis and thus modify disease
      activity. Maintaining long-term remission remains a challenge in the management
      of this disease. Cyclic administration of enteral diets, maintenance drug
      therapy, fat manipulated formulas, or fish oil therapy may be strategies to
      prolong diet-induced remission. In the future, nutrient derivatives that play a
      role in the protective processes of the intestinal mucosa may have application in
      nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease.

TI  - The role of the fecal stream in Crohn's disease: an historical and analytic
      review.
PG  - 29-39
AB  - Since 1939, a series of clinical reports and laboratory investigations have
      suggested that the intestinal fecal stream may play a significant part in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The beneficial effect of exclusion of the
      stream by ileostomy was followed by improvement in patients with CD of the ileum 
      and colon despite little change in the histopathology of the excluded loop, even 
      to the point of allowing restoration of intestinal continuity in some patients.
      End ileostomy lowers the risk of recurrence of CD compared with anastomotic
      operations. Ileostomy effluent can reactivate the clinical activity of quiescent 
      bypassed bowel and some of its biochemical processes, and may be related to an
      ultrafilterable constituent > 5 microns. Experimental models of inflammatory
      bowel disorders in immunologically altered rodents (transgenic, knockout, or
      spontaneous) require the presence of normal luminal bacteria, especially of the
      Bacteroides species, and respond to antibiotic (metronidazole) therapy. Thus,
      many but not all of the well-recognized clinical features of CD are compatible
      with a pathogenetic role of the fecal stream. Although difficult to quantitate,
      this concept opens the way to a variety of testable research lines, and allows
      some speculation regarding its clinical implications.

TI  - Severe muscle damage induced by high carbohydrate intake from elemental diet in a
      patient with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with complications in multiple organs. However,
      there are very few reported cases of patients with Crohn's disease with muscle
      symptoms and/or high serum creatine phospho-kinase (CPK) levels. We report here a
      patient with Crohn's disease who experienced skeletal muscle damage with
      extremely high serum CPK level during treatment with an elemental diet. The
      non-parenteral administration of large amounts of carbohydrate and limited
      glycogen degradation capability may be a possible causative mechanism for this
      elemental diet-induced muscle damage.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour energy balance in Crohn disease patients: metabolic implications
      of steroid treatment.
PG  - 118-23
AB  - Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nutritional deficiencies
      seen in Crohn disease patients, including inadequate food intake, decreased
      assimilation and increased loss of nutrients, and increased energy expenditure.
      To assess the effect of steroid therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, 
      and fuel selection in Crohn disease, we compared 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) 
      with biopsy-proven ileal Crohn disease with 11 healthy volunteers (6 men and 5
      women). Five patients [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) = 98.4 +/- 3.78]
      took no medication and seven patients (CDAI = 283.9 +/- 22.5) were administered
      29 +/- 18 mg prednisone/d. Body composition was evaluated by isotopic dilution
      and bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 24-h energy expenditure and basal
      metabolic rate were measured in a respiratory chamber. Fat-free mass was not
      significantly different among groups, whereas fat mass was lower in patients than
      in control subjects. Energy intake was higher in treated patients than in both
      untreated patients (P = 0.004) and control subjects (P = 0.005). Fecal losses
      were not significantly different between untreated patients and control subjects,
      but were higher (and proportional to the CDAI) in treated patients than in
      control subjects (P = 0.001). Metabolizable energy was not significantly
      different among groups, whereas energy balance was significantly higher in
      treated patients than in both control subjects (P = 0.0057) and untreated
      patients (P = 0.018). Nitrogen balance was mildly negative in treated patients
      compared with both control subjects and untreated patients, but not significantly
      so. In conclusion, prednisone treatment in Crohn disease patients stimulates food
      intake, promoting an overall positive energy balance despite large fecal nutrient
      losses.

TI  - Doppler sonography of the superior mesenteric artery in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 123-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate blood flow in the superior
      mesenteric artery (SMA) in patients with active and inactive Crohn's disease (CD)
      using Doppler sonography to dynamically assess the changes of resistance in both 
      fasting and postprandial states. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Doppler sonography of the 
      SMA was performed on 15 patients (mean age, 38 +/- 4 years) with active CD and on
      15 patients (mean age, 41 +/- 5 years) with inactive CD. Imaging was performed at
      both fasting and 15 min after an 1890-kJ meal. A preliminary examination of 10
      healthy volunteers with no signs of intestinal disease (mean age, 28 +/- 2 years)
      was necessary to define the parameters of normality. Because we wanted to express
      the postprandial resistive change in the SMA, we introduced a parameter called
      resistive difference (RD), defined as the mathematic difference between the
      resistive index measured at fasting (highest value) and measured at 15 min after 
      the meal (lowest value). RESULTS: By evaluating the relationship between the RD
      and extension of disease, we found a direct correlation between progressive
      extension of disease and reduction of the RD in patients with active CD
      (correlation coefficient, .98) whereas we found no such correlation in patients
      with inactive CD (correlation coefficient, .05). CONCLUSION: We believe that
      Doppler sonography of the SMA is a promising noninvasive method to detect
      inflammatory disease of the small bowel, to evaluate its extension, and to
      document resolution of disease after therapy.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind study of the effect of olestra on disease activity in 
      patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease. Olestra in IBD Study Group.
PG  - 389-99
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that 
      is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons 
      with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's
      disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer,
      were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three
      university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center 
      in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive
      olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At
      Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according
      to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative
      colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical
      course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ
      significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P =
      0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages
      of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630;
      difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41)
      given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of
      42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the
      treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.
      Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate
      IBD.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin secretion during continuous enteral
      nutrition.
PG  - 2274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, 
      resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder
      motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder
      motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients 
      with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet
      (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period.
      Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0
      (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the
      gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was 
      studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by
      radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0
      between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting
      gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and
      gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%,
      respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and
      mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with 
      fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN,
      the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and
      7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder
      volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly
      increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the
      gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that
      gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved
      during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Gastrointestinal motility disorders in patients with inactive Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1107-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although some symptoms of Crohn's disease may be related to
      gastrointestinal motility disorders, studies on gastrointestinal motility in
      inactive Crohn's disease are lacking. METHODS: Fasting and postprandial motor
      activity (1 h) was recorded in the gastric antrum and upper small intestine of 35
      patients with inactive Crohn's disease and 18 controls, using conventional
      manometry. RESULTS: Motor disorders were observed in 26 of 35 patients. The
      number of phase-II contractions was reduced (1.3 +/- 0.7/min versus 1.8 +/-
      0.6/min in controls; P < 0.02) (mean +/- standard deviation), whereas the
      incidence of propagated single (2.2 +/- 3.2/h versus 0.5 +/- 0.6/h; P < 0.03) and
      clustered contractions (3.8 +/- 7/h versus 1.1 +/- 1.4, P < 0.04) was markedly
      increased. Motor abnormalities were more frequent and severe in patients with
      Crohn's ileitis than in controls, and in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms 
      than in asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: Most patients with inactive,
      uncomplicated Crohn's disease show marked gastrointestinal motor disorders,
      characterized either by reduced incidence of small-bowel contractions and
      increased incidence of single or clustered propagated contractions.

TI  - Crohn's disease associated with renal amyloidosis successfully treated with an
      elemental diet.
PG  - 663-7
AB  - We report a case of Crohn's disease associated with nephrotic syndrome due to
      renal amyloidosis in a 21-year-old man in whom remission of both Crohn's disease 
      and the nephrotic syndrome has been maintained with an elemental diet. The
      patient developed toxic megacolon and nephrotic syndrome due to renal
      amyloidosis. Intensive intravenous prednisolone therapy with total parenteral
      nutrition was dramatically effective in treating the toxic megacolon and inducing
      remission in Crohn's disease and afterward, remission of the nephrotic syndrome. 
      Remission of both conditions has been maintained for more than 2 years with the
      elemental diet. To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of Crohn's
      disease complicated with renal amyloidosis in which only slight proteinuria
      (below 0.3 g/day) was shown with an elemental diet used for a long period.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - S48-53
AB  - UNLABELLED: Indication for and an evaluation of enteral nutrition in Crohn's
      disease differ between Japan and western countries. PURPOSE: Japanese results are
      reported and differences are discussed. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with an
      elemental diet is first-line therapy for active Crohn's disease in Japan. The
      remission induction rate of elemental diet therapy is approximately 80 percent,
      which is superior to steroids. Furthermore, elemental diet therapy induces
      radiographic and endoscopic remission. On the other hand, meta-analysis from
      randomized, controlled trials showed steroids to be more effective than enteral
      nutrition in western countries. The differences are considered to be the result
      of such differences as therapeutic duration of enteral nutrition, the composition
      of enteral diets used, criteria for remission, the quality of life score of a
      long-term fast with a nasogastric tube, medical care, and health insurance
      system. The main mechanism of the therapeutic effect of elemental diet is
      speculated to be attributable to removal of food antigens and decreases of
      secretion and motility (bowel rest) by very low fat. To prevent relapse and
      rehospitalization, home enteral nutrition is now used widely in Japan. The
      therapeutic effect is observed in patients with ileal involvement, and more than 
      1,200 kcal/day is more effective than a lower amount. CONCLUSION: Most Japanese
      studies were open-labeled, uncontrolled trials. We should conduct randomized,
      controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with steroids during the active
      stage of Crohn's disease and home enteral nutrition with drugs in maintaining
      remission and investigate the therapeutic effect, quality of life, and costs.

TI  - A randomized controlled study comparing elemental diet and steroid treatment in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 735-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elemental diet is considered an effective primary treatment for
      active Crohn's disease, but it is usually given by a feeding tube. METHODS:
      Twenty-two patients (12 males, median age 30 years, range 18-60) with moderately 
      active Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy 
      of an elemental diet administered orally was compared to high-dose
      corticosteroids in achieving clinical and laboratory remission. Ten patients were
      treated by oral elemental diet (Peptamen, Clintec, USA) and 10 received
      corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 2 weeks. The two groups did not
      differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, treatment or
      disease activity prior to the study. In all patients studied, simple Crohn's
      disease activity index, nutritional status (expressed as body mass index),
      percentage of ideal body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, interleukin-6, intestinal permeability (expressed as
      permeability index), prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test were 
      evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, there 
      were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, permeability index, body mass index, prealbumin, 
      retinol binding protein and multiskin test in the elemental diet group. There
      were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index and fat
      free mass in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in
      the short term, an oral elemental diet is at least as effective as steroids in
      inducing remission of mild-moderately active Crohn's disease, but it may be more 
      effective in improving the nutritional status of these patients, probably through
      a more rapid restoration of normal intestinal permeability.

TI  - Pre-illness dietary factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 754-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of environmental factors has been demonstrated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nutrition may be one of them.
      AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in
      comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
      dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for 
      IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose
      consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
      against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose 
      consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with
      risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was 
      associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal
      fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of
      fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was
      negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was
      found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
      except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative
      association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between 
      pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary
      components may be primary or modulatory.

TI  - Self-reported food intolerance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 569-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that
      food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to
      specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A 
      questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in
      Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had
      problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms
      experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included.
      RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had
      completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43
      years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC)
      were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of 
      the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more
      food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products.
      The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and
      meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common 
      in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease
      activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory
      bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may
      restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance
      did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably
      unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fat in the diet may improve intestinal function in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - To investigate the effect of increasing dietary polyunsaturated fat intake on fat
      absorption in Crohn's patients, normal subjects and subjects with inactive
      Crohn's disease consumed a high polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio diet.
      Subjects participated in breath tests before and after six months of a high
      polyunsaturated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio diet to measure their response to
      [1-13C] 10:0 and [1-13C] 16:0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body
      absorption-oxidation of C10:0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet
      treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C16:0 in Crohn's patients was 80%
      of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to 
      saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C16:0 by 85%
      compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption
      of labelled C16:0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2)
      consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves
      the utilization of dietary C16:0 by Crohn's patients.

TI  - [Current medical therapies for Crohn's disease in Japan].
PG  - 406-11
AB  - Current available therapies for Crohn's disease in Japan are reviewed in this
      report. Elemental diet is most effective for both inducing and maintaining
      remission in Japan. There appears to be no difference between elemental diet,
      oligopeptide diet and intact nutrients in effectiveness for active Crohn's
      disease. Although corticosteroid is also useful for treating active Crohn's
      disease, low dose of it is not effective for maintaining remission. Steroid has
      important role in combined therapy with elemental diet. New steroid, budesonide
      appears to be fascinate because of less adverse effects. Recently, instead of
      salazosulfapyridine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) proved to be more effective
      not only for active disease but also for maintenance of remission including small
      intestinal type of Crohn's disease with reduced adverse effects. Azathioprine,
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate and metronidazole are second choice
      treatment in patients whose disease relapse frequently. Although methotrexate
      appears to be effective for active Crohn's disease, the role of it has to be
      defined. Evidences support the use of 5-ASA and methotrexate for prophylaxis
      after surgery. It is important to chose and combine the therapies, thinking of
      the situation of each patient.

AB  - The relationships between non-specific inflammatory bowel disease and nutrition
      is considered. One of the hypotheses holds that environmental factors, especially
      those in dietary intake, can be the initiators of intestinal inflammation. In
      this connection authors examined a group of patients suffering from Crohns
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Results observed in patients with Crohns disease 
      indicate: preferred consumption of flour products, decreased intake of vegetables
      and fruit, lowered tolerance to milk and milk products, increased sugar
      consumption, increased proportion of smokers, no differences in diet regimen
      between nick and healthy subjects. (Tab. 3, Ref. 16.)

TI  - Experience of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in children with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 141-3
AB  - Enternal nutrition is an important mode of treatment for Crohn's disease in
      children. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been little used, even through 
      it can facilitate the administration of an unpalatable elemental diet to an
      anorexic, undernourished patients. Its use is reported in 10 children with
      Crohn's disease. The gastrostomy was found to be more acceptable than a
      nasogastric tube and was associated with only minor complications. As a
      consequence of improved delivery of enteral nutrition, in the year after the
      insertion of the gastrostomy there was a reduction in prednisolone dosage in all 
      patients, with six patients being able to stop prednisolone completely. The SD
      score for height also improved significantly. It is suggested that percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy is both useful and safe in the management of Crohn's
      disease in children, particularly when compliance with an elemental diet is
      likely to be poor.

TI  - Review article: the dietary management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 17-31
AB  - Enteral feeding has been shown to be as effective as primary therapy for Crohn's 
      disease, but it requires high patient motivation, may be unpalatable and is
      expensive. However, in adolescents with growth failure and when corticosteroid
      therapy is contra-indicated or has failed, it may become the treatment of choice.
      Furthermore, dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of 
      repeated courses of steroids. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed
      to explain the effect of enteral feeds but none has reached universal acceptance.
      Prospective trials suggest that the exclusion of whole protein is not necessary. 
      Comparison of feeds with differing composition suggests that a low fat content
      increases efficacy and various explanations have been offered. The reduction of
      colonic bacterial load may also be important. Because symptoms of Crohn's disease
      may be provoked by eating, there is a risk of falsely attributing symptoms to
      specific foodstuffs. However, in many individuals foods can be identified which
      affect disease activity, and their exclusion leads to prolongation of disease
      remission. Dietetic supervision during food testing is important to avoid
      detrimental effects on nutrient and micronutrient intake.

TI  - Dairy sensitivity, lactose malabsorption, and elimination diets in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 564-7
AB  - The ability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to tolerate dairy
      products and the guidance they receive from physicians and nutritionists on this 
      subject are important considerations in the management of their IBD. Although
      most affected persons are able to consume a glass of milk daily without
      discomfort, additional consideration must be given to specific factors that can
      be relevant to certain individuals. The declaration by patients that they are
      "dairy sensitive" may be related to lactose intolerance or malabsorption, the
      long-chain triacylglycerol content of milk, allergy to milk proteins, as well as 
      psychologic factors and the misconception that dairy products can be detrimental 
      to their health. The prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly greater
      in patients with Crohn disease involving the small bowel than it is in patients
      with Crohn disease involving the colon or ulcerative colitis. In the latter
      colonic conditions the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is mainly determined
      by ethnic risk, which is based on genetic factors. In addition, lactose
      malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may be determined by factors
      other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth and/or small
      bowel transit time. Physicians differ widely in the advice they give their
      patients: some dogmatically advise avoidance of dairy products when the diagnosis
      is made whereas others discount the possible role of dairy in the management of
      IBD. IBD patients avoid dairy products more than they would need to based on the 
      prevalence of lactose malabsorption and/or milk intolerance, probably partly
      because of incorrect patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and
      authors of popular diet books. Adequate scientific and clinical information is
      now available to permit recommendations about the intake of dairy products for
      each IBD patient.
