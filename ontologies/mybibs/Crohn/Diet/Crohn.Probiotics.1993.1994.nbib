TI  - Effects of new fish oil derivative on fatty acid phospholipid-membrane pattern in
      a group of Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 2589-94
AB  - Fish oil has been recently proposed as a possible effective treatment in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, a lot of annoying side effects (ie,
      belching, halitosis, diarrhea, etc) affect patient compliance. We carried out a
      study of patient tolerance in a group of Crohn's disease (CD) patients with a new
      fish oil derivative consisting of 500-mg capsules of
      eicosapentaenoic-docosahexaenoic (EPA 40%-DHA 20%), a free fatty acid mixture
      (Purepa), and we also evaluated its incorporation into phospholipids, both in
      plasma and in red cell membranes. Five groups of 10 CD patients in remission
      received nine Purepa capsules daily in four different preparations (A: uncoated, 
      B: coated, pH 5.5; C: coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time release; D: coated, pH 6.9) and
      12 x 1-g capsules daily of a triglyceride preparation (Max-EPA, EPA 18%-DHA 10%),
      respectively. We coated three of the four Purepa preparations in order to delay
      the release of contents in an attempt to minimize the side effects. After six
      weeks of treatment, the group taking Purepa capsules, coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time
      release (group C) showed the best incorporation of EPA and DHA in red blood cell 
      phospholipid membranes (EPA from 0.2 to 4.4%, DHA from 3.7 to 6.3%), and no side 
      effects were registered, whereas in all other groups side effects were
      experienced in 50% or more of subjects. This new preparation will make it
      possible to treat patients for long periods.

TI  - Polymeric nutrition as the primary therapy in children with small bowel Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 609-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies in adults have shown that polymeric (whole protein)
      diets are as effective as semi-elemental and elemental formulae for the induction
      of remission in small bowel Crohn's disease. Whole protein diets are more
      palatable and cheaper. There have been no studies confirming efficacy in
      children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience with seven children with
      active small bowel Crohn's disease given a casein-based, polymeric feed rich in
      TGF-beta 2 (Specific Polymeric Diet; Nestle-Clintec; Vevey, Switzerland) as
      complete nutrition for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Initial and follow-up assessments were
      performed. All children showed a significant improvement in disease activity,
      with C-reactive protein returning to normal, an increase in serum albumin and a
      good weight gain. Initial and follow-up ileal biopsies were assessed and showed
      reduced mucosal inflammation in six of seven children, with complete healing in
      two. CONCLUSION: In an uncontrolled descriptive study we have shown that a
      polymeric (whole protein) diet is a therapeutic option for small bowel Crohn's
      disease in children. By comprehensive follow-up we have demonstrated clinical and
      biochemical remission, with an improved endoscopic appearance and a reduction of 
      mucosal inflammation in the terminal ileum.

TI  - Mechanisms of decreased food intake during weight loss in adult Crohn's disease
      patients without obvious malabsorption.
PG  - 775-81
AB  - Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated
      with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without
      malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients
      without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with
      weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group,
      food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed
      less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to
      eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was
      also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no
      difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure.
      Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather
      than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on
      the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin release during long-term enteral
      nutrition in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 934-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallbladder bile stasis during long-term continuous enteral feeding
      may contribute to the high prevalence of gallstones in patients with Crohn's
      disease. We therefore examined the effects of continuous enteral nutrition on
      gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin (CCK) release in six patients. METHODS: 
      Gallbladder volume was measured ultrasonographically for 12 h on days 1 (start), 
      8, 22 (6-h interruption of enteral feeding), 36, and 43 (end) of enteral feeding.
      Plasma CCK was assessed at several time points. RESULTS: Initial fasting
      gallbladder volume was 19.3 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SEM) ml, which decreased to 4.9 +/-
      3.6 ml after start of feeding. CCK increased from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.9 +/- 1.1
      pmol/l. On days 8 and 36 the gallbladder was almost completely contracted, and
      CCK increased to 7.5 +/- 2.7 and 8.3 +/- 2.6 pmol/l, respectively. On days 22 and
      43 gallbladder volume increased, and CCK decreased rapidly to fasting
      concentrations after interruption of feeding. CONCLUSIONS: During continuous
      enteral nutrition the gallbladder is completely contracted, and CCK
      concentrations remain elevated. It is therefore unlikely that long-term enteral
      nutrition contributes to the increased prevalence of gallstones in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Randomized controlled trial of amino acid based diet versus oligopeptide based
      diet in enteral nutritional therapy of active Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1415-25
AB  - This study compared the short-term effect of semi-elemental diet in treatment of 
      active Crohn's disease with elemental diet which has been reported to be
      successful in inducing remission. The important differences between
      semi-elemental diet and elemental diet in composition are the form of nitrogen
      and fat content. Forty patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to
      receive for 6 weeks either elemental diet (n = 21) which is composed of amino
      acid based with low fat content or semi-elemental diet (n = 19) which is
      oligopeptide-based and has higher fat content. Both groups showed similar
      improvement in Dutch-AI, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, body mass index and
      radiographic findings of bowel lesion. The present study suggests that
      semi-elemental diet is equal to elemental diet for treating active Crohn's
      disease. We conclude the compositional differences between the two diets did not 
      affect the short-term effect of enteral nutritional therapy for active Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Selenium and glutathione peroxidase status in paediatric health and
      gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 213-9
AB  - To examine the effect of paediatric GI disease on selenium concentration in
      plasma and glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma and red cells, results in
      children with Crohn's disease (n = 39), cystic fibrosis (n = 14), intractable
      diarrhoea (n = 13), and biliary atresia (n = 10) were compared with those from 86
      healthy children undergoing routine operations. In Crohn's disease, plasma
      selenium concentrations were rarely low, but glutathione peroxidase activity was 
      increased in the plasma and reduced in the red cells. Selenium concentration and 
      glutathione peroxidase activity increased with steroid treatment but decreased
      with a selenium-deficient elemental diet. Plasma selenium concentration was
      normal in children with cystic fibrosis but very low in severely malnourished
      children with biliary atresia and intractable diarrhoea. Selenium concentration
      and glutathione peroxidase activity should be monitored in children with severe
      malnutrition or requiring prolonged nutritional support. Supplementation is
      recommended in cases of severe selenium depletion.

TI  - Exclusive whole protein enteral diet versus prednisolone in the treatment of
      acute Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - Nineteen children with either newly diagnosed or relapsed Crohn's disease were
      enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of enteral feeding with a
      whole protein-based formula was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in
      achieving clinical remission and normalization of laboratory measurements. Ten
      children were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia), and nine 
      received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 11 weeks. The activity
      of Crohn's disease was similar in both groups before the commencement of the
      treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's
      disease activity index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity
      (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet
      count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status
      (concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved rapidly and
      significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment in both treatment groups. In
      both groups, there was one relapse within 8 weeks after discontinuation of
      treatment, and one patient in both groups was operated on during the treatment
      period. During the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3
      years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical relapse, whereas
      only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed. No side effects of enteral
      feeding were seen. Enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula proved to
      be as effective as high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase
      of Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in pediatric
      patients with acute Crohn's disease.

TI  - Comparison of amino acid v peptide based enteral diets in active Crohn's disease:
      clinical and nutritional outcome.
PG  - 783-7
AB  - Elemental diets are considered an effective primary treatment for active Crohn's 
      disease. This study examined the hypothesis that improvement occurs because of
      the presence of amino acids or the low fat content, or both. A randomised,
      controlled trial was undertaken in 40 patients with active Crohn's disease to
      evaluate clinical and nutritional outcomes after an amino acid based diet
      containing 3% fat was given by a feeding tube compared with a peptide based diet 
      containing 33% fat. After three weeks' treatment, clinical remission occurred in 
      84% of patients who were given the amino acid diet and 75% of patients who
      received the peptide diet (p = 0.38). Plasma linoleic acid concentration was
      reduced after the amino acid but not the peptide diet. An increase in total body 
      nitrogen was associated with the magnitude of nutritional depletion before
      treatment and at six months' follow up, only patients who showed gains in total
      body nitrogen after enteral nutrition had a sustained clinical remission. This
      study shows that peptide based high fat diets are as effective as amino acid low 
      fat diets for achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. Improved
      total body protein stores but not essential fatty acid depletion may be an
      important indicator of a sustained remission.

TI  - Radiological investigation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 101-19
AB  - The radiological investigations relevant to chronic IBD are described briefly
      with emphasis placed on compression techniques in small bowel studies. A
      classification for reporting small bowel Crohn's disease is proposed, where the
      disease is staged as early, advanced or complicated, and the extent of
      involvement measured directly from the film. The terminal ileum may be normal in 
      20% of children with proximal Crohn's disease, so that ileoscopy should not be
      used to exclude small bowel disease. Radiological assessment of the small bowel
      is important in management. Surgical referral was based on the radiological
      changes in 6% of patients, and in 24% the presence of extensive uncomplicated
      small bowel Crohn's disease led to treatment with elemental diet. The use of some
      specialized examinations, such as the instant and ileostomy enema, are discussed.

TI  - Crohn disease: early recognition and progress of aphthous lesions.
PG  - 451-4
AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the radiographic appearance of the initial change an
      dprogression in Crohn disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1992, nine
      patients (seven men and two women, aged 16-34 years; mean, 20 years) with Crohn
      disease, who had evidence of only aphthous erosions or ulcers at the initial
      examination, underwent repeated radiography for up to 7 years 11 months (median, 
      4 years). RESULTS: In all patients, the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and
      colorectum were involved, and the esophagus was affected in three patients.
      Subsequently, four of the nine patients had lesions that progressed from aphthous
      lesions to overt Crohn disease, including ileitis in two patients, colitis in
      one, and ileocolitis in one. Time intervals between the first visit and the
      progression varied from 9 months to 3 years 6 months. In all eight patients who
      underwent nutritional treatment, regression of the lesions was recognized, but
      three of the lesions progressed during interruption of the nutritional diet.
      CONCLUSION: Crohn disease may initially appear as diffuse aphthous lesions in the
      gastrointestinal mucosa.

TI  - Enteral nutrition as primary therapy in Crohn's disease.
PG  - S55-9
AB  - The developments in enteral feeding for Crohn's disease in the past decade are
      critically reviewed. The advent of amino acid based chemically defined elemental 
      diets signalled the end of 'total bowel rest' in the management of these
      patients. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials showed that elemental diets
      were as effective as corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission in patients
      with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. The later use of peptide based
      elemental diets, in Crohn's disease produced somewhat conflicting results. The
      initial uncontrolled studies suggest that polymeric whole protein diets might
      also be effective in the management of acute exacerbations of the disease,
      casting in turn doubts concerning the role of dietary antigens in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Results of controlled studies comparing the use 
      of elemental and polymeric diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease have,
      however, also produced conflicting results. The results of one recent controlled 
      trial in which the use of polymeric diet was compared with that of
      corticosteroids does, however, suggest that these diets may have a primary
      therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease. An analysis of the composition of some of 
      the enteral diets used in different trials suggest that the effectiveness of
      enteral diets in treating active Crohn's disease might relate more to their fat
      than nitrogen composition. A hypothesis is proposed that the effectiveness of
      enteral nutrition in the primary therapy of acute exacerbations of Crohn's
      disease occurs because the successful diets used contain insufficient precursors 
      for arachidonate derived eicosanoid synthesis.

AB  - Corticosteroids are an efficient treatment for active Crohn's disease. The
      treatment has to be undertaken with a daily intake equivalent to 1 mg/kg per day 
      of prednisolone for a 3 to 7 week period. Immunosuppressive agents are indicated 
      in case of corticodependency or in case of large intestinal resection. Artificial
      nutrition (enteral or parenteral) is proposed in corticoresistant forms, and is
      usually followed by an immunosuppressive therapy. Surgical management is reserved
      for complications, including resistance to all medical therapy. Surgical
      resection has to be limited in order to avoid a short bowel syndrome. Surgery
      should not be considered as the ideal therapy as it has been demonstrated that
      recurrence after surgery increases at distance. 5-aminosalycilates compounds are 
      an alternative therapy in mild attacks. Mesalazine may reduce the recurrence and 
      could be considered as a possible maintenance treatment.

PG  - 727-34
AB  - Experimental investigations have shown alterations of the ileal mucosal surface
      after specific fat diets resembling early changes in Crohn's disease. An animal
      experiment in pigs has been conducted. After creation of an anisoperistaltic
      segment these were fed either a specific fat diet containing chemically
      processed, partially hydrogenated fats or a low fat control diet over a period of
      3 months. Defined areas of the ileal lamina propria were examined by transmission
      electron microscopy with the underlying question to what extent ultrastructural
      alterations could be compared to Crohn's disease. In comparison to the control
      group these areas were characterized by a dense infiltration of "inflammatory"
      cells like lymphocytes, histiocytes, macrophages and plasma cells indicating a
      hyperplasia and activation of lympho-plasmocytotic cells. Additionally, a focal
      prominent infiltration of mast cells with degranulation was observed as well as a
      dilatation of axons with depletion of axonal organelles in half of the animals
      after fat-feeding. Compared to patients with Crohn's disease the results show
      obvious similarities. It is concluded, that chemically processed fats could cause
      direct stimulation of immunologically-specific and non-specific cells in the
      lamina propria mucosae or directly injure the intestinal mucosa with secondary
      infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria.

TI  - Maintenance of symptomatic remission in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1183-90
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disorder characterized in
      most patients by repeated episodes of diminished and exacerbated symptoms. Recent
      controlled trials demonstrated that oral preparations of 5-aminosalicylic acid
      decrease recurrence rates by approximately 40% when administered long-term to
      patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. Orally administered corticosteroids,
      sulfasalazine, metronidazole, azathioprine, and cyclosporine have not proved of
      benefit in the prevention of recurrences of Crohn's disease. Nonetheless,
      corticosteroids, metronidazole, and azathioprine can control chronically active
      disease. Methotrexate may have some benefit in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease, but its role in maintenance of remission has not been investigated.
      Elimination diets seem to prolong periods of symptomatic remission. Further
      studies are needed to define subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit
      from preventive therapy.

PG  - 1131-4
AB  - Elemental diet is as effective in producing remission of Crohn's disease (CD) as 
      is corticosteroid treatment, but most patients relapse soon after resumption of a
      normal diet. We have investigated the efficacies of dietary modification and oral
      corticosteroids in maintaining remission achieved with elemental diet. In a
      multicentre trial, 136 patients with active CD were started on elemental diet and
      other treatment was withdrawn. 43 (31%) declined to continue elemental diet for
      14 days, but 78 (84%) of the remaining 93 achieved remission and were randomly
      assigned corticosteroids (38) or diet (40). Corticosteroid treatment started at
      40 mg prednisolone daily, which was tapered and stopped after 12 weeks; that
      group received dietary advice on healthy eating. The diet group received
      "tapered" placebo and were instructed to introduce one new food daily, excluding 
      any that precipitated symptoms. Assessment of progress for up to 2 years was made
      by physicians unaware of group assignment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed
      median lengths of remission of 3.8 (interquartile range 5.0) months in the
      corticosteroid group and 7.5 (15.3) months on diet, and relapse rates at 2 years,
      adjusted for withdrawals, of 79% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.048). Clinical
      improvement in the diet group was associated with significant changes in plasma
      albumin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentrations and erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate. Food intolerances discovered were predominantly to cereals, dairy products,
      and yeast. Diet provides a further therapeutic strategy in active Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Serum interleukin-8 in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 508-12
AB  - To investigate the relationship between serum concentrations of interleukin-8
      (IL-8) and disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, serum IL-8
      concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 93
      patients. Interleukin-8 levels were compared with plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      levels in 80 of these patients. Interleukin-8 levels were also measured in ten
      patients with active Crohn's disease, before and after treatment with a defined
      formula polymeric diet. Of these patients, 70 out of 93 IL-8 concentrations were 
      below the detection limit of the assay. Levels were higher in patients with
      active ulcerative colitis (median < 20 pg/mL, 75th centile value = 190) compared 
      with inactive disease (median and 75th centile value < 20; P < 0.05).
      Interleukin-8 concentrations correlated with a combined score for disease
      severity and extent (P = 0.01). Thirty-eight per cent (8/20) of patients with
      active Crohn's disease also had high levels of IL-8 but there was no significant 
      difference between active and inactive disease. There was no correlation between 
      serum IL-8 and plasma IL-6; on the contrary, very few patients had raised blood
      levels of both cytokines. In the diet treated group, serum IL-8 fell
      significantly after treatment (median = 37 pg/mL, range < 20-4615 before
      treatment, median < 20, range < 20-104 after treatment; P = 0.03). The results
      suggest that although IL-8 may be involved in the inflammatory process in
      inflammatory bowel disease, it is a poor marker of disease activity.

PG  - 2882-8
AB  - The long term efficacy of low residue diet (LRD) for the maintenance of remission
      in patients with Crohn's disease was studied. The patients consisted of 60 with
      quiescent Crohn's disease who were given LRD (Clinimeal or Ensure Liquid) for
      maintenance therapy for more than one year (average 2.4 years) after discharge
      from our institute. On the basis of the quantity of LRD given per day, the
      patients were classified into three groups: A; O to 799 kcal a day, B; 800 to
      1599 kcal a day and C; more than 1600 kcal a day. The remission rate and the
      avoidance rate of admission were calculated and compared among three groups. The 
      remission rate in group C was significantly higher than those in groups A and B. 
      The avoidance rates of admission in groups B and C were significantly higher than
      that in group A. These results suggest that drinking of LRD at home is useful for
      the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease and that the effect
      of LRD depends on the quantity of LRD given per day.

TI  - Reduced metabolic efficiency in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2001-9
AB  - Malnutrition is frequently seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and 
      parenteral or enteral nutrition is considered essential in this patient group.
      However, many patients with Crohn's disease have difficulties in gaining weight
      in response to overfeeding, suggesting reduced energy retention. Substrate
      utilization and nutrient balances as well as changes in body composition were
      followed in 10 patients with Crohn's disease immediately in the course of
      remission on low-dose steroid treatment, during an eight-day period of continuous
      enteral nutrition at constant (protocol 1:1.5-fold basal energy expenditure) and 
      increasing (protocol 2:0.5- to 2.0-fold basal energy expenditure) nutrient
      supply. Energy, substrate, and nitrogen balances all became positive in response 
      to overfeeding. However, fat was predominantly oxidized at an infusion rate of
      1.2 g/kg body wt/day, whereas carbohydrates and proteins were effectively stored.
      A positive energy balance was reached at an energy infusion rate exceeding 31
      kcal/kg body wt/day and corresponding substrate supplies of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.1
      g/kg body wt/day for carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively. Nitrogen
      balance normalized at a supply of 0.14 g/kg body wt/day, which also reduced
      myofibrillar protein breakdown. Considering the relative contributions made by
      these nutrients in the diets, an accumulation of carbohydrates and protein but a 
      depletion in fat became evident from nutrient balances. In fact, body weight
      increased by 0.12 kg/day, which was explained by an increased extracellular
      (+0.18 kg/day) and body cell mass (+0.04 kg/day) at reduced fat mass (-0.10
      kg/day). Concomitantly, plasma T3 and insulin secretion both increased, whereas
      sympathetic nervous system activity decreased with overfeeding. This is contrary 
      to data observed in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Initial response and subsequent course of Crohn's disease treated with elemental 
      diet or prednisolone.
PG  - 1198-202
AB  - Elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroids in the treatment of previously 
      untreated Crohn's disease. It is unclear whether a poor nutritional state is a
      prerequisite for efficacy of elemental diet, whether previously treated patients 
      respond as well, or how duration of remission using elemental diet compares with 
      corticosteroid induced remission. Forty two patients with active Crohn's disease 
      were stratified for nutritional state and randomised to receive Vivonex TEN 2.1
      l/day for four weeks, or 0.75 mg prednisolone/kg/day for two weeks and subsequent
      reducing doses. Nine of 22 (41%) patients assigned to nutritional treatment were 
      intolerant of the diet. Thirty patients completed four weeks treatment. Disease
      activity decreased on elemental diet from mean (SEM) 4.8 (0.9) to 1.7 (0.6), p < 
      0.05, and on prednisolone from 5.3 (0.5) to 1.9 (0.6), p < 0.05. For each
      treatment, nourished and malnourished patients responded similarly. Patients with
      longstanding disease responded as well as newly diagnosed patients. The
      probability of maintaining remission at six months was 0.67 after prednisolone,
      0.28 after elemental diet, and at one year was 0.35 after prednisolone and 0.09
      after elemental diet, p < 0.05. When tolerated, elemental diet is as effective in
      the short term as prednisolone in newly and previously diagnosed Crohn's disease,
      and its benefit is independent of nutritional state. The subsequent relapse rate 
      after elemental diet induced remission, however, is greater than after treatment 
      with prednisolone.

TI  - Does exclusion of enteral lipid assist remission in Crohn's disease?
PG  - 38-41
AB  - Based on the improvement of Crohn's disease (CD) with elemental diets, we treated
      a patient with recurrent stenosing disease using prednisolone and drastic
      reduction of oral lipid intake. Complete symptomatic and good radiological
      improvement took place. A newly proposed hypothesis for CD suggests that enteral 
      lipids together with certain luminal bacterial fragments become strongly
      antigenic to produce an inflammatory reaction analogous to the adjuvant response.
      Because of the apparent success of dietary lipid exclusion in this patient, we
      suggest that it be considered as a future option for management of acute CD.

TI  - Dietary intake and nutritional treatment in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - Dietary intake was assessed in 24 children with active Crohn's disease. Seventeen
      of the children were sex and height matched with healthy siblings of other
      patients. The mean energy intake was 1,764 KJ/day (420 kcal/day) lower in
      patients during relapse than controls (p < 0.05). All 24 children entered a
      randomised controlled trial of high-dose steroids compared to an elemental diet. 
      The elemental diet was well tolerated orally in most cases; only one patient
      required nasogastric administration. There was a similar improvement in disease
      activity and duration of remission in both groups regardless of the site of
      disease. Subsequent growth velocity was significantly better in the group treated
      with the elemental diet despite a greater and more sustained increase in energy
      intake in the group treated with steroids. Reintroduction of specific foods in
      the elemental diet group initially caused symptoms in three children but were
      subsequently tolerated. During remission, there was no significant difference in 
      energy intake, but vegetables were consumed significantly less frequently (p <
      0.01) and confectionery significantly more frequently (p < 0.05) when patients
      were compared with their own siblings.

TI  - Growth and clinical course of children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 939-43
AB  - Growth impairment is a common complication of childhood Crohn's disease, but
      longitudinal data and follow up studies into adulthood are sparse. This study
      reviewed the records of 100 Tanner stages 1 and 2 children (66 males, 34 females)
      consecutively diagnosed with Crohn's disease at this hospital between January
      1980 and June 1988. The influence of sex, anatomical location of disease,
      severity of symptoms, corticosteroids, and surgical intervention on growth were
      analysed by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. At diagnosis mean
      standard deviation score (SDS) for height was -1.11 (1.28) (males -1.14 (1.26),
      females -1.05 (1.33)). Twenty one children were below the third centile for
      height. During years one and two height velocity (cm/y) was 4.4 (2.3) and 5.1
      (2.7), but 40% of children in year one and 33% of children in year two grew less 
      than expected (< 4 cm). Forty nine children grew < 4 cm/y during two or more of
      the 4.9 (1.8) years of follow up. Severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was the
      major factor influencing linear growth velocity (p < 0.01 for years one and two).
      Despite the high prevalence of growth impairment, the subset of children who had 
      reached maturity by the time of the study (n = 67) nevertheless maintained their 
      height centile. The SDS for height at ultimate follow up was -0.82 (1.1).
      Compared with diagnosis, change in SDS was +0.35 (1.08). Growth increments were
      comparable for surgically treated patients v patients only treated medically and 
      among patients stratified by location of disease. Females (n = 25) achieved
      greater catch up growth than males (n = 42). Ultimate SDS for height for females 
      was -0.48 (0.91) v -1.02 (1.19) for males. Change in SDS for height was +0.66
      (1.27) for females v +0.16 (0.90) for males (p=0.02). These data confirm the
      frequency of growth impairment in childhood Crohn's disease. After diagnosis,
      however, the prognosis for ultimate linear growth is good.

PG  - 944-7
AB  - Twenty nine children with Crohn's disease were studied before and after treatment
      with steroids or an elemental diet to assess the effect of disease activity and
      treatment on serum insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin like growth
      factor binding protein (IGFBP-1), and insulin concentrations. The median serum
      IGF-I concentration was lower in patients with active disease than in matched
      controls, and lower in stunted than well grown patients, but insulin and IGFBP-1 
      concentrations were not significantly different between any group. After four
      weeks of either treatment there was an increase in the median serum IGF-I
      concentration; this was greater in the steroid group than the elemental diet
      group. The median serum insulin concentration increased and median serum IGFBP-1 
      concentration decreased in the steroid treated group but not in the elemental
      diet group. These changes were accompanied by a greater and more sustained
      increase in energy intake in the steroid group. Despite this the median height
      velocity SD score was greater in the elemental diet group than in the steroid
      group.

      assessed after induction of remission with elemental diet in 42 eligible patients
      to whom single foods were introduced over five days. Suspect foods were
      reinvestigated with open and if possible, double blind rechallenge. Fourteen
      patients (33%) dropped out of the study because of relapse of disease unrelated
      to food (n = 8) or because of difficulties in complying with the regimen (n = 6).
      Twenty (48%) of the patients identified food sensitivities whereas eight (19%)
      did not. Seventeen of the patients who identified food sensitivities had an open 
      rechallenge with recurrence of symptoms in 10 (24% of total). Food sensitivity
      was confirmed in three patients on double blind challenge. There was no
      significant difference in the duration of remission between patients who did or
      did not identify food sensitivities. During the study three cases of intolerance 
      to the formula diet, and one of severe salicylate sensitivity were encountered.
      In conclusion food sensitivities are evident after treatment of Crohn's disease
      with elemental diet but are variable, often do not persist, and are of
      insufficient importance to warrant putting all patients through elimination
      diets.

TI  - Polymeric enteral diets as primary treatment of active Crohn's disease: a
      prospective steroid controlled trial.
PG  - 778-82
AB  - Thirty two patients with active Crohn's disease were included in a controlled
      randomised trial to determine the efficacy and safety of polymeric enteral
      nutrition compared with steroids, to achieve and maintain clinical remission. The
      polymeric diet was administered through a fine bore nasogastric tube by
      continuous, pump assisted infusion (2800 (SEM 120) kcal/day). The steroid group
      received 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. Both treatments were effective in inducing
      clinical remission: 15 of the 17 patients given steroids and 12 of the 15
      patients assigned to the polymeric diet went into clinical remission (defined by 
      a Van Hees index < 120) within four weeks of treatment. The percentage reduction 
      of the Van Hees index was 34.8 (4.9)% for steroids and 32.3 (5)% for enteral
      nutrition (mean difference 2.5%; 95% CI--11.8% to +16.8%). Mean time elapsed to
      achieve remission was similar in both groups (2.0 (1) v 2.4 (1.2) weeks).
      Tolerance of the enteral diet was excellent. Four patients in the steroid group
      had mild complications attributable to this treatment. Ten patients (66.6%) in
      the steroid group and five (41.6%) in the enteral nutrition group relapsed within
      a year of discharge, but no differences were found in the cumulative probability 
      of relapse during the follow up period. These results suggest that polymeric
      enteral nutrition is as safe and effective as steroids in inducing short term
      remission in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Home elemental enteral hyperalimentation (HEEH) for the maintenance of remission 
      in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 379-84
AB  - Since specific treatment has not yet been decided on for Crohn's disease, the
      immediate target is the induction of remission and its maintenance. We examined
      the effects of an elemental diet (ED) in Crohn's disease with special reference
      to the maintenance of remission. Eighty-four patients received total enteral
      nutrition with the ED (35 to 40 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and/or
      conventional drug treatment for induction of remission. Sixty-one patients in
      remission were then followed-up with prolonged ED therapy (home elemental enteral
      hyperalimentation, HEEH) and/or drugs. During the follow-up periods the course of
      patients receiving HEEH was better than those of patients without HEEH, namely
      the cumulative continuous remission rates after one, 2 and 4 years were, 94%, 63%
      and 63% in the group receiving HEEH, 75%, 66% and 66% in the group receiving HEEH
      and drugs, 63%, 42% and 0% in the group receiving drugs, and 50%, 33% and 0% in
      the group receiving no maintenance therapy, respectively. In particular, when
      more than 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day of the ED was given, the maintenance
      of remission was successful in 95% of the patients. These results indicated that 
      ED therapy was effective not only for the induction of remission but also for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Orocaecal transit time in patients with Crohn disease.
PG  - 193-6
AB  - Orocaecal transit time (OCTT) using the lactulose hydrogen breath test was
      investigated in 16 patients (age 10-19.4 years) with active Crohn disease (CD).
      Disease activity was assessed by the paediatric CD activity index (PCDAI). OCTT
      was prolonged in all patients (mean 149.9 min, SD 32.7) relative to healthy
      age-matched controls (mean 56.9 min, SD 11.1). PCDAI was increased (median 48.8, 
      range 32.5), indicating moderate to severe disease in all patients. A close
      correlation between OCTT and PCDAI (Spearman r = 0.90) was observed. Following
      nutritional therapy with a semi-elemental diet over a period of 6 weeks OCTT and 
      PCDAI declined, OCTT becoming normal in 4 and PCDAI in 4/12 patients
      respectively. OCTT provides a sensitive, non-invasive method for the assessment
      and followup investigations in patients with CD.

TI  - Life quality and psychological morbidity with an ileostomy.
PG  - 252-3
AB  - The recent introduction of restorative proctocolectomy for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis has reopened the debate about the effects of ileostomy on
      quality of life. This study analysed life quality and psychological morbidity in 
      113 patients with an ileostomy using a postal questionnaire which included
      questions about their opinion of the pouch operation. Of the questionnaires, 73
      per cent were suitable for analysis. A total of 93 per cent of those responding
      were happy with the ileostomy and appeared to have adapted to a normal life with 
      it. Some 87 per cent stated that they would keep the ileostomy in preference to
      an ileoanal pouch. In addition, psychological morbidity as assessed by the
      General Health Questionnaire occurred in only 5 per cent of patients.

TI  - Total energy expenditure in patients with Crohn's disease: measurement by the
      combined body scan technique.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - A combined body scan technique for measuring total energy expenditure (TEE) from 
      energy intake and changes in energy stores is presented. The TEE of 13 patients
      with Crohn's disease who required nutrition support over a 14-day period was
      measured. They had a mean TEE of 33 kcal/kg per day. The components of the TEE in
      these 13 patients were also measured. Seventy percent of the TEE was made up by
      resting metabolic expenditure, 10% by diet-induced thermogenesis, and the
      remaining 20% by activity energy expenditure. These patients had a mean activity 
      energy expenditure of 369 kcal/day. The diet-induced thermogenesis was a mean
      12.6% increase on the resting metabolic expenditure. Each percent increase was
      caused by a mean of 210 kcal of energy in either the intravenous nutrition or the
      enteral nutrition. There was no difference in diet-induced thermogenesis between 
      those having enteral nutrition and those receiving intravenous nutrition.
      Decreased activity was significantly correlated with increased activity of the
      disease (r = .7, p < .01). This confirms the belief that patients with Crohn's
      disease require no more energy (ie, 33 kcal/kg per day) than other patients. If
      the resting metabolic expenditure is increased through illness, then the activity
      energy expenditure decreases. The combined in vivo neutron activation-dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry technique has allowed for the first time measurements in
      ward patients with Crohn's disease. The measurements confirm that TEE is not
      raised and that 30 to 35 kcal/kg per day is sufficient to achieve energy balance 
      in such patients.

TI  - Trefoil peptide gene expression in small intestinal Crohn's disease and dietary
      adaptation.
PG  - S78-91
AB  - We examined the patterns of trefoil peptide gene expression in the
      ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL) and mucosa adjacent to Crohn's disease in
      humans and during gastrointestinal adaptation to enteral feeding in rats. In the 
      UACL, human spasmolytic polypeptide (hSP) mRNA and peptide are present in the
      acinar and proximal duct cells, whereas pS2 mRNA and peptide are found in the
      distal duct cells and in the surface cells. In mucosa adjacent to UACL, pS2 mRNA 
      and peptide are expressed ectopically by goblet cells and neuroendocrine cells.
      Intestinal crypts associated with the UACL showed marked neuroendocrine cell
      hyperplasia. Ultrastructural immunolocalization showed pS2 to be copackaged in
      the mucous cell and neuroendocrine granules. The copackaging of a secretory
      protein in both mucous and neuroendocrine granules, which have different
      functions, is unusual and indicates an important role for pS2 in the secretory
      process itself or as a ligand delivered to its receptor via multiple routes. We
      also cloned the newest trefoil peptide, intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), from
      human and rat intestinal mucosa. Using in situ hybridization we demonstrated its 
      synthesis by normal rat intestinal goblet cells. RNAse protection analysis
      revealed that the level of mRNA for rat ITF in small and large intestine was
      affected by the process of enteral feeding. We conclude that trefoil peptides are
      widely distributed in the intestine in human inflammatory bowel disease and are
      of considerable potential functional importance.
