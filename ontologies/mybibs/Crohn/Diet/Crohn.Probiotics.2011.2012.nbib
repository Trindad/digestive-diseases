TI  - Nutrition in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it useful for prevention
      and therapy?
PG  - 983-90
AB  - Countless studies aiming to discover the cause and cure of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) have been conducted over the years world-wide. Food nutrients were 
      believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction
      with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal
      microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with
      controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has
      to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication
      can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent
      long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in
      preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of
      enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease,
      according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of
      administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on
      parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.

TI  - Crohn's disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli adhesion is
      enhanced by exposure to the ubiquitous dietary polysaccharide maltodextrin.
PG  - e52132

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis evidenced by an
      altered microbiome forming thick biofilms on the epithelium. Additionally,
      adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strains are frequently isolated from ileal
      lesions of CD patients indicating a potential role for these strains in disease
      pathogenesis. The composition and characteristics of the host microbiome are
      influenced by environmental factors, particularly diet. Polysaccharides added to 
      food as emulsifiers, stabilizers or bulking agents have been linked to
      bacteria-associated intestinal disorders. The escalating consumption of
      polysaccharides in Western diets parallels an increased incidence of CD during
      the latter 20(th) century. In this study, the effect of a polysaccharide panel on
      adhesiveness of the CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 was analyzed to determine if
      these food additives promote disease-associated bacterial phenotypes.
      Maltodextrin (MDX), a polysaccharide derived from starch hydrolysis, markedly
      enhanced LF82 specific biofilm formation. Biofilm formation of multiple other E. 
      coli strains was also promoted by MDX. MDX-induced E. coli biofilm formation was 
      independent of polysaccharide chain length indicating a requirement for MDX
      metabolism. MDX exposure induced type I pili expression, which was required for
      MDX-enhanced biofilm formation. MDX also increased bacterial adhesion to human
      intestinal epithelial cell monolayers in a mechanism dependent on type 1 pili and
      independent of the cellular receptor CEACAM6, suggesting a novel mechanism of
      epithelial cell adhesion. Analysis of mucosa-associated bacteria from individuals
      with and without CD showed increased prevalence of malX, a gene essential for MDX
      metabolism, uniquely in the ileum of CD patients. These findings demonstrate that
      the ubiquitous dietary component MDX enhances E. coli adhesion and suggests a
      mechanism by which Western diets rich in specific polysaccharides may promote
      dysbiosis of gut microbes and contribute to disease susceptibility.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that
      primarily affects the intestines, resulting in breakage of the intestinal
      barrier, pathological inflammation and nutritional disorders that encompass from 
      trace elements deficiency to severe malnutrition. Nutritional interventions
      either alone or associated to drug therapy may be effective to achieve and
      maintain inflammation remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual food intake as
      quantitative and qualitatively, in CD patients; and describe the effect of a
      supplement containing whey proteins and TGF- on their body composition. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed considering 42 consecutive patients,
      followed in a tertiary center, and by using the 3-day food recall and food intake
      frequency questionnaire. Body composition was assessed previously and 8 weeks
      after supplementation with a diet containing whey proteins and TGF-beta (N = 22).
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Considering carbohydrates and lipids, most patients had
      adequate dietary intake according recommendations. Protein, saturated fat, B12
      vitamin and zinc intakes were higher than the recommended values. The dietary
      fiber, A, D, C and E vitamins, calcium, iron, folate, potassium and sodium
      intakes did not reach the recommended requirements in most patients. Patients
      supplemented with the whey protein and TGF-beta dietary presented a positive
      increment in their lean body mass, when compared to non-supplemented group.
      CONCLUSION: CD patients require nutritional orientation. Whey protein intake
      resulted in significant differences, such as improvement in Lean Body Mass and
      reduction in Fat percentage.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The laparoscopic approach is becoming the gold standard in the
      surgical treatment of primary Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to
      compare laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic resection for primary Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: We conducted a non-randomized, comparative, retrospective
      analysis of a prospective database from 1998 to 2010. The remaining 129 patients 
      were divided into two groups: laparoscopic-assisted group (Group L; n=64) and
      conventional group (Group C; n=65). There were no differences between the two
      groups as regards preoperative patient characteristics. Complications were graded
      according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen
      (90.7%) patients had no complications. Out of 12 patients (9.3%) with
      complications, four (3.1%) had Grade I, six (4.7%) had Grade II and two (1.6%)
      had Grade III. There were no postoperative deaths (Grade V). Operating time was
      longer in Group L compared with Group C (P<0.001). Bowel function returned more
      quickly in the laparoscopic group in terms of return of bowel movements (P=0.018)
      and resumption of a regular diet (P=0.06). The mean length of stay was
      significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (P=0.001). The mean follow-up was
      26 months in Group L versus 34 months in Group C (P=0.06). During follow-up, six 
      patients presented with small bowel obstruction in Group C, which was not
      statistically different from Group L (3 patients) (P=0.25). During the follow-up 
      period, there have been no recurrences of Crohn's disease in the laparoscopic
      group while 11 patients (16.9%) have developed a recurrence in the conventional
      group (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary
      Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most
      cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn's disease should be considered as the
      preferred operative approach for primary resections.

AB  - Maintenance of medically induced remission is a clinical challenge in Crohn's
      disease (CD), since it is a chronic disease and that often occurs in young
      people. The introduction of immunosuppressors and biologics has significantly
      improved the management of these patients, however efficacy and safety of these
      treatments in the very long term still needs clarification. Furthermore,
      scientific research is driven more into new drugs to induce remission rather then
      maintenance.

TI  - A prospective study of pre-illness diet in newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 40-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors, including diet, seem to participate in the
      etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. The kind of dietetic habits before the
      appearance of the illness in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) has not been
      studied extensively. AIM: To prospectively assess the kind of food consumption in
      patients with CD exactly at the time of diagnosis and to identify dietary
      constituents as risk factors for development of CD. PATIENTS - METHODS: Twenty
      eight patients with a newly established diagnosis of CD (2-4 weeks), (12 men and 
      16 women), 30 patients with previously (between 2 - 11 years) established
      diagnosis of CD (14 men and 16 women) and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy
      controls (16 men and 22 women) were included in the study. Dietary intake was
      assessed by means of special questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparisons between controls
      and newly diagnosed patients showed that increased consumption of milk and yogurt
      (P = 0.042), fruits (P = 0.0001), citrus (P = 0.0001), vegetables (P = 0.0001),
      carrots (P = 0.0001), legumes (P = 0.036), fish and selfish (P = 0.001), honey (P
      = 0.003), and nuts (P = 0.038), was associated with decreased risk for CD. On the
      other hand, significantly increased intake of fat (P = 0.041), olive oil (P =
      0.038), margarine (P = 0.038), sugar (P = 0.02), alcohol drinks (P = 0.009),
      fried food (P = 0.0001), and pasta (P = 0.0001), was noticed on recently
      diagnosed patients in comparison with the healthy control group. On logistic
      regression analysis foods remaining statistically significant were: margarine,
      pasta, fried foods, fat, olives, sugar (increased risk), and yogurt, honey,
      fruits, nuts, fish, and citrus fruits (decreased risk). Newly diagnosed patients 
      were significantly overweighed (64%) compared to healthy people (26%) and old
      patients (7%). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in many kinds of food between 
      newly diagnosed patients with CD, patients with established CD and normal people 
      certainly exist. Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be
      associated with higher or lower risks for CD in adults. However, whether these
      dietary factors are important for the development of CD or modulate the effect of
      other environmental factors is unknown.

TI  - Enteral nutrition to suppress postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence: a
      five-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1587-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral
      nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients
      following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to 
      prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty
      consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were
      included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet
      infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). 
      Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction
      (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No
      patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except
      patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence
      requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not
      continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN
      group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence
      requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate
      requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group
      (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the
      control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative
      incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the
      difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this
      study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD
      recurrence.

TI  - Impact of environmental and dietary factors on the course of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 3814-22
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i29.3814 [doi]
AB  - Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted
      to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the
      outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of
      smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its
      influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD,
      active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this
      clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients
      who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit
      in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of
      IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very
      frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general
      dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients
      should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role 
      of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation
      of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem 
      to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil,
      medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a
      therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in
      inactive UC.

PG  - 241-7
LID - 10.4103/1319-3767.98428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at high risk 
      for low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to evaluate BMD in IBD
      patients and its relationship with bone metabolism in a group of Iranian
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients
      with IBD to assess BMD status and serum biochemical factors. After getting the
      demographic data from 200 patients, they were screened using dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck for BMD status. Serum
      levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25-OH vitamin D) were measured to assess the bone metabolism status. RESULTS:
      Two hundred patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. One hundred and eighty 
      three (91.5%) patients were identified as having ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17
      (8.5%) as having Crohn's disease (CD). Based on the lumbar and femoral neck bone 
      mass densitometry, 148 (74.4%) patients had low BMD at either lumbar spine or
      femoral neck. Of these, 100 patients (50.3%) were osteopenic and 48 patients
      (24.1%) were osteoporotic. A 58.6% and 61% of patients with UC had low BMD in the
      lumbar and femoral neck, respectively. These results for those with CD were 76.5%
      and 70.6%, respectively. The mean of femoral neck and lumbar T-scores in patients
      with UC were -1.14 and -1.38, and in patients with CD were -1.24 and -1.47,
      respectively (P > 0.05). The mean (+/-SD) levels for calcium (Ca) in UC and CD
      were in the normal range. The mean (+/-SD) levels of ALP and 25-OH vitamin D in
      both the groups were in the normal range, and in comparison between groups (UC
      and CD), no significant differences were observed (P = 0.20 for ALP and P = 0.44 
      for 25-OH vitamin D). In the assessment of correlation between biochemical
      markers and BMD, an inverse correlation between lumbar T-score and ALP or 25-OH
      vitamin D only in patients with UC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence
      of low BMD in the Iranian population with IBD needs attention. The subclinical
      vitamin D deficiency may contribute to bone loss in IBD patients, which is more
      pronounced in patients with UC in this study because of the small population of
      patients with CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

TI  - Body composition in Indian patients with Crohn's disease during active and
      remission phase.
PG  - 285-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The alterations in the body composition (BC) in both the active and
      remission phase of Crohn's disease (CD) are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To
      assess the BC of the patients with CD in active and remission phase, and compare 
      with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: BC was assessed by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis using Tanita TBF-215 leg to leg portable impedance analyzer in 123
      patients with CD and 100 matched HC. Diet intake was assessed by 24 hours diet
      recall method. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 36.4 +/- 12.6 years and 56% 
      were males. Patients in active phase as well as in remission phase had a lower
      BMI than HC (18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 23.9 +/- 4.0; p = 0.001 and 18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 21.6
      +/- 5.0; p = 0.002). The fat mass (FM) in active phase was significantly lower
      than that in remission phase (8.2 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.4 +/- 10.6 kg; p = 0.005) and HC
      (8.2 +/- 5.9 kg vs. 14.1 +/- 7.5 kg; p = 0.001). FM did not differ between
      remission phase and HC. The fat free mass (FFM) of HC was significantly higher
      than that of both remission phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 43.3 +/- 10.4 kg; p =
      0.001) and active phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 40.7 +/- 8.5 kg; p = 0.001). There
      was no difference in the FFM of patients in both phases; p = 0.356. The intake of
      macronutrients was comparable between the two phases; however lower than that of 
      HC. CONCLUSION: Both FM and FFM were depleted in the active phase, while only FFM
      was deficient in the remission phase of CD, indicating a poor recovery of lean
      mass in remission.

PG  - 29-44
LID - 10.1016/j.trsl.2011.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

TI  - Longer-term outcomes of nutritional management of Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 2171-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2232-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the short-term benefits of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      for induction of remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD) are well
      documented, the longer-term outcomes are less clear. AIM: This retrospective
      study aimed to ascertain the outcomes for up to 24 months following EEN in a
      group of children with CD. METHODS: Children treated with EEN as initial therapy 
      for newly diagnosed CD over a 5-year period were identified. Details of disease
      activity, growth, and drug requirements over the period of follow-up were noted. 
      Outcomes in children managed with EEN were compared to a group of children
      initially treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Over this time period, 31
      children were treated with EEN and 26 with corticosteroids. Twenty-six (84 %) of 
      the 31 children treated with EEN entered remission. Children treated with EEN
      exhibited lower pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) scores at 6
      months (p = 0.02) and received lower cumulative doses of steroids over the study 
      period (p < 0.0001) than the group treated with corticosteroids. Height
      increments over 24 months were greater in the EEN group (p = 0.01). Although the 
      median times to relapse were the same, the EEN group had a lower incidence of
      relapse in each time interval and survival curve analysis showed lower risk of
      relapse (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: EEN lead to multiple benefits beyond the
      initial period of inducing remission for these children, with positive outcomes
      over 2 years from diagnosis. Of particular clinical relevance to growing children
      was the reduced exposure to corticosteroids.

      elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 736-42
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2012.04.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease. Elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition are effective therapies
      for Crohn's disease; however, changes of microbiota as a result of both
      treatments have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To elucidate changes of faecal
      microbiota in Crohn's disease patients treated with elemental diet and total
      parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 33 active
      Crohn's disease patients and 17 healthy subjects, and recollected after elemental
      diet (8 patients) and total parenteral nutrition (9 patients). Terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16srDNA was
      performed to evaluate the whole microbiota. Specific quantitative PCR was then
      used to determine populations of predominant bacterial groups. RESULTS: In
      Crohn's disease patients, the number of terminal restriction fragments, which
      reflects bacterial species, was significantly lower. Populations of total
      bacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly lower and the ratio of
      Enterococcus was higher. The number of terminal restriction fragments was
      significantly decreased after total parenteral nutrition, but not after elemental
      diet. Population of Bacteroides fragilis significantly decreased after elemental 
      diet, while population of Enterococcus significantly increased after total
      parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients
      was markedly different from healthy subjects. Species diversity was reduced by
      total parenteral nutrition, but not by elemental diet.

PG  - 319-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01254.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk
      assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support.
      Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is 
      a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of
      inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition
      screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics
      (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids),
      Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition
      Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease.
      Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health
      Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS:
      There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but
      there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). 
      No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children 
      scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the 
      degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children
      had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high
      risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored
      at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools
      for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential
      to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Advances in inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 257-70
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition that
      burdens the lives of many children around the world. It is characterized by
      chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis
      and IBD-unknown are the three types of this disease. The management of children
      with inflammatory bowel disease is complex and requires skill, knowledge and
      experience with current advances in the field. Over the past several years, there
      have been a number of achievements and progress made in the care and management
      of this disorder. The diagnostic tools have greatly improved. The therapeutic
      armamentarium has expanded. The genetics of IBD has become more detailed and the 
      role of the gut microbiome has been better defined. The evolution of biological
      agents has revolutionized the way we approach this disease. This review
      highlights the recent advances in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and
      provides an overview for clinicians caring for children with this disorder.

TI  - Nutritional therapy versus 6-mercaptopurine as maintenance therapy in patients
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 649-54
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2012.03.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine is often used as maintenance therapy in patients
      with Crohn's disease. However, toxicities like myelosuppression limit its
      clinical benefit. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of elemental diet versus
      6-mercaptopurine as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. METHODS: Ninety-five 
      eligible patients with Crohn's disease activity index </=150 were randomly
      assigned to: 6-mercaptopurine (0.5-1.5mg/kg/day, n=30); Elental as an elemental
      diet (>/=900 kcal/day, n=32); none (control, n=33). In the three groups, patients
      were and remained on 5-aminosalicylic acid (2250-3000 mg/day). Patients were
      observed for 2 years and the rate of relapse (Crohn's disease activity index
      >/=200) was monitored. RESULTS: At 24 months, the fractions of patients who had
      maintained remission were 60%, 46.9% and 27.2% for 6-mercaptopurine, Elental and 
      the control groups, respectively. Log-rank test showed better efficacy for
      6-mercaptopurine (P=0.0041) and Elental (P=0.0348) versus control. No significant
      difference was found between 6-mercaptopurine and Elental. Further, in the
      6-mercaptopurine group, 2 patients experienced liver injury and one developed
      alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: This 24 months comparison study showed that Elental as
      maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease patients was as effective as
      6-mercaptopurine. Elental should be useful for long-term maintenance therapy in
      Crohn's disease. This is the first comparison study evaluating nutritional
      therapy versus 6-mercaptopurine.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can
      affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune
      processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves
      some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children,
      in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with
      similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody
      stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed 
      during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in
      these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be
      especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As
      such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating
      patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a 
      variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved
      endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis 
      and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of
      complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for
      practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks
      and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and
      especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not
      geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the
      management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to
      educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for
      children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans
      between primary care and subspecialty providers.

TI  - The effects of provocation by foods with raised IgG antibodies and additives on
      the course of Crohn's disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 19-27
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study was designed to assess the role of foods with raised 
      IgG antibodies and additives on the symptoms and inflammation of Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: Eight patients with Crohn's disease in remission were studied. They
      followed a strict diet during phase I. Then, provocations with two, three-day
      periods (phases II and III) followed: in phase II, pure forms of foods with high 
      IgG antibodies and in phase III, off-the-shelf forms of those foods were added.
      Stool samples were collected for fecal calprotectin assay. Blood samples were
      taken on the 11th and 17th days for highly sensitive C-reactive protein,
      ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, and platelets.
      Patients kept a diet-symptom diary. RESULTS: Increased Crohn's disease activity
      index scores were found statistically significant (p=0.012) between pre- and
      during the provocation weeks. There were significant increases according to
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index when the highest values during the phases I, II (p=0.027)
      and I, III (p=0.027) were compared. The increases in highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein (p=0.025) and white blood cells (p= 0.036) were found statistically
      significant. Fecal calprotectin levels showed day-to-day variability. When
      compared, the levels of fecal calprotectin increased in all patients on the last 
      day of the restriction (10th day) and the first day of the provocation (11th day)
      with the exception of one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Foods with raised IgG antibody
      levels and food additives can provoke the symptoms and may stimulate the
      inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease. Addition of a proper diet with
      restriction of those foods may be beneficial in the medical treatment.

PG  - 1266-80
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2012.07150.x [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lower in Asia than in the West.
      However, across Asia the incidence and prevalence of IBD has increased rapidly
      over the last two to four decades. These changes may relate to increased contact 
      with the West, westernization of diet, increasing antibiotics use, improved
      hygiene, vaccinations, or changes in the gut microbiota. Genetic factors also
      differ between Asians and the Caucasians. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, 
      although CD incidence is rapidly increasing in certain areas. There is a male
      predominance of CD in Asia, but a trend towards equal sex distribution for UC.
      IBD is diagnosed at a slightly older age than in the West, and there is rarely a 
      second incidence peak as in the West. A positive family history is much less
      common than in the West, as are extra-intestinal disease manifestations. There
      are clear ethnic differences in incidence within countries in Asia, and an
      increased incidence in IBD in migrants from Asia to the West. Research in Asia,
      an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead to the discovery of
      critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of IBD.

      diseases.

LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100630 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both
      genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of
      involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the
      probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various 
      environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut
      microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission,
      reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease
      is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback
      provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput
      genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are
      modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is 
      transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of
      thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers
      generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure
      the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods
      have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time 
      is right to move them to human studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physical activity is important for muscle and bone strength 
      in the growing child and may be impaired in paediatric patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) even during quiescent disease. The SenseWearPro(2) armband
      allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS:
      Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in 
      remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39
      healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI),
      lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related
      Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to
      record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality 
      of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy 
      intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and
      pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed
      lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34])
      and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards
      lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of
      physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients
      with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between
      patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass
      and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity 
      may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anaemia and iron deficiency are common in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) however it is not known if the prevalence of
      anaemia and iron deficiency alters following diagnosis. METHODS: Laboratory
      results from diagnosis, and at follow up one and two years later were recorded
      retrospectively in children with IBD recruited from a tertiary centre. Anaemia
      was defined using WHO standards and iron deficiency defined using published
      guidelines. RESULTS: 46 children (16 girls) with Crohn's disease and 34 children 
      (18 girls) with UC were studied. 75% of children with IBD were anaemic at
      diagnosis, 30% were anaemic at follow up two years later. 90% of children with
      Crohn's and 95% of children with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) were iron deficient at
      diagnosis. At follow up two years later 70% of children with Crohn's and 65% of
      children with UC were iron deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent anaemia and iron
      deficiency are common in childhood IBD, prevalence alters with duration of time
      from diagnosis.

AB  - Although the use of CAM in pediatric CD is common, quality evidence-based
      research is limited. There is clearly a need for further randomized controlled
      trials. The role of psychosocial distress in children with CD should not be
      overlooked and thus biobehavioral techniques should be considered and
      incorporated when possible. Considering the potential for growth failure and need
      for surgical intervention in CD, any CAM therapies that are not harmful should be
      used only in combination with conventional medical treatment. The importance of
      all health care providers partnering with their patients and asking about CAM
      use, as well as maintaining an awareness of efficacy, safety, harm,
      drug-supplement interactions, and appropriate referral sources, should be kept in
      mind when caring for those afflicted with this chronic disease.

      diseases (CCFA Partners): methodology and initial results.
PG  - 2099-106
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The widespread use of the Internet allows for unique research
      opportunities. We aimed to develop and follow an Internet-based cohort (e-cohort)
      of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over time.
      METHODS: We established an e-cohort of adults with IBD (CCFA Partners) by
      recruiting through Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) email
      rosters, CCFA Website promotion, social media, and other publicity mechanisms.
      The baseline survey included modules on disease course and activity, diet and
      exercise, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Baseline characteristics of the
      cohort are summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 7819
      adults with IBD joined CCFA Partners through August, 2011. The median age was 42 
      years (interquartile range [IQR] 30-54), 5074 (72.3%) were female. A total of
      4933 (63.1%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 2675 (34.2%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 
      and 211 (2.7%) had IBD unspecified. For CD, the mean short CD Activity Index
      (CDAI) was 151.9 (standard deviation [SD] 106.4), with 2274 (59.4%) in remission.
      For UC, the mean simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) was 3.6 (SD 2.8),
      with 937 (42.9%) in remission. The mean short IBD questionnaire (SIBDQ) score was
      48.7 (SD 11.8). SIBDQ was inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). 
      The mean Morisky medication adherence score (MMAS) was 5.7 (SD 2.0). MMAS scores 
      were inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CCFA
      Partners is a novel e-cohort. Enrollment is ongoing, with surveys twice yearly.
      CCFA Partners represents a unique resource to study PROs and changes in disease
      management over time.

      ofantimicrobial drugs in the last fifty years. The rational therapy is based to
      use the drugs with high anti-inflammatory efficacy. The choice of therapy is
      driven due to disease course in individual patient. The integral part of patients
      follow up are activities directing to minimize of drug's side effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Environmental factors may play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of IBD. The history of patients of the German IBD twin study was
      analyzed by questionnaires and interviews. METHODS: Randomly selected German
      monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with at least one sibling suffering
      from IBD (n=512) were characterized in detail including demography, medical
      history and concomitant medications. Controls comprised of non-twin IBD patients 
      (n=392) and healthy subjects (n=207). RESULTS: The most significant variables
      that were associated with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC)
      included living abroad before time of diagnosis (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.57-13.69),
      high frequency of antibiotic use (MZ CD OR, 5.03; 95% CI 1.61-17.74, DZ CD OR,
      7.66; 95% CI, 3.63-16.82, MZ UC OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.45-10.56, DZ UC OR, 3.08; CI,
      1.63-5.92), high consumption of processed meat including sausage (MZ CD OR, 7.9; 
      95% CI, 2.15-38.12, DZ CD OR, 10.75; 95% CI, 4.82-25.55, MZ UC OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 
      1.89-19.48, DZ UC OR, 18.11; 95% CI, 7.34-50.85), and recall of bacterial
      gastrointestinal infections (MZ CD OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.33-77.14, DZ CD OR, 17.21;
      95% CI, 4.47-112.5, MZ UC OR, 5.87; 95% CI, 1.61-28.0, DZ UC OR, 11.34; 95% CI,
      4.81-29.67). CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforced the association of life style
      events, in particular a specific dietary and infections history, with IBD.
      Alteration of gut flora or alterations of the mucosal immune system in reactivity
      to the flora could be an important factor to explain the relationship between
      life-style and disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Differing protocols have been utilized in published studies evaluating
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in the management of active pediatric Crohn's
      disease. This study aimed to ascertain the protocols currently utilized in
      different pediatric centers around the world and to highlight their similarities 
      and differences. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated to individuals at
      pediatric centers in countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.
      Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at
      their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used
      for administering EEN to these children. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35
      separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks
      to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas 
      were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings
      were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with 
      the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The
      reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common
      recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual
      introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%). CONCLUSIONS:
      This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols
      used in different areas of the world. The development of consistent protocols may
      enhance the acceptance, efficacy and wider utilization of this therapy.

TI  - [Development of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis in a patient with Crohn's
      disease receiving infliximab despite of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid].
PG  - 879-82
AB  - We herein report a case of a 41-year-old female with a 14-year history of Crohn's
      disease who had been treated with diet and mesalazine. Because of inadequate
      control, therapy with infliximab was planned. She had a positive result on the
      interferon-gamma release assay (QuantiFERON TB). After active tuberculosis was
      ruled out by chest x-ray and computed tomography, she was started on a six-month 
      course of isoniazid 7 weeks prior to starting infliximab. After 10 doses of
      infliximab (15 months of therapy), she presented with pain of cervical
      lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the lymph nodes revealed Langhans giant cells from
      granulomas and a positive result of polylmerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. The treatment with infliximab was discontinued and
      anti-tuberculosis therapy was started. Although treatment for latent tuberculosis
      infection lowers the risk of reactivation of tuberculosis due to tumor necrosis
      factor alpha-blockers, it cannot completely inactivate tuberculosis. Despite the 
      completion of chemoprophylaxis, patients receiving such agents should be
      instructed to watch out for any symptoms associated with pulmonary and
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis such as fever, cough, malaise, body weight loss,
      night sweating and lymphadenopathy, and they should also be closely followed up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The increasing incidence of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is well
      known in Western countries in the last two decades. This study was conducted to
      delineate the trends of incidence during this period and clinical patterns of
      pediatric CD in Taiwan. METHODS: All children admitted to National Taiwan
      University Hospital between 1990 and 2009 who met the Porto Criteria for CD were 
      included. Annual enrollment and clinical characteristics were retrospectively
      reviewed. The incidence was calculated by dividing the number of index cases by
      total hospitalized pediatric cases to minimize the bias caused by the growing
      number of hospitalized patients there. We quoted data and statistics from the
      Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, and Accounting and Statistics,
      Executive Yuan, Taiwan, to present the social-economic changes in Taiwan in the
      recent decades. RESULTS: The cumulative hospital-based incidence of CD rose from 
      13.2 per 100,000 to 25.4 per 100,000 children admitted to this hospital in the
      past two decades. The median age of diagnosis in the first decade of this study
      was less than that of the second decade. The other study parameters, including
      gender, disease activity at diagnosis, duration from disease onset to diagnosis, 
      anatomic location and disease behavior, and symptoms at diagnosis, were not
      different. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the hospital-based incidence of
      pediatric CD has been increasing in Taiwan in recent decades. Factors
      contributing to such an increase could be physicians' awareness of the disease,
      easier access to health care, and environmental factors.

AB  - Enteric granulomatous inflammation can be caused by a number of conditions
      including Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, enteric infections, chronic granulomatous
      disease and also by drug reactions. Granulomas have also been described in
      microscopic colitis associated with certain medications and autoimmune diseases. 
      The association of granulomatous ileocolitis with coeliac disease is not common. 
      We present a case of coeliac disease with granulomatous ileocolitis with
      follow-up and repeat histology on a gluten-free diet. We discuss the pathological
      mechanisms leading to the association of granulomatous ileocolitis with coeliac
      disease as well as other conditions.

PG  - 264-9
LID - 10.1007/s12664-011-0145-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) in India is
      increasing. This case-control study was designed to detect associations of
      environmental and dietary factors with the diagnosis of CD. METHODS: In 200
      consecutive patients with CD and 200 control subjects without gastrointestinal
      disease, environmental hygiene exposures in childhood and in the past one year,
      and dietary preferences were recorded using a questionnaire. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were done. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, CD showed
      positive association with urban residence (at birth and current), availability of
      protected drinking water (childhood and current), availability of piped water in 
      the house (childhood and current), and strict vegetarian dietary habit, and
      negative association with regular fish consumption and presence of cattle in the 
      house compound. Multivariate analysis showed that regular fish consumption (OR
      0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.80, p = 0.003), and presence of cattle in the house compound 
      currently (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92, p = 0.023) were significant protective
      associations, whereas use of safe drinking water was positively associated (OR
      1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.47, p = 0.042) with the disease. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of CD
      was associated with dietary and environmental exposures, which indicate that diet
      and hygiene may influence the development of this disease.

TI  - Higher predicted vitamin D status is associated with reduced risk of Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 482-9
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.11.040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vitamin D influences innate immunity, which is believed to be 
      involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
      However, data examining vitamin D status in relation to risk of CD and UC are
      lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 72,719 women (age,
      40-73 y) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. In 1986, women completed an
      assessment of diet and lifestyle, from which a 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D]
      prediction score was developed and validated against directly measured levels of 
      plasma 25(OH)D. Through 2008, we confirmed reported diagnoses of incident CD or
      UC through medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to
      examine the hazard ratio (HR) for incident CD or UC after adjusting for potential
      confounders. RESULTS: During 1,492,811 person-years of follow-up evaluation, we
      documented 122 incident cases of CD and 123 cases of UC. The median predicted
      25(OH)D level was 22.3 ng/mL in the lowest and 32.2 ng/mL in the highest
      quartiles. Compared with the lowest quartile, the multivariate-adjusted HR
      associated with the highest quartile of vitamin D was 0.54 (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.30-.99) for CD (P(trend) = .02) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.34-1.25) for
      UC (P(trend) = .17). Compared with women with a predicted 25(OH)D level less than
      20 ng/mL, the multivariate-adjusted HR was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.97) for CD and
      0.57 (95% CI, 0.19-1.70) for UC for women with a predicted 25(OH)D level greater 
      than 30 ng/mL. There was a significant inverse association between dietary and
      supplemental vitamin D and UC, and a nonsignificant reduction in CD risk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher predicted plasma levels of 25(OH)D significantly reduce the
      risk for incident CD and nonsignificantly reduce the risk for UC in women.

TI  - Effects of recombinant human growth hormone on protein turnover in the fasting
      and fed state in adolescents with Crohn disease.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to test whether recombinant human growth
      hormone (rhGH) supplementation would enhance protein synthesis and accretion of
      lean body mass. Eight adolescents (six males and two females; 17.2 +/- 2.6 years;
      age range, 13.7-21.2 years) participated in a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over trial of rhGH. We employed stable isotopes to
      measure proteolysis and protein synthesis during fasting and fed conditions
      during two 6-month treatment conditions. We also measured bone mineral density
      (BMD), markers of bone turnover, and body composition. Whole-body proteolysis,
      phenylalanine catabolism, and protein synthesis did not differ during treatment
      with rhGH vs. placebo. Enteral nutrition suppressed proteolysis and increased
      protein synthesis similarly during placebo and rhGH treatments. We conclude that 
      rhGH is unlikely to provide sufficient metabolic benefit to warrant its use as an
      adjunct treatment in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn disease. A high
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and suboptimal BMD existed, which deserves
      further investigation and clinical attention.

      micronutrients in plasma and erythrocytes of children with active Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1672-81
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21916 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is the primary treatment for active pediatric
      Crohn's disease (CD) in the UK/Europe, improving disease activity and
      anthropometry. This study assessed changes in micronutrient status during
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Seventeen children (male/female: 8/9;
      median age: 12.7 years) with active CD were treated exclusively for 6-8 weeks on 
      a polymeric feed (Modulen IBD; Nestle, UK). Body impedance was measured at
      baseline, during EEN, and posttreatment on normal diet and converted to z-scores 
      of fat and lean mass. Blood samples for nutrient analysis were collected from 13 
      children at baseline, end of EEN, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Lean but not fat
      mass improved at the end of EEN (initiation vs. end of EEN; fat mass [z-score]:
      -0.5 vs. -0.3; P = 0.141; lean mass [z-score]: -2.1 vs. -0.8; P < 0.0001). At
      baseline several children presented with suboptimal concentrations of
      carotenoids, trace elements, vitamin C, B6, and folate in plasma but not in
      erythrocytes. EEN improved concentrations for several nutrients, but more than
      90% of patients had depleted concentrations of all carotenoids. The latter
      improved on normal diet but other micronutrients, which improved during EEN,
      returned toward pretreatment concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Lean but not fat mass
      improved at the end of EEN. Median concentrations for several plasma
      micronutrients improved on EEN but carotenoids were depleted. These findings may 
      have implications for clinical practice and producers of enteral feeds. As plasma
      concentrations for many micronutrients can be affected by the acute phase
      response, measurements in erythrocytes may be a better marker of actual body
      stores.

PG  - 1585-8
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0b013e3182315556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-port laparoscopic surgery has been described for various
      colorectal conditions. Here, we report the first 4 single-port laparoscopic
      sigmoid colostomies for fecal diversion. METHODS: A 1.5-cm-round incision was
      made on the skin at a previously marked colostomy site. A wound retractor was
      inserted and an access platform with four 5-mm trocars was attached to the wound 
      retractor. The sigmoid colon was mobilized using electrocautery, laparoscopic
      scissors, or an advanced bipolar device. A standard Brooke colostomy was created 
      through the initial skin incision. RESULTS: Four elective single-port
      laparoscopic diverting colostomies were performed. Indications included
      obstructing colon and rectal cancers and intractable Crohn's proctitis. The
      average operative time was 73 minutes (range, 53-105), and blood loss was minimal
      (<50 mL). There were no intraoperative complications. Three of 4 patients
      received oral analgesia, and one patient received patient-controlled intravenous 
      analgesia postoperatively. The average time to passage of flatus was 1 day. Diet 
      was advanced either on the day of surgery or on postoperative day 1. The length
      of hospital stay ranged from 0 to 15 days. CONCLUSION: Single-port laparoscopic
      sigmoid colostomy is an effective technique that allows full intra-abdominal
      visualization and colonic mobilization while eliminating the need for additional 
      skin incisions other than the colostomy site itself.

LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to
      inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and
      its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library
      were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition,
      smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are
      encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts,
      mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from
      meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of
      ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No
      effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total
      energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative
      colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits,
      vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate).
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated
      with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in
      other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended
      in high risk subjects.

AB  - Recent data developing from the study of postinfectious IBS has challenged the
      belief that IBS is a purely psychological disorder. Distinct abnormalities of the
      gut mucosa have been reported including immune activation and increased release
      of inflammatory mediators with some overlap with IBD. New studies show that
      genetic factors which predispose to IBD are also associated with IBS. A common
      feature is impaired gut barrier function which appears to precede the development
      of IBD while in IBS it may be the result of either a preceding infection or
      psychosocial stress. Stress can activate mast cells which are a feature in most
      but not all IBS series. Anti-inflammatory treatments targeting activated mast
      cells may benefit IBS patients but currently the evidence is weak and larger
      trials are needed. Changes in the commensal microbiota have been recently
      described with a "dysbiosis" in CD characterised by reduced diversity.
      Inconsistent changes have also been described in IBS but studies controlling for 
      antibiotic use and differences in diet and bowel habit are needed before
      definitive conclusions can be made.

TI  - Early experience with single-site laparoscopic surgery for complicated ileocolic 
      Crohn's disease at a tertiary-referral center.
PG  - 777-82

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of single-site laparoscopy (SSL) for the treatment of
      ileocolic Crohn's disease complicated by an abscess, a phlegmon, or fistulizing
      disease has not been thoroughly assessed. METHODS: A prospectively maintained
      database of SSL surgeries performed between October 2010 and March 2011 was
      reviewed. Consecutive patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease complicated by a
      paracolic abscess, a phlegmon, or a fistula were included for analysis. Data
      recorded included demographic information, body mass index (BMI), estimated blood
      loss (EBL), length of surgery, rate of conversion to standard laparoscopic
      surgery or open surgery, length of hospital stay, and rate of complications.
      RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. Complications from Crohn's
      disease included four (66%) patients who developed a paracolic abscess that
      required drainage upon admission, one (16%) patient who developed a phlegmon, and
      one (16%) patient who developed an enterocutaneous fistula. Mean age of the study
      population was 25 years, with a mean BMI of 21 and a mean ASA score of 3. Five
      (83%) of the patients were immunosuppressed with high-dose steroids. Mean
      operative time was 160 min, with a median EBL of 60 mL. One patient required the 
      insertion of an additional trocar, whereas there were no conversions to
      laparotomy. Four (66%) patients required diversion with a loop ileostomy. Median 
      time to flatus was 1 day. All patients tolerated a diet on the day of surgery,
      with a median length of stay of 3 days. There were no deaths and no complications
      related to bleeding, organ injury, surgical site infections, or anastomotic
      leaks. CONCLUSIONS: A single-site laparoscopic approach for complicated ileocolic
      Crohn's disease can be performed safely, with short lengths of hospital stay and 
      with a low rate of complications. A multicenter study would be beneficial to
      validate these findings.

TI  - Gut-mediated and HLA-B27-associated arthritis: an emphasis on ankylosing
      spondylitis and Crohn's disease with a proposal for the use of new treatment.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn's disease (CD), especially when associated 
      with spondylitis are interrelated conditions included within the categories of
      spondyloarthropathic disease entities. They share some common clinical, genetic, 
      and microbiological findings. An extensive amount of studies which have been
      carried out by various independent groups throughout the world have shown that
      Klebsiella pneumoniae microorganisms could be suggested as the most likely
      etiopathogenetic triggers for AS and CD based on the molecular mimicry mechanism 
      and the existence of the evidence for immunological, microbiological, and
      molecular link between Klebsiella and self antigens. It is proposed that the use 
      of low starch diet in conjunction with the currently used treatment might help in
      the eradication of Klebsiella microbes from the bowel and could result in the
      stoppage and alleviation of the disease process in patients with AS and/or CD.

TI  - No relation between disease activity measured by multiple methods and REE in
      childhood Crohn disease.
PG  - 271-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318236b19a [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increased resting energy expenditure (REE) unmatched by
      dietary intake is implicated as a cause of poor nutrition in childhood
      inflammatory conditions. Adequate description of disease activity and correction 
      of REE data for body composition are important to reach reliable conclusions
      about changes in REE associated with disease. The present study aimed to
      determine the effect of disease activity measured by clinical status, systemic
      and stool inflammatory markers on REE in children with Crohn disease using
      appropriate correction for confounding factors. METHODS: Sixty children with
      Crohn disease were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit
      and studied on 1 occasion. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Fat-free
      mass (FFM) was estimated by skinfold thickness. Disease activity was measured
      using systemic (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR])
      and faecal markers of inflammation (lactoferrin, calprotectin) and clinical
      scores (Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index). RESULTS: Using a multiple
      regression model, there was no significant change in REE from active or inactive 
      disease (beta = 0.03, P = 0.7) nor from CRP (beta = -0.05, P = 0.52), ESR (beta =
      -0.07, P = 0.43), faecal calprotectin (beta = -0.07, P = 0.38), and faecal
      lactoferrin (beta = 0.01, P = 0.88). REE/kg FFM was not associated with the
      Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (r = 0.1, P = 0.44), CRP (r = -0.3, P =
      0.84) or ESR (r = 0.12, P = 0.4), faecal calprotectin (r = 0.04, P = 0.97), or
      faecal lactoferrin (r = 0.02, P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: REE corrected for
      physiologically relevant confounders is not associated with degree of disease
      activity using clinical tools or systemic and local inflammatory markers, and
      therefore is an unlikely mechanism for poor nutritional state.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 571-80
LID - 10.1177/0148607111413599 [doi]
AB  - The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively
      unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent
      and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First
      principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut
      whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with 
      short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors 
      the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of
      active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are
      accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple
      polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient
      evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the
      maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN
      reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in
      support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute
      flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the
      evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better 
      those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.

TI  - Effects of dairy products on crohn's disease symptoms are influenced by fat
      content and disease location but not lactose content or disease activity status
      in a New Zealand population.
PG  - 1165-72
LID - 10.1016/j.jada.2011.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products have been perceived as having the potential to cause
      adverse effects in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) and are often avoided,
      potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis and related morbidity associated 
      with inadequate dietary calcium intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the self-reported 
      effects of dairy products on CD symptoms and to determine whether these effects
      differed between types of dairy products consumed and disease state or location. 
      DESIGN: Secondary analysis of dietary survey and clinical data from participants 
      in the Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Disease study based in Auckland, New 
      Zealand. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred and sixty-five men and women diagnosed
      with CD for which both dietary survey data and clinical information were
      available. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: chi(2) analysis was conducted to
      assess whether significant differences in the proportions of responses relating
      to a worsening of CD symptoms from individual dairy products were evident between
      individuals with active or quiescent CD, or ileal or colonic disease locations.
      Odds ratios with confidence interval were calculated to determine whether CD
      location was associated with risk of any type of adverse reaction to milk
      products. Logit scales were utilized to depict self-reported CD symptoms
      associated with individual dairy product consumption for ileal and colonic CD
      patients. RESULTS: Dairy products had no effect on self-reported CD symptoms for 
      most people. Dairy products with a high fat content were most frequently reported
      to worsen perceived CD symptoms. Clinically, self-reported CD activity status did
      not influence responses to dairy products; however, colonic inflammation was more
      frequently associated with adverse CD effects in comparison to ileal CD
      involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Research outcomes question the necessity of dairy
      product avoidance in CD patients and illustrate the highly individual nature of
      dairy product tolerance in this clinical population.

      IBD.
PG  - 150-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182144c74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of
      treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however,
      its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study
      was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and
      adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents 
      with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 
      healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at 
      the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in
      controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the
      baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P
      < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05).
      During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased
      in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease
      remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD
      during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1
      concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group
      (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving
      remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor
      production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which
      possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.

TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often question their doctors about
      diet. The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing
      dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical
      societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD;
      listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and
      creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the
      existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from
      sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding 
      foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals,
      drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral
      supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat,
      reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice 
      exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease
      patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.

TI  - Can capsule endoscopy be used as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of
      nonbleeding indications in daily clinical practice? A prospective study.
PG  - 362-7
LID - 10.1159/000324548 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy (CE) and its
      impact on treatment and outcome in patients without bleeding indications.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five nonbleeding patients were
      enrolled in the study. The most common indications for CE were chronic abdominal 
      pain alone (33 patients) or combined with chronic diarrhea (31 patients) and
      chronic diarrhea alone (30 patients). Among the 165 patients, 129 underwent CE
      for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms and 36 for surveillance or disease
      staging. RESULTS: CE findings were positive, suspicious and negative in 73
      (44.2%), 13 (7.9%) and 79 (47.9%) of cases, respectively. The diagnostic yield
      was highest in patients with refractory celiac disease (10/10, 100%) and
      suspected Crohn's disease (5/6, 83.3%), followed by patients with chronic
      abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea (13/31, 41.9%), established Crohn's disease
      (2/6, 33.3%), chronic diarrhea alone (8/30, 26.7%), chronic abdominal pain alone 
      (8/33, 24.2%) and other indications (3/13, 23.1%) (p < 0.005). The CE findings
      led to a change of medication in 74 (47.7%) patients, surgery in 15 (9.7%),
      administration of a strict gluten-free or other special diet in 13 (8.4%) and had
      other consequences in 11 (6.7%). Management was not modified in 42 (27.1%)
      patients. Among symptomatic patients (n = 129), 29 (22.5%) were lost to
      follow-up. The remaining 100 patients were followed up for 8.7 +/- 4.0 months
      (range 2-19). Among the latter, resolution or improvement of symptoms was
      observed in 86 (86%) patients, no change in 11 (11%) and 3 (3%) died. All 86
      patients who experienced resolution or improvement of their symptoms had a
      modification of their management after CE; only 7/11 patients whose symptoms did 
      not change (63.6%) and 2/3 patients who died (66.7%) had a modification of
      management (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CE appears to be a useful tool in the
      evaluation of patients with nonbleeding indications. The outcome of most patients
      with negative findings was excellent.

      disease.
PG  - 313-26

AB  - Disease-associated undernutrition of all types is very common in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent weight loss remains one of the triad of 
      clinical manifestations and a cornerstone for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease
      (CD), although significantly fewer patients now present as being underweight.
      Recent evidence suggests that the introduction of medical treatment will quickly 
      restore body weight, although this does not reflect concomitant changes in body
      composition. CD children present with features of nutritional cachexia with
      normal fat stores but depleted lean mass. Poor bone health, delayed puberty and
      growth failure are additional features that further complicate clinical
      management. Suboptimal nutritional intake is a main determinant of
      undernutrition, although activation of the immune system and secretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines exert additional independent effects. Biochemically
      low concentrations of plasma micronutrients are commonly reported in IBD
      patients, although their interpretation is difficult in the presence of an acute 
      phase response and other indices of body stores adequacy are needed. Anaemia is a
      common extraintestinal manifestation of the IBD child. Iron-deficient anaemia is 
      the predominant type, with anaemia of chronic disease second. Decreased dietary
      intake, as a result of decreased appetite and food aversion, is the major cause
      of undernutrition in paediatric IBD. Altered energy and nutrient requirements,
      malabsorption and increased gastrointestinal losses are additional factors,
      although their contribution to undernutrition in paediatric CD needs to be
      studied further.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder resulting from an
      inappropriate innate and acquired immune response to commensal microorganisms in 
      genetically susceptible individuals. This disease has a fluctuating course, with 
      alternating periods of remission and relapses, and it is characterized by a
      remarkable clinical heterogeneity; it may be complicated by perianal fistulas,
      abscesses, and intestinal strictures leading to obstructions, besides several
      systemic manifestations. However, a complete resolution of the disease is
      currently not possible, yet Crohn's disease can be managed with established and
      novel therapies, which achieve long-term remission and acceptable quality of
      life. This review is focused on novel advances in basic and clinical aspects of
      Crohn's disease, although it also deals with new trends in diagnosis and
      treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal
      tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs 
      in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is
      unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition,
      environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted 
      a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What
      are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's 
      disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain
      remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of
      surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's
      disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in
      adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What
      are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with
      Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other
      important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety
      of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics,
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral
      nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental
      colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

TI  - The efficacy of exclusive nutritional therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease,
      comparing fractionated oral vs. continuous enteral feeding.
PG  - 1332-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04662.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy has an established role as induction therapy in
      paediatric Crohn's disease. However, compliance is the main difficulty and may be
      greatly influenced by the administration route. AIM: To analyse the efficiency of
      exclusive nutrition to induce remission in children with Crohn's disease
      comparing fractionated oral vs. continuous enteral feeding. METHODS: The medical 
      records of 106 patients treated by exclusive nutritional therapy [Modulen IBD
      (R)] by either oral or continuous enteral route were reviewed retrospectively.
      Comparative analyses of remission rates, changes in anthropometry, Paediatric
      Crohn's disease Activity Index (PCDAI), laboratory indices and compliance rates
      were performed. RESULTS: On exclusive enteral nutrition, at 8 weeks, 34/45
      patients achieved remission in the oral group (75% on intention-to-treat
      analysis) and 52/61 (85%) in the enteral nutrition group (P = 0.157). All
      patients showed a significant decrease in disease severity assessed by PCDAI (P <
      0.0001) and significant improvements in anthropometric measures and inflammatory 
      indices. No difference was observed whether Modulen IBD was administered orally
      or by continuous enteral feeding, apart from weight gain, which was greater in
      the enteral group (P = 0.041). In a subgroup of patients, mucosal healing was
      evidenced on follow-up endoscopies showing a clear correlation to remission.
      Compliance rates (87% and 90%) were similar. Nevertheless, noncompliant patients 
      had lower mucosal healing and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: These retrospective
      data suggest that the use of fractionated oral nutritional therapy might be as
      efficacious as continuous enteral administration to induce remission and mucosal 
      healing in children with Crohn's disease. However, appropriate prospective
      clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Dietary intake and risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic
      review of the literature.
PG  - 563-73
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.44 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing.
      Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein
      but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although
      many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has 
      been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using
      guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness
      intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits,
      vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies
      were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and 
      manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD 
      patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) 
      and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high
      intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and
      disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a
      negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk.
      High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were
      associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated
      with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats,
      PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD
      and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and 
      high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.

LID - 10.1089/lap.2010.0438 [doi]
AB  - Operative approach for right colectomy has progressed substantially in last
      decades, by the application of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery. Single-port
      (SP) laparoscopic surgery is one of the newest branches of advanced laparoscopy. 
      A 29-year-old woman with ileocecal Crohn's disease underwent a totally
      laparoscopic transumbilical SP right colectomy, assisted by vaginal access. The
      operation time was 140 minutes. The blood loss was 20 mL. The patient was allowed
      to drink fluids and a soft oral diet on the first day postoperatively. Neither
      intraoperative nor postoperative complications were observed. The patient was
      discharged on postoperative day 4. The wound size was 2.5 cm. The umbilical scar 
      was almost invisible on postoperative day 7. Totally laparoscopic transumbilical 
      SP right colectomy with vaginal access is a feasible procedure, providing a
      scarless surgery, ensuring the preservation of the body image.

TI  - Laparoscopic versus Open surgery for small bowel Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD006956
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006956.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that
      most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon (55 percent). Surgical
      treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients. Multiple
      procedures and repeat operations are required in 30 - 70 percent of all patients 
      (Duepree 2002) but the disease remains incurable.Laparoscopy has gained wide
      acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return
      to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain,
      better cosmesis (Duepree 2002, Dunker 1998, Milsom 2001, Reissman 1996), improved
      social and sexual interaction (Albaz 2000) and its use is accepted in benign and 
      malignant colorectal diseases. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage
      of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate
      of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (Albaz 2000) compared with conventional
      surgery reducing the need for non-disease-related surgical procedures in CD
      population.There are concerns about missing occult segments of disease and
      critical proximal strictures due to limited tactile ability, earlier recurrence
      due to possible reduced immune response induced by laparoscopy, technical
      difficulty due to fragile inflamed bowel and mesentery and the existence of
      adhesions, fistulas, and abscesses (Uchikoshi 2004). It is therefore important to
      evaluate the potential benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery versus open
      surgery in patients with small bowel CD (Lowney 2005). OBJECTIVES: To determine
      if there is a difference in the perioperative outcomes and re-operation rates for
      disease recurrence following laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery in
      small bowel CD. SEARCH STRATEGY: Published and unpublished randomised controlled 
      trials were searched for in the following electronic databases: The Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010 issue 2 The Cochrane
      Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects
      (DARE) 2010 issue 2 The Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Controlled Trials
      Register Ovid MEDLINE (1990 to 2010) EMBASE (1990 to 2010) Health Technology
      Assessment (HTA) Database (1990 to 2010) SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
      controlled trials (RCT) comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel
      CD were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently
      assessed the studies and extracted data. RevMan 5.0 was used for statistical
      analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for
      small bowel CD were identified. Long term outcomes of the patients in both the
      trials were published separately and these were included in the
      review.Laparoscopic surgery appeared to be associated with reduced number of
      wound infections (1/61 vs 9/59), reoperation rates for non disease related
      complications (3/57 vs 7/54 ) but the difference was not statistically
      significant [p values were 0.23 and 0.19 respectively]. There was no
      statistically significant difference between any of the compared outcomes between
      laparoscopic and open surgery in the management of small bowel CD. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery for small bowel CD may be as safe as the open
      operation. There was no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and 
      the long term reoperation rates for disease-related or non-disease related
      complications of CD.

      disease.
PG  - 13-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.07.021 [doi]
AB  - Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is defined as a "state of nutrition in which a 
      deficiency or excess (or imbalance) of energy, protein, and other nutrients
      causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and
      composition) and function, and clinical outcome". Although this definition
      resulted from a long discussion among experts, it lacks concise assessment
      criteria. Essential to an effective practice of nutrition support, however, is
      the ability to identify who actually needs medical nutrition therapy. Patients
      with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are a high risk group for
      protein-energy malnutrition, with a prevalence ranging up to 75%.

TI  - Physician attitudes and practices of enteral nutrition as primary treatment of
      paediatric Crohn disease in North America.
PG  - 38-42
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181e2c724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in children with Crohn
      disease has not been universally adopted by North American paediatric
      gastroenterologists. This is in stark contrast to their European counterparts.
      The present study aimed to define attitudes and practice patterns of EEN use by
      members of the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition. METHODS: Members were contacted by e-mail and provided
      with access to a Web-based survey. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 326 of 1162
      (30.7%) eligible North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition members from North America (86% United States, 14%
      Canada). Thirty-one percent of respondents reported never using EEN, 55% reported
      sparse use, and 12% reported regular use. Physicians in Canada reported
      significantly more use than those in United States (P < 0.001). Currently working
      and previously working in a centre where EEN was used were highly correlated with
      both the perceived appropriateness of EEN and the regularity of its use (P <
      0.01). More American physicians than Canadian physicians reported that concurrent
      medical therapy was necessary to induce remission (P < 0.001). Canadian
      respondents were more likely to use maintenance therapy than American respondents
      (P = 0.02). Compliance issues were seen as the main disadvantages of EEN and as
      the major barrier to increased use by nonregular users. CONCLUSIONS: There are
      significant variations in the patterns of use and the acceptance of EEN between
      Canada and the United States, with Canadian physicians showing a greater use of
      EEN. The use of EEN appears influenced by the extent to which physicians are
      exposed to its use both in their training and in their current practice setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

TI  - Food-specific IgG4-guided exclusion diets improve symptoms in Crohn's disease: a 
      pilot study.

AB  - AIM: Exclusion diets have been shown to prolong remission in Crohn's disease
      (CD). We assessed IgG4-targeted exclusion diets in patients with CD. METHOD:
      Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for
      IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most
      reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a
      modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were
      measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients
      did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported 
      symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P =
      0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the 
      excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION:
      IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with 
      an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in
      clinical practice.
