TI  - Quality of life in children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 528-33
AB  - In a 10-week randomised cross-sectional study we used an 88-item questionnaire to
      assess the quality of life in 16 children (ages 8-17 years) with Crohn's disease 
      and their families. The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related
      quality of life, including disease and its treatment, social, emotional, family, 
      education, and future aspects. Crohn's disease affected education, with
      absenteeism in 12 and distraction during school work in six. Three children had
      had a home tutor, and five stated their need for one. Engaging in sports was a
      problem for eight children, mainly because of a lack of energy in five and the
      presence of a stoma in three children. Three children had missed every PE lesson 
      in 1 year. Five children cited the social problem of being unable to stay over at
      friends' houses. Bullying concerned parents more than the children. Holiday
      difficulties included long distance traveling or lack of toilet facilities during
      school trips. Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although the majority
      complained about the taste. Surgery was the most effective method of symptom
      control, though the resulting stoma was upsetting and restricted sports
      activities. Children on steroids had more depressive symptoms. Using the Rutter A
      Questionnaire, five children were designated "neurotic." Parents' views of the
      severity of symptoms significantly correlated with their children's views
      regarding rectal bleeding, poor growth, lack of energy, and poor appetite (p <
      0.01). The main parental concerns were the side effects of medications and issues
      concerning their children's future, including schooling, job prospects, and
      marriage. The parents of 11 children cited problems with children's behaviour.
      The parents of seven cited disruption of work, and those of six named taking
      holidays. Crohn's disease in children, in addition to being a symptomatically
      disabling condition, has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of 
      both sufferers and their parents. The questionnaire was a useful instrument, and 
      with some adjustment it can be used again in large group studies.

TI  - Effect of low- and high-fat, peptide-based diets on body composition and disease 
      activity in adolescents with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 401-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of nasogastric feeding with high- and low-fat,
      peptide-based diets on body composition and disease activity was studied in
      adolescents with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Fourteen patients with active
      Crohn's disease (12 to 17 years) were fed exclusively through nasogastric
      feedings with two isocaloric, isonitrogenous, peptide-based diets, either with
      low- or high-fat content, for 3 weeks each in a randomized manner then were
      "crossed over" to the other diet for another 3 weeks of feeding. At the end of
      each 3-week period, urine and stools were collected for 72 hours for measuring
      energy absorption and nitrogen utilization (n = 6). Weight, height, triceps skin 
      folds, fat free body mass, and disease activity were also monitored (n = 14).
      RESULTS: There was no difference in any parameter of energy absorption or
      nitrogen utilization between the two formulas irrespective of the order in which 
      they were administered. The changes in nutritional parameters were also
      comparable with both formulas. There was a significant increase in weight, fat
      free body mass and triceps skinfold thickness during both the 3-week periods of
      feeding (p < .05). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the
      pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Peptide-based
      diets may be useful in restoring the fat free body mass and improving the disease
      activity in patients with Crohn's disease. A high fat (high medium-chain
      triglycerides) diet did not offer any nutritional advantage over a similar but
      low-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity during feeding with a low-fat
      diet was comparable to that with a high-fat diet. The improvement in disease
      activity seems to be associated with improvement in lean body mass irrespective
      of the type of diet used to achieve it.

TI  - Plasma arachidonic acid-rich phospholipids in Crohn's disease: response to
      treatment.
PG  - 509-12
AB  - 1. Increased concentrations of plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. However, it is not known
      whether there are corresponding changes in circulating phospholipids--the major
      source of fatty acids in the plasma. 2. Fasting plasma samples were obtained from
      17 control subjects and 13 patients with active Crohn's disease [Simple Index of 
      Crohn's Disease Activity (SICDA) > 6] before, and 2 and 8 weeks after, treatment 
      with either a peptide diet or oral prednisolone. 3. Before treatment, the Crohn's
      disease patients had mildly active disease (SICDA 9.9 +/- 0.8, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate 26.4 +/- 6.5 mm/h, serum C-reactive protein 2.8 +/- 0.4 mg/l).
      The proportions of the polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine species, 16:0-20:4
      (10.0 +/- 0.7%) and 16:0-22:6 (7.1 +/- 0.8%), were both significantly higher than
      those in healthy controls (7.6 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.01 and 5.3 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.05
      respectively). 4. After 2 weeks treatment, the SICDA in the Crohn's disease
      patients decreased to 3.2 +/- 0.6 (P < 0.0001 compared with the pretreatment
      value), and there were corresponding falls in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
      (to 12.6 +/- 2.7 mm/h, P < 0.05) and C-reactive protein concentration (to 1.7 +/-
      0.3 mg/l, P < 0.05)--these improvements being maintained at 8 weeks. There was
      also a fall to normal values in 16:0-20:4 (to 7.7 +/- 0.6%, P < 0.01 compared
      with the pretreatment value) and in 16:0-22:6 (to 5.7 +/- 0.5%, P not
      significant), by week 8. 5. The proportions of polyunsaturated
      phosphatidylcholine molecular species were increased in the plasma of patients
      with active Crohn's disease, but fell to normal levels during disease remission. 
      These observations are consistent with the theory that, in active Crohn's
      disease, the mucosal phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids are
      increased, contribute to eicosanoid synthesis and 'spill' into the plasma.

TI  - The significance of colonic mucosal lymphoid hyperplasia and aphthoid ulcers in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 706-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To access concordance between radiological severity of aphthae and the
      more advanced features of Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 75 patients
      with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, we evaluated the radiological
      severity of colonic aphthae by meticulous double-contrast radiography. The degree
      of aphthae was defined as follows: AE0 = no lesions; AE1 = small nodules without 
      barium flecks (lymphoid hyperplasia); AE2 = minute barium flecks < or = 1 mm in
      size with a translucent halo (umbilical or eroded lymphoid hyperplasia); AE3 =
      barium flecks varying from 2 mm to 5 mm in size (typical aphthoid ulcerations).
      We compared the degree of the lesions to the disease activity, and reviewed these
      sequential changes during a mean interval of 10 months. RESULTS: AE3 lesions were
      more prevalent than AE1 or AE2 lesions in patients with active colitis. AE1 or
      AE2 lesions were found regardless of the involved bowel sites or the disease
      activity. Of 44 patients receiving a nutritional diet, 26 patients showed
      regression of the lesions although most of the patients still exhibited AE1 or
      AE2 lesions. In two of eight patients without the treatment, the lesions
      progressed. CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, development of aphthoid ulcers is
      associated with disease activity; lymphoid hyperplasia may exist independently of
      disease activity.

TI  - Therapeutic strategies for pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - The main aims of therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) in
      children and adolescents are (1) the induction and maintenance of remission, (2) 
      the correction of nutrient deficits and (3) the restoration of growth and
      maturation. These goals are reached with the use of a combination of therapeutic 
      methods, including pharmacologic agents, nutritional and psychological support,
      and surgical intervention. The commonly used drugs sulfasalazine, corticosteroids
      and metronidazole have all been shown to be safe and efficacious when given to
      children. Newer steroid preparations that are rapidly degraded either in the
      target tissue or elsewhere are being studied. Of these, budesonide currently
      shows promise as an efficacious drug with few side effects, but its use in
      children needs further study. Newer 5-amino-salicylate preparations such as
      Asacol have been shown to be effective in children, but the number of patients
      studied is small. Immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine and
      6-mercaptopurine appear to be safe and efficacious for children; cyclosporine has
      been used infrequently to treat refractory Crohn disease in children. The use of 
      other agents such as methotrexate, tacrolimus, monoclonal antibodies to
      cytokines, antibiotics and specific dietary products such as fish oils have not
      been intensively studied in children with Crohn disease. Nutritional therapy
      remains a mainstay of treatment because it corrects nutritional deficits,
      replaces losses and stimulates growth.

TI  - Increased energy expenditure in growing adolescents with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1754-9
AB  - Undernutrition is considered to have a central role in the pathogenesis of growth
      retardation in Crohn's disease. This may occur as a consequence of inadequate
      food intake, increased energy expenditure, or both. Ten growing adolescents with 
      inactive Crohn's disease were assessed with respect to anthropometric parameters 
      and resting energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry during
      remission, repeated in relapse (N = 5), and compared to that predicted from the
      Harris-Benedict formula. Mean energy intake was assessed with seven-day diaries
      in five patients and compared to recommended intake for age, sex, weight, and
      physical activity. Ten healthy, growing, age- and sex-matched adolescents served 
      as controls. Nine patients with inactive Crohn's disease, who had ceased growing,
      were matched for disease site and duration and acted as disease controls.
      Patients and disease controls had lower body mass index (19.2 +/- 0.6; 20.9 +/-
      0.7) than healthy controls (23.7 +/- 0.6; P < 0.001). Percent body fat was lower 
      in patients (13.2 +/- 1.9%) compared to healthy controls (20.5 +/- 2.4%; P <
      0.05) but not to disease controls (17.0 +/- 2.6%). Patients had higher resting
      energy expenditure per kilogram of fat-free mass than disease or healthy controls
      (36.9 +/- 5.1; 32.9 +/- 2.6; 30.9 +/- 2.1 kcal; P < 0.02). Measured resting
      energy expenditure in patients, but not in disease or healthy controls, was
      higher than the predicted (measured: predicted 1.15, 1.03, 0.9, respectively; P <
      0.03). Energy intake in patients was 97% of recommended intake but the measured
      ratio of energy intake/resting energy expenditure was lower than the predicted
      ratio (1.49 vs 1.71; P < 0.05). During subsequent relapse in five patients
      resting energy expenditure was unchanged. In growing adolescents with inactive
      Crohn's disease, there is increased energy expenditure that is not accompanied by
      an increase in energy intake. Relapse of disease does not appear to increase
      resting energy expenditure further but may "divert" energy from growth to disease
      activity. This suggests that nutritional therapy should be directed towards
      increasing caloric intake to maximize growth potential.

TI  - Can fish oil maintain Crohn's disease in remission?
PG  - 248-52
AB  - One of the greatest challenges in managing Crohn's disease is to maintain
      remission. Although pharmacologic approaches to maintaining Crohn's disease in
      remission have significantly improved, most of the currently available modalities
      are associated with significant morbidity. Recently, an enteric-coated
      preparation of fish oil has been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of
      relapse in patients with Crohn's disease in remission who are at high risk of
      relapse. Because of minimal side effects, fish oil appears to be an ideal
      maintenance agent in Crohn's disease. However, until results from studies that
      compare the therapeutic effect of fish oil to the currently available maintenance
      agents are available, fish oil supplementation cannot be recommended as a sole
      maintenance agent at present. It does, however, seem prudent to promote a diet
      rich in fish oil in patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids and low carbohydrate diet for maintenance of remission in
      Crohn's disease. A randomized controlled multicenter trial. Study Group Members
      (German Crohn's Disease Study Group).
PG  - 778-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no established therapy for maintaining remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Following different suggestions from the literature, two
      potential interventions for maintaining remission were tested against placebo,
      using either 5 g/day of a highly concentrated omega-3 fatty acid compound or a
      carbohydrate-reduced diet (84 g/day). METHODS: A total of 204 patients were
      recruited after they had had an acute relapse. After remission (CDAI < or = 150) 
      was attained with steroid therapy, patients were randomized to receive either
      omega-3 fatty acids (n = 70), placebo (n = 65), or diet (n = 69). Low-dose
      prednisolone was given to all patients for the first 8 weeks of intervention.
      CDAI and an acute-phase protein (CRP) were used as criteria for a relapse.
      RESULTS: The proportion of patients without relapse within a year were similar in
      the placebo and active treatment group (intention-to-treat analysis: placebo,
      30%; active treatment, 30%; protocol-adhering patients, 29% versus 28%). Patients
      did gain benefit (53%; p = 0.023) for as long as they maintained the diet.
      However, intention-to-treat analysis (diet group, 40%) did not show a noticeable 
      difference when compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids did not
      show an effect on extending the remission in Crohn's disease. For the diet
      patients the question remains whether the noncompliant patients dropped out early
      because they sensed a relapse approaching or whether their condition deteriorated
      because they failed to comply with the diet.

TI  - Diet of South Asians with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 132-5
AB  - The diet of South Asian patients with inflammatory bowel disease was studied
      using a postal questionnaire and compared with controls matched for age and
      ethnic group. Hindus with Crohn's disease are sweets significantly more often
      than either healthy controls (chi 2 = 13.0, P < 0.005) or Hindus who had
      ulcerative colitis (chi 2 = 9.8, P < 0.05). Hindus with ulcerative colitis were
      significantly less likely to drink milk than their matched controls (chi 2 = 7.4,
      P < 0.01). Hindu patients were also less likely to use spices and eat flour than 
      controls (chi 2 = 12.5, P < 0.005). No difference was found in the diets of
      patients belonging to other religious groups and controls. This study again
      suggests that a high intake of refined carbohydrate is associated with Crohn's
      disease, while patients with ulcerative colitis have significantly altered their 
      traditional diet.

TI  - Cyclosporine and 6-mercaptopurine for active, refractory Crohn's colitis in
      children.
PG  - 1355-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open trial of treatment was conducted to determine 
      whether cyclosporine A (CSA) is effective in inducing remission in children with 
      severe, active Crohn's colitis refractory to other medical treatment and if
      remission may be maintained by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid 
      (5-ASA) after discontinuing CSA. METHODS: Ten children (five males, five
      females), ages 1.2-16 yr (mean 11), all had failed to respond to 4 wk of
      treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone and total parenteral nutrition/elemental
      diet; three were already receiving 6-mercaptopurine. CSA was initially given as a
      twice daily i.v. dosage and was switched to oral CSA when a clinical response was
      observed. At the same time, corticosteroids were switched to the oral route and
      tapered over the next 3 months. Patients were grouped by treatment outcome.
      "Responders" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA therapy, "relapsers"
      were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA but relapsed later, and
      nonresponders had not achieved remission after 4 wk of i.v. CSA. Responders were 
      given 6-MP with intent to discontinue CSA after 6 months and maintain remission
      by 6-MP and 5-ASA. RESULTS: There were seven responders to CSA. For all patients,
      the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) (score range 0-100) had a
      mean value of 55 (range 40-65) just before treatment; PCDAI improved to a mean of
      19 (range 5-42.5) after 2 wk of CSA therapy. Four of the seven responders
      discontinued CSA after 6 months and remain well on 6-MP and 5ASA alone for 22,
      13, 8, and 3 months. One patient had massive GI bleeding (from active Crohn's
      colitis), which stopped within 48 h of CSA treatment. There were three relapsers 
      (at 2-6 months of CSA), and three were nonresponders. Three patients who were
      already receiving 6-MP before CSA therapy either did not respond to CSA or
      relapsed while receiving it. The six nonresponders and relapsers required
      surgical resection. Transient side effects included hypertension responding to
      nifedipine in one child and hirsutism and tremors in another. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that CSA offers a good remission rate for children with severe Crohn's
      colitis failing other medical treatment, although relapse was common especially
      if the child was already on 6-MP. In addition, CSA may offer "temporizing"
      therapy in severe, active Crohn's colitis; this may allow surgery to be performed
      electively, with time for psychosocial and nutritional preparation before
      surgery.

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: an update.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - What have epidemiologic studies on IBD taught so far? Consistent findings are as 
      follows: A high incidence of both CD and UC in industrialized countries and an
      increase in these areas of the incidence of CD during the years 1960-80 followed 
      by a plateau phase, and a more stable pattern in UC during the same period have
      been found. A greater number of mild cases have probably been diagnosed recently.
      This also helps to explain the differences in severity and survival between
      community and referral centre groups. The male to female ratio is greater than 1 
      in UC, and this is the opposite in CD. Mortality of IBD has decreased during the 
      past decades. As young people are especially prone to develop IBD, most of those 
      affected will have their disease for many years. In developing IBD, genetic
      influences are of importance. However, epidemiologic studies strongly point to
      possible interactions between genetically determined features and environmental
      or other factors. Of these exogenic factors smoking is the most consistent, being
      of negative influence in CD and protective in UC. Diet and oral contraceptives
      may influence disease expression, and perinatal events such as viral infections
      may alter adult susceptibility. The question remains open whether UC and CD are
      one diseases entity. Similarities in the epidemiologic features of UC and CD
      support the idea of IBD being one disease. Other findings suggest dividing UC and
      CD into further subgroups: in CD it has been suggested that fibrostenotic,
      penetrating, and inflammatory behaviour should be considered different disease
      entities; in UC some groups consider ulcerative proctitis a disease entity on its
      own, separating it from the proximally extending colitis. In therapeutic trials
      this approach has proved to be of importance, and it is not inconceivable that in
      subgroups, with regard to aetiopathogenetic mechanisms, different factors have to
      be looked for.

TI  - Epidemiologic analysis of Crohn disease in Japan: increased dietary intake of n-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acids and animal protein relates to the increased incidence
      of Crohn disease in Japan.
PG  - 741-5
AB  - We examined the correlation between the incidence of Crohn disease and dietary
      change in a relatively homogeneous Japanese population. The incidence and daily
      intake of each dietary component were compared annually from 1966 to 1985. The
      univariate analysis showed that the increased incidence of Crohn disease was
      strongly (P < 0.001) correlated with increased dietary intake of total fat (r =
      0.919). animal fat (r = 0.880), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.883),
      animal protein (r = 0.908), milk protein (r = 0.924), and the ratio of n-6 to n-3
      fatty acid intake (r = 0.792). It was less correlated with intake of total
      protein (r = 0.482, P < 0.05), was not correlated with intake of fish protein (r 
      = 0.055, P > 0.1), and was inversely correlated with intake of vegetable protein 
      (r = -0.941, P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that increased intake
      of animal protein was the strongest independent factor with a weaker second
      factor, an increased ration of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The
      present study in association with reported clinical studies suggests that
      increased dietary intake of animal protein and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      with less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to the development of
      Crohn disease.

TI  - Traditional and complementary therapies used together in the treatment, relief
      and control of Chron's disease and polyarthritis.
PG  - 52-4
AB  - A diagnosis of polyarthritis and later Chron's disease was initially treated by
      traditional treatments and medicines, which was later supported by aromatherapy
      and acupuncture, but the turning point to a full recovery followed from a visit
      to a naturopath and the commencement of an individual/personal diet regime. Over 
      the months of the acute phase of the illness, a valuable insight was gained to
      the challenges of a physical disability and the difficulties of immobility, and
      the loss of independence. Also, the experience of being a patient rather than a
      nursing practitioner, gave first hand experience of the different situations
      patients meet on a daily basis throughout the health care services, both
      traditional and complementary, from a patient's perspective rather than from a
      nursing point of view. The following paper will hopefully help others to consider
      a fresh individual situations, reflect on the collaboration of traditional and
      complementary treatments, and treatment of underlying cause as well as symptoms.

TI  - Smoking is a risk factor for osteoporosis in women with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 367-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease have reduced bone
      mineral density, but the risk factors for osteoporosis in these patients are
      unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of smoking and other lifestyle factors
      on bone mineral density in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we studied
      67 patients with ulcerative colitis, 78 with Crohn's disease, 7 with
      indeterminate colitis, and 73 healthy control subjects. Bone mineral density of
      the lumbar spine and the proximal femur was measured, using dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. Measures of smoking and other lifestyle factors were assessed in 
      an interview. RESULTS: The female ex- or current smokers with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (n = 38) had lower age- and sex-adjusted Z-scores of bone mineral density
      than the female patients who had never smoked (n = 34) (Z-scores in the lumbar
      spine, -0.277 (1.283) (mean (standard deviation)) and 0.487 (1.056),
      respectively; p = 0.008; and in the femoral neck, -0.626 (1.055) and -0.013
      (1.019); p = 0.015). These differences were not explained by the type or
      treatment of the disease, the menstrual history, or the use of estrogen
      preparations. In male patients no differences in bone mineral density were found 
      between ex- or current smokers and non-smokers. Coffee drinking and alcohol
      consumption were not associated with bone mineral density in these patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with low bone mineral density in women with
      inflammatory bowel disease. This association is not related to the body mass
      index, the medical treatment, or the type of disease.

TI  - Supplementary enteral nutrition maintains remission in paediatric Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liquid diets given enterally combined with "bowel rest' are
      efficacious in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but rapid recrudescence
      of gastrointestinal symptoms after resumption of a normal diet is common. AIMS:
      This study examined whether continuation of enteral nutrition as a nocturnal
      supplement to an ad libitum daytime intake of a normal diet increased the length 
      of remission of Crohn's disease in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children and
      adolescents with active Crohn's disease treated successfully with exclusive
      enteral nutrition were classified retrospectively according to whether they
      continued supplementary enteral nutrition or not. Time to relapse and linear
      growth were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Between January 1986 and
      December 1992, 65 patients aged 7-17 years (mean (SD) 13.6 (2.1) years) (36
      males, 29 females) with Crohn's disease in exacerbation were treated for > or =
      four weeks by bowel rest and nasogastric tube feeding of an oligopeptide or amino
      acid based formula. At first follow up visit, remission (fall in Paediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index, PCDAI to < or = 20) was achieved in 47 of 65
      (72%) patients. Subsequently, 20 of these 47 (43%) relapsed by six months and 28 
      of 47 (60%) by 12 months. Patients who continued nasogastric supplementary
      feeding (n = 28) after resumption of an otherwise normal diet remained well
      longer than those who discontinued nocturnal supplements completely (n = 19) (p <
      0.02). Furthermore, continued use of nasogastric supplements before completion of
      puberty was associated with improved linear growth. CONCLUSION: After successful 
      treatment of active Crohn's disease by exclusive enteral nutrition, supplementary
      enteral nutrition without restriction of normal diet is associated with
      prolongation of remission and improved linear growth in children and adolescents.

TI  - Defined-formula diets versus steroids in the treatment of active Crohn's disease:
      a meta-analysis.
PG  - 267-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the effectiveness of defined-formula diets versus steroids
      for the treatment of active Crohn's disease, we conducted a meta-analysis of the 
      published clinical trials. METHODS: Standard techniques for literature search
      were used to identify the pertinent trials. All studies included in our
      meta-analysis (n = 7) were aimed at comparing defined-formula diets versus
      steroids, using a randomized design. The patient-specific end-point of the
      meta-analysis was the occurrence of a treatment failure. RESULTS: Our
      meta-analysis indicated that steroids are more effective than defined-formula
      diets for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. In fact, the relative
      risk of treatment failure (RTF) was significantly lower in the steroid group than
      in the diet group (risk values for patients given steroids compared with patients
      given diet: a) method of Mantel-Haenszel: RTF = 0.35; 95% confidence interval,
      0.23-0.53; p < 0.001; b) method of Der Simonian & Laird: RTF = 0.43; 95%
      confidence interval, <0-0.94; p = 0.03). A separate analysis was carried out in
      which only the subgroup of patients who were not intolerant to diet were
      evaluated; this analysis also showed a superiority of steroids over diet.
      CONCLUSIONS: The data examined in this meta-analysis do not support the use of
      diets as primary treatment for acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease in adults.

TI  - The management of perianal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 227-37
AB  - Crohn's disease (Granulomatous Colitis) is often accompanied by perianal lesions 
      which can be difficult to treat. Different management modalities have been tried 
      with variable results, these included; surgery, medical therapy, and diet. There 
      has been few prospective controlled trials of treatment performed, and from most 
      studies it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions because of the
      variations in disease severity and treatment. The aim of this review is to
      clarify the position of different modalities of management with emphasis on the
      results, and complications.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and nutrition].
PG  - 14S-24S
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential
      mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition
      is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory 
      bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional
      factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is
      yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve
      nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and
      adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not
      substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral
      nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe
      disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and
      intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in
      ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral
      nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in
      active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy 
      with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that
      nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There
      is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets 
      such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of
      formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether
      newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short
      chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this 
      field are warranted.

TI  - Increased resting lipid oxidation in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 72-6
AB  - Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry and body
      composition was assessed by both direct (bioimpedance) and indirect
      (anthropometry) methods in 20 hospitalized patients with biopsy-proven ileal
      Crohn's disease and in a group of 16 healthy volunteers matched for sex, age, and
      height with the patient group. The Crohn's disease activity index was below 120
      in all patients studied, who were treated with a low dose of corticosteroids
      (0.2-0.3 mg/kg body wt of prednisone). The average weight of Crohn's patients was
      significantly lower than that of controls (55.70 vs 70.50 kg, P < 0.001) due to
      both lower fat mass (9.97 vs 18.30 kg, P < 0.001) and lower lean body mass (45.72
      vs 52.20 kg, P < 0.02). The average REE was significantly higher in the control
      group (1785.42 +/- 7.503 vs 1559.1 +/- 48.39 kcal/day, P < 0.001). However, these
      differences disappeared when REE was normalized by lean body mass (LBM) (34.49
      +/- 2.56 vs 34.704 +/- 3.75 kcal/kg LBM P = NS). The nonprotein respiratory
      quotient was significantly lower in the patient group (0.823 +/- 0.031 vs 0.882
      +/- 0.012, P < 0.025), indicating an increased lipid oxidation. This increased
      lipid oxidation might explain the reduced fat stores found in the group of
      Crohn's patients, suggesting also that a sufficiently lipid-rich diet could be
      useful in their nutritional management.

TI  - Total laparoscopic proctocolectomy and laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy for
      inflammatory bowel disease: operative technique and preliminary report.
PG  - 472-6
AB  - We present the operative technique of laparoscopic proctocolectomy along with the
      clinical course of the first four patients to undergo this procedure. The
      operation was conducted through five 12-mm ports. In total laparoscopic
      proctocolectomy, the dissection began with the sigmoid, left colon, and rectum.
      The gastrocolic ligament was opened at the level of the midtransverse colon and
      dissected along with the transverse mesocolon toward the splenic flexure. The
      attachments and vessels of the right side of the gastrocolic ligament and the
      right colon were taken last. This sequence was followed because gradual
      mobilization of the colon displaced all structures in the middle of the abdomen
      and obscured vision. The specimen was extracted through the anus. In
      laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy, it was necessary to incise only the white
      line of Toldt of the ascending and descending colon, mobilize the hepatic and
      splenic flexures, and ligate the vessels of the gastrocolic ligament. Then the
      vessels of the mesentery were ligated near the bowel wall through a 6.5-cm
      midline subumbilical incision from which the abdominal colon was also extracted. 
      The rectum was then completely dissected and sectioned at 10-15 cm from the anus,
      everted, and resected at the dentate line. Mean operative time was 7 h, 18 min,
      and average blood loss was 493 ml. One patient had urinary retention. Return to
      liquid diet took a mean of 4 days. Average postoperative stay, which depended on 
      full return of bladder function and teaching of stoma care, was 10 days.

AB  - Several studies on enteral nutrition undertaken by our group led to the following
      findings: (1) A semielemental diet was as effective as an elemental diet in
      inducing remission. (2) A low-residue diet was useful for the maintenance of
      remission, with the effect depending upon the quantity given. (3) Intractability 
      to enteral nutrition was found in patients with long-standing disease, in those
      with severe activity, and in those with colonic disease. Currently there is
      insufficient evidence to make specific recommendations for altering accepted
      indications for nutritional therapy.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation in Crohn's
      disease: Japanese cooperative Crohn's disease study.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) often flares up and requires frequent hospitalization and/or
      surgery. Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to
      prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its
      therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population.
      Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and 
      to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410
      patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29
      institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission 
      and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly
      higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with
      ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but
      no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative
      remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie
      content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was
      found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to
      prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be
      superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement,
      and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED 
      to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Efficacy of nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 83-7
AB  - We investigated the effect of nutritional therapy with an elemental diet (ED) for
      active Crohn's disease. One hundred and thirty-nine patients with Crohn's disease
      were enrolled in this study. Remission was judged to be present when the
      International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease score was < or = 1 and
      the CRP and ESR values were within the respective normal ranges. An amount of
      30kcal per 1kg of ideal body weight (IBW) per day was administered enterally, and
      the effect on the induction of remission in relation to various patient
      background factors, such as disease type, history of bowel resection, and the
      presence/absence of complications, was determined. An excellent remission rate
      was achieved in those patients to whom an adequate amount of ED could be
      administered. Remission rates were lower in the patient groups with any of the
      following complications: stenotic bowel lesions, abdominal masses, fistulas, and 
      anal lesions. Even in those groups in which stenotic lesions or abdominal masses 
      were present, when adequate amounts of ED could be administered, the remission
      rate did not differ from that in the groups without these complications. The
      remission rates in the groups with and without fistulas at any site, including
      fistulas in the anal region, were 40.0% and 82.5%, respectively, with remission
      being considerably easier to achieve in the patients without fistulas. Similarly,
      remission was difficult to achieve when anal lesions were present. These results 
      suggest that, for active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy with ED ( > or =
      35kcal/kg IBW) should be enthusiastically administered, and in patients in whom
      the presence of complications necessitates therapy for 3 months or more, this
      point be considered to indicate a possible surgical approach.

TI  - Six patients whose perianal and ileocolic Crohn's disease improved in the Dead
      Sea environment.
PG  - 217-9
AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen has been used in the management of perianal Crohn's disease on 
      the assumption that tissue oxygenation is impaired. The Dead Sea region of Israel
      is the lowest point on earth (402 m below sea level), and therefore the oxygen
      pressure is increased. We hypothesized that this elevation in oxygen pressure
      over an extended time might be as effective as shorter periods of high-pressure
      oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. So we investigated whether the Dead Sea
      environment might affect the activity and perianal complications of Crohn's
      disease. Six patients with Crohn's disease unresponsive to medical treatment
      spent periods of 1-3 weeks at the Dead Sea. Four patients had discharging
      perianal fistulas. All were given advice concerning diet, physical activity, and 
      immersion in the Dead Sea. The Clamp-Softley modification of the Harvey-Bradshaw 
      Crohn's disease activity index was used to assess disease activity initially and 
      at weekly intervals during treatment. Drug therapy was tailored to patient
      symptoms. Mean disease activity index before treatment was 9.0 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- 
      SEM) and after a week at the Dead Sea 3.5 +/- 1.4 (p = 0.006). After 2 weeks the 
      index decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (p = 0.037) in four patients. In one patient,
      complete healing of perianal fistulae occurred after 2 weeks, and in two others
      there was striking improvement. Two patients with active Crohn's disease and on
      high-dose corticosteroids were able to stop all medication during their stay.
      Decrease in activity index occurred rapidly, whereas the improvement in perianal 
      disease was more gradual. The Dead Sea environment was highly effective in
      managing patients with severe Crohn's disease, including perianal complications
      in this small, uncontrolled series.

TI  - Extraintestinal considerations in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 633-46
AB  - If one reviews the literature with zeal, it is increasingly apparent that few
      organs escape recruitment when IBD is chronic or progressive. Insights into
      mucosal pathophysiology have helped with understanding the more frequent
      extraintestinal manifestations, but the mechanisms attendant to the development
      of less common events (e.g. acute pancreatitis, concurrent gluten sensitive
      enteropathy, or active pulmonary disease) remain either poorly studied or
      obscure. It is particularly interesting, however, to read reports of abnormal
      pulmonary function, generally of the obstructive type, correlated to measurements
      of abnormal intestinal permeability in patients with either active pulmonary
      sarcoid or pulmonary involvement in Crohn's disease. It has been further
      speculated that similarities in the mucosal immune system of the lung and
      intestine are responsible for evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity in patients
      with active IBD. Finally, it is important to recognize that extensions of the
      inflammatory process are not restricted to the development of organ-based events 
      but may be responsible for some of the most frequent systemic abnormalities
      detected in IBD patients. It is now also well confirmed that the cytokine
      environment in IBD can support activated coagulation and, in some clinical
      situations, overt vascular thrombosis. The cerebrovascular complications of IBD
      are well recognized and range from peripheral venous thrombosis to central stroke
      syndromes and pseudotumor cerebri. Reports of focal white matter lesions in the
      brains of patients with IBD or an increased incidence of polyneuropathy may be
      other clinical examples of regional microvascular clotting. Microvascular injury 
      appears to be more ubiquitously present, with reports ranging from a speculated
      primary causative role (e.g., granulomatous vasculitis in the mesenteric
      circulation) to the utility of nailbed vasospasm, in Crohn's disease, as a
      clinical marker for disease activity. It is also reported that IL-6 suppression
      of erythropoietin production is a major feature of the chronic anemia seen in
      active IBD. Moreover, the capacity of peripheral monocytes from active IBD
      patients to secrete TNF and IL-8 is reported predictive for the degree of
      therapeutic response from recombinant erythropoietin. These collected
      observations constitute another excellent example of the symmetry between basic
      science and clinical utility. It is from the context of applied basic science
      that many future therapies will arise. Empiricism will lose much of its appeal as
      clinical observations will be increasingly translated into cellular language.
      Already in animal models, elemental diets diminish IL-6-related acute
      inflammatory injury, and reductions in dietary lipid alter the antigenicity of
      bacteria. Provocatively, in humans, unconfirmed reports have even associated diet
      therapy with the resolution of uveitis and pyoderma gangrenosum. It is likely
      that efforts will also be made to induce oral tolerance if specific triggering
      proteins are discovered or to alter bowel flora if such an arcane area of
      investigation becomes resurgent.

TI  - Nutritional considerations in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 597-611
AB  - Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there
      are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC.
      Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the
      treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as
      primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been
      associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is
      resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but
      they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused 
      by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides 
      an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional
      support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who
      are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have
      growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.

TI  - Practical aspects of enteral nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition regimens achieve remission from active Crohn's
      disease at rates comparable to steroids and total parenteral nutrition. Despite
      their increasing use there has to date been no assessment of patient tolerance or
      practical difficulties involved. METHODS: We investigated 147 treatments with
      elemental diet in 89 patients and followed this with an anonymous questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: Sip feeding was successfully introduced in 85% with nasogastric feeding 
      being necessary in 22 (15%). Nausea and postural hypotension were common in the
      first week of treatment but vomiting was only seen in three patients who were
      sensitive to the formula used. Two patients each had caffeine withdrawal symptoms
      and hypoglycemia and a further four had food-related night terrors. Our
      experience suggests that caution is necessary if this treatment is used in
      elderly subjects. Although the diets are perceived as being unpalatable, only six
      patients found taste to be a problem after the first week of treatment. The main 
      problem with long-term treatment was the large daily volume requirement, which
      was overcome by increasing the concentration of the feed. Eighty percent of
      patients responded to the questionnaire, and 65% stated that they would opt for
      treatment with elemental diet again in the case of a further relapse.
      CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet seems to be an acceptable and well-tolerated form of 
      treatment in Crohn's disease.

TI  - How effective is enteral nutrition in inducing clinical remission in active
      Crohn's disease? A meta-analysis of the randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 356-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate, using meta-analysis
      techniques, whether enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission
      in active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Randomized trials either comparing enteral
      nutrition with steroids or comparing elemental (amino acid-based) with
      nonelemental diets were selected using MEDLINE (1984 to 1994), reference lists
      from published articles, reviews, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal
      meetings. Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (four published as
      abstracts). Crude rates for induction of remission were collected on an
      intention-to-treat basis by three independent observers. Each study was given a
      quality score, based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio
      (OR) for all type of enteral diets compared with steroid therapy was 0.35 (95%
      CI, 0.23 to 0.53). This result was similar for the best studies (by quality
      score) combined, for trials using tube feeding combined, and when noncompliant
      patients were withdrawn. Further subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of
      the type of diet administered. Peptide-based diets were significantly inferior to
      steroids (pooled OR, 0.32; CI, 0.20 to 0.52). There was a trend to lower
      remission rate after elemental diets than after steroids (pooled OR, 0.44; CI
      0.17 to 1.12). On the other hand, pooled OR for whole protein-based diets
      compared with elemental diets was 1.28 (CI, 0.40 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data
      available to date show that steroids are better than enteral nutrition to induce 
      remission in active Crohn's disease. These results are more evident when
      peptide-based diets are administered, but they are not conclusive when either
      elemental or whole protein-based diets are used.

TI  - Ultrasound examination of the small bowel: comparison with enteroclysis in
      patients with Crohn disease.
PG  - 323-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for inflammatory small bowel disease has hereto relied on
      barium examination, usually performed after duodenal intubation. A noninvasive
      technique for imaging of the small bowel in such patients would be preferable.
      METHODS: A total of 59 patients were included in the study. A small bowel barium 
      examination (SBE) was performed after duodenal intubation using a barium and air 
      double-contrast technique. Ultrasound (US) of the right lower quadrant was
      performed with a 3.5- or 5-MHz transducer. The patients fasted overnight.
      RESULTS: In 37 of 39 patients with a normal SBE, US was also normal. In 20
      patients, SBE showed lesions compatible with Crohn disease and in 18 of these the
      US study showed thickening of the bowel wall. One of these patients later tested 
      positive for Yersinia enterocolitica. There were two false-positive and two
      false-negative US examinations. For detection of inflammatory disease of the
      small bowel, US was calculated to have a sensitivity of 0.95, specificity of
      0.93, accuracy of 0.93, predictive value of a positive test was 0.90, and a
      predictive value of a negative test was 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: US, therefore, seems
      to be a reliable method in the workup of patients suspected of having
      inflammatory small bowel disease. Thereby, US probably can select patients for
      SBF.

TI  - The short-bowel syndrome.
PG  - 514-20
AB  - Patients with a short bowel have usually had a bowel resection for Crohn's
      disease. Two types of short-bowel patient can be distinguished: those with a
      jejunostomy and those with their jejunum anastomosed to a functioning colon. Both
      types of patient have problems with macronutrient absorption, although those with
      a colon experience fewer problems because some energy from unabsorbed
      carbohydrate is salvaged in the colon. Patients with a jejunostomy have problems 
      with large stomal losses of water, sodium and magnesium, whereas those with a
      jejuno-colic anastomosis rarely have problems with water and electrolyte
      absorption. Patients with a jejunostomy 100-200 cm from the duodeno-jejunal
      flexure ('absorbers') usually absorb more from the diet than they pass through
      the stoma and therefore require oral electrolyte or nutrient supplements. Those
      with a residual jejunal length of less than 100 cm usually secrete more from the 
      stoma than they take in orally ('secretors') and therefore require long-term
      parenteral fluid or nutrient supplements. A high output resulting from a
      jejunostomy is treated by reducing the oral intake of hypotonic fluid,
      administering a sipped glucose-saline solution and, often, by giving drugs that
      reduce intestinal motility (most effective in absorbers) or gastrointestinal
      secretions (most effective in secretors). Gallstones are common both in
      short-bowel patients with and in those without a colon (45%), and calcium oxalate
      renal stones occur in the former (25%). However, it is now possible to provide
      adequate nutrition and fluid supplements for most patients with a short bowel,
      and the prospects for the rehabilitation of such patients are good.

TI  - Meta-analysis of enteral nutrition as a primary treatment of active Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1056-67
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The efficacy of enteral nutrition as primary therapy of active
      Crohn's disease is controversial. The aim of the study was to compare by
      meta-analysis the likelihood of clinical response to liquid diet therapy vs.
      corticosteroids and to assess the importance of formula composition to efficacy. 
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing exclusive enteral nutrition with 
      corticosteroids and elemental with nonelemental formulas were identified through 
      a combination of computerized and hand-searching techniques. Rates of clinical
      remission of active Crohn's disease, based on the intention-to-treat principle,
      were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios for
      likelihood of clinical response were calculated. RESULTS: In eight trials
      comprising 413 patients, enteral nutrition was inferior to corticosteroids
      (pooled odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.53). In five trials
      comprising 134 patients, there was no difference in the efficacy of elemental
      versus nonelemental formulas (pooled odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval,
      0.41-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are more effective than enteral
      nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Limited sample size
      precludes definitive conclusions about the importance of formula composition in
      the efficacy of enteral nutrition; however, data analyzed in this study do not
      support an advantage to elemental feedings compared with a polymeric formulation.

TI  - Maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Aminosalicylates are of proven benefit in maintaining medically induced
      remissions of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Even rectal
      5-aminosalicylic acid has been found to be useful in maintaining long-term
      remissions of distal ulcerative colitis. Particularly noteworthy is the
      demonstrated efficacy of oral mesalamine in reducing recurrence rates of Crohn's 
      disease following ileocecal resection, if introduced within the first few weeks
      after surgery. In all cases, the efficacy of the aminosalicylates is dose
      related, with little benefit demonstrable, at least in Crohn's disease, at oral
      doses < 2 g/day. In contrast to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and
      cyclosporine are better suited to the induction of rapid remissions of acute
      disease than to the maintenance of long-term remissions. Antimetabolites,
      especially azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are highly beneficial and
      relatively safe for long-term steroid-sparing therapy in both ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn's disease, at least for those patients whose initial remissions have
      already been induced by these agents.

TI  - Total enteral nutrition support improves body composition of patients with active
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 95-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies using indirect calorimetry in Crohn's disease have
      suggested that with weight loss there is a proportionally greater decrease in
      body fat along with a spring of lean mass. This study analyzed body composition
      (compared with that of controls) by direct methods in a group of 30 patients with
      active Crohn's disease and further evaluated the effects of nutrition support on 
      body composition. METHODS: Total body protein was assessed by neutron activation,
      fat was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, water was assessed by
      bioelectric impedance analysis, and potassium was assessed by gamma-ray
      technique. These measurements were repeated in patients with Crohn's disease
      after 3 weeks of enteral nutrition by feeding tube that provided 35 nonprotein
      kcal/kg of ideal body weight. RESULTS: Compared with age- and sex-matched
      controls, patients had lost (on average) 11.3 kg (16%) of body weight (p <
      .0005), including 5.1 kg (30%) of fat (p < .0005), 2.2 kg (19%) of protein (p <
      .025), 3.7 kg (10%) of water (p = NS), and 24.9 g (21%) of total body potassium
      (p < .01). After enteral feeding, body weight increased by 1.9 +/- 0.3 kg (p <
      .0005). Weight gain was accompanied by an increase in body protein (0.3 +/- 0.1
      kg), fat (0.3 +/- 0.1 kg), and water (1.1 +/- 0.4 kg) (all p < .025), and by a
      nonsignificant increase in total body potassium. The weight gain of approximately
      2 kg consisted of 65% water, 18% fat, and 18% protein, thus comprising a normal
      proportion of body composition. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced body weight in patients with
      Crohn's disease compared with that in controls was due to less fat tissue. With
      modest nutritional repletion, proportionate gains in all body compartments are
      possible.

PG  - 1-7
AB  - The onset of Crohn's disease (CD) is more frequent between 15 and 30 years and
      also has a second peak over 60 years. It female sex it is slightly more prevalent
      among female. Incidence rates vary in different geographic areas, ranging from 2 
      to 4 new cases/100,000 inhabitants/year. Prevalence data range from 1.2 to
      200,000/100,000. Ethnic differences are beginning to disappear, underlining the
      role of environmental factors in the genesis of the disease. At the moment the
      most reliable hypothesis is that CD has a multifactorial pathogenesis: antigenic 
      and environmental factors acting in genetically predisposed patients. According
      to this hypothesis, first degree relatives of CD patients have a relative risk of
      disease ranging from 2 to 4. Many infective agents have been associated with its 
      onset and relapse; the most reliable observations are those related to the
      measles virus. There is an activation of the immunosystem which is shown by
      abnormal T-cell activation, by the increase of some cytokines and by the
      expression of adhesion molecules. The role of oral contraceptives and diet as
      risk factors is controversial. Smoking is the only risk factor positively
      associated with the onset of CD and its clinical course; this association is
      specific and dose-related.

TI  - Controlled trial of oligopeptide versus amino acid diet in treatment of active
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Elemental diets are effective in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease,
      but how they exert this therapeutic effect is unclear. In a previous study a
      whole protein containing diet proved less effective than one in which food
      antigens were excluded, suggesting that exclusion of food antigens from the gut
      was a possible mechanism. This study was designed to test whether an oligopeptide
      diet of hydrolysed proteins was as effective as an amino acid based diet. These
      diets were equally antigen free but with different nitrogen sources. Forty four
      patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised in a controlled trial of
      amino acid versus oligopeptide diet. The feeds were given by nasogastric tube in 
      equicaloric quantities and were the sole form of nutrition. Treatment was
      continued for four weeks although failure to improve by day 10 resulted in
      withdrawal. Quantitative leucocyte scintigraphy was used to investigate the
      effect of diet treatment on gut inflammation. Clinical and nutritional responses 
      to treatment were also measured. Sixteen patients entered remission (including
      withdrawal of corticosteroids), six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric
      tube, and 22 patients failed to respond. The two diets were equally effective.
      Patients who responded had a rapid drop in clinical index of disease activity and
      a major reduction in the bowel uptake of leucocytes on scintigraphy. The
      oligopeptide and amino acid based enteral feeds were equally effective at
      inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. With both diets clinical
      improvement was accompanied by a reduction in intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Dietary habits as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 47-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of dietary factors in Italian patients with
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. DESIGN: We studied dietary habits
      immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a
      prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease
      in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to
      provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet
      between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence 
      were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined
      sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was
      significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, 
      than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly
      higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also
      consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these
      findings, however, remains unclear.

TI  - Remission following an elemental diet or prednisolone in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - The short- and long-term effects of an elemental diet in children with acute
      Crohn's disease were compared with those of prednisolone in historical controls. 
      Clinical remission was induced in 25 of 30 and in 18 of 28 episodes treated for
      six weeks with an elemental diet and prednisolone. Patients with proximal disease
      had longer remission after treatment with an elemental diet (p < 0.05) than did
      patients with colonic disease after treatment with prednisolone (p < 0.01).
      Disease activity index score improved in both groups compared with the
      pretreatment scores (p < 0.05). However, the improvement in the elemental diet
      group was significantly better than in the prednisolone group (p < 0.001).
      Changes in linear growth were better after treatment with an elemental diet
      compared with steroids (p < 0.001). Serum albumin and haematocrit concentrations 
      all improved significantly in the children treated with an elemental diet (p <
      0.001) but not in those treated with steroids. Thus an elemental diet was better 
      than prednisolone in proximal disease and confirmed improved growth and
      nutritional status.

TI  - Alterations in nutritional status and disease activity during treatment of
      Crohn's disease with elemental diet.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which elemental diets induce remission in patients 
      with Crohn's disease is unknown, but it has been suggested that improvement in
      nutritional state may play a part. METHODS: We assessed sequential changes in
      disease activity (clinical and laboratory indices and faecal excretion of
      indium-111-labelled leucocytes) and nutritional status (anthropometry, body
      composition variables), hepatic secretory proteins (albumin, pre-albumin,
      transferrin), and trace elements (iron, magnesium, copper, zinc) during treatment
      of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet. RESULTS: Disease activity
      indices improved significantly by 2 weeks and were maintained at 4 weeks of
      treatment. There was a significant increase in pre-albumin at 4 weeks and an
      increase in serum iron and a decrease in serum copper during the study period.
      The changes occurring in the measures of nutrition did not correlate
      significantly with the changes in disease activity. CONCLUSION: The fact that
      changes in disease activity appear to precede any detectable changes in
      nutritional state, it suggests that the beneficial action of elemental diet in
      patients with active Crohn's disease is not due to an improvement in nutritional 
      status.

TI  - Dietary vitamin D intake in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 578-81
AB  - In search for the reasons of vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease (CD),
      dietary records were evaluated over 7 days in 30 uninformed out-patients with CD 
      (but no current flare-up) by the help of food tables and compared with those of
      30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The study was undertaken in December.
      The nutritional status (height-weight index) was similar in both groups. The
      dietary vitamin D intake was as low in patient with CD (1.0 microgram/d; 0.5-1.3)
      as in the controls (1.1; 0.4-1.6) whereas the recommended daily intake is 5
      micrograms/d. Vitamin D intake correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD)
      levels in patients with low 25-OHD levels (tau = 0.45, p = 0.04). Bone mineral
      content (BMC)-measured by single photon absorptiometry on the radius- was
      decreased in 9 patients (31%) with CD. Patients with CD tended to have a lower
      sun exposure in summer (p = 0.10), which also correlated with BMC (p = 0.03).
      Hence, a specific diet with a high vitamin D content, or vitamin D
      supplementation is recommended in patients with CD to overcome the negative
      effects of low sun exposure on bone mineral density.
