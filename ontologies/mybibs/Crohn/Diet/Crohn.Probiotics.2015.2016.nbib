AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

AB  - Vitamin D has emerged as a key regulator of innate immune responses to pathogen
      threat. The hormonal form of vitamin D signals through a nuclear receptor
      transcription factor and regulates gene transcription. Several papers have shown 
      that vitamin D signaling is active both upstream and downstream of pattern
      recognition receptors, vanguards of innate immune responses. Crohn's disease (CD)
      is a relapsing-recurring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that arises from
      dysregulated intestinal innate immunity. Indeed, genetic studies have identified 
      several CD susceptibility markers linked to mechanisms of innate immune responses
      to infection. Interest in links between vitamin D deficiency and CD has grown
      substantially, particularly in the last five years. While a number of studies
      have consistently revealed an association between CD and vitamin D deficiency,
      recent experimental work has uncovered a compelling mechanistic basis for the
      contribution of vitamin D deficiency to the pathogenesis of the disease.
      Moreover, a number of intervention trials have provided generally solid evidence 
      that robust vitamin D supplementation may be of therapeutic benefit to patients
      with CD. This review summarizes these laboratory and clinical findings.

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that the intestinal bacterial flora together with
      genetic predisposing factors significantly contribute to the immunopathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as reflected by mucosal immune dysregulation.
      Recently, there has been an increased interest in nutraceutical therapies,
      including probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Other dietary interventions with
      low carbohydrate diet, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glutamine have
      been attempted to downregulate the gut inflammatory response and thereby
      alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. Enteral nutrition has been widely used as
      induction and maintenance therapies in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). In
      this review, a critical assessment of the results of clinical trial outcomes and 
      meta-analyses was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dietary and enteral
      interventions for CD.

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum
      Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.
LID - E780 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress
      is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum
      samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with
      Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were 
      significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001)
      and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se
      concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index 
      (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical
      treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time
      since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and
      linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin,
      cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and
      hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and
      cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate
      nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular
      risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in
      undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and
      body iron status.

TI  - Nutrition, oxidative stress and intestinal dysbiosis: Influence of diet on gut
      microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 461-466
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria,
      viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more
      particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal 
      mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the
      composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and
      indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to
      elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal
      microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of
      dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high
      fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In
      contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits,
      vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects
      and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Early Changes in Microbial Community Structure Are Associated with Sustained
      Remission After Nutritional Treatment of Pediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2853-2862
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical remission achieved by exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      associated with marked microbiome changes. In this prospective study of exclusive
      enteral nutrition, we employ a hierarchical model of microbial community
      structure to distinguish between pediatric Crohn's disease patients who achieved 
      sustained remission (SR) and those who relapsed early (non-SR), after restarting 
      a normal diet. METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from 10 patients (age 10-16) 
      and from 5 healthy controls (age 9-14). The microbiota was assessed via 16S rRNA 
      sequencing. In addition to standard measures of microbial biodiversity, we
      employed Bayesian methods to characterize the hierarchical community structure.
      Community structure between patients who sustained remission (wPCDAI <12.5) up to
      their 24-week follow-up (SR) was compared with patients that had not sustained
      remission (non-SR). RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in Crohn's disease
      patients relative to controls and lowest in patients who did not achieve SR. SR
      patients differed from non-SR patients in terms of the structure and prevalence
      of their microbial communities. The SR prevalent community contained a number of 
      strains of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides and was limited in
      Proteobacteria, whereas the non-SR prevalent community had a large Proteobacteria
      component. Their communities were so different that a model trained to
      discriminate SR and non-SR had 80% classification accuracy, already at baseline
      sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Microbial community structure differs between healthy
      controls, patients who have an enduring response to exclusive enteral nutrition, 
      and those who relapse early on introduction of normal diet. Our novel Bayesian
      approach to these differences is able to predict sustained remission after
      exclusive enteral nutrition.

AB  - The most common question asked by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      is, "Doctor, what should I eat?" Findings from epidemiology studies have
      indicated that diets high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables are the 
      most common pattern associated with an increased risk of IBD. Low levels of
      vitamin D also appear to be a risk factor for IBD. In murine models, diets high
      in fat, especially saturated animal fats, also increase inflammation, whereas
      supplementation with omega 3 long-chain fatty acids protect against intestinal
      inflammation. Unfortunately, omega 3 supplements have not been shown to decrease 
      the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease. Dietary intervention
      studies have shown that enteral therapy, with defined formula diets, helps
      children with Crohn's disease and reduces inflammation and dysbiosis. Although
      fiber supplements have not been shown definitively to benefit patients with IBD, 
      soluble fiber is the best way to generate short-chain fatty acids such as
      butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Addition of vitamin D and curcumin
      has been shown to increase the efficacy of IBD therapy. There is compelling
      evidence from animal models that emulsifiers in processed foods increase risk for
      IBD. We discuss current knowledge about popular diets, including the specific
      carbohydrate diet and diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides
      and polyols. We present findings from clinical and basic science studies to help 
      gastroenterologists navigate diet as it relates to the management of IBD.

PG  - 1351-1361
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are
      numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies.
      However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and 
      dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the
      improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's
      beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and
      inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify
      relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from
      inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis','
      intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous
      specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in
      the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched 
      to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of
      IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected
      and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS:
      Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and
      many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In
      addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity.
      CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate 
      immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary
      counselling for IBD patients.

TI  - Changes in Biosimilar Knowledge among European Crohn's Colitis Organization
      [ECCO] Members: An Updated Survey.
PG  - 1362-1365
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2013, a ECCO survey showed that a minority of IBD specialists was 
      aware and confident about the benefits and issues of biosimilars. We aimed to
      look at the evolution of IBD specialists' thinking about biosimilars one year
      after they had become available in the European Union. METHODS: A 14-question
      anonymous survey was posted on the ECCO website. Members voluntarily responded in
      response to ECCO office invitations to participate in their surveys. Information 
      on gender, job position, country, and experience with biologics also were
      collected. RESULTS: Out of the 118 responders, only 17% of responders had no
      access to biosimilars. Most responders regarded cost-sparing [92.4%] as the main 
      advantage of biosimilars, considered immunogenicity [69%] to be their main
      concern, and estimated that post-marketing pharmacovigilance, well-designed
      randomized clinical trials and further studies of risk profile were needed
      [30.5%, 27%, 32.2%, respectively, a 30-40% reduction since 2013]. Only 35% of
      physicians think biosimilars should carry distinct International Nonproprietary
      Names, as compared with 66% in 2013, and 89.8% disagreed with automatic
      substitution of the originator with a biosimilar by a pharmacist. The originator 
      and biosimilar were considered interchangeable by 44.4% of responders, as
      compared with 6% in 2013. Only 32.2% were against the extrapolation across
      indications, and only 25% would not extrapolate data across IBD. Finally, only
      19.5% felt little or no confidence in the use of biosimilars, as compared with
      63% in 2013. CONCLUSION: IBD specialists are generally well informed and educated
      about biosimilars. Compared with in 2013, there are now fewer concerns and more
      confidence about their use in clinical practice.

TI  - Development and Application of a Plant-Based Diet Scoring System for Japanese
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 16-019
LID - 10.7812/TPP/16-019 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets.
      A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn
      disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To
      develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to
      the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained
      on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with 
      Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were
      scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored
      negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores.
      Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were
      evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with
      Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, 
      in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and
      pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2,
      respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and
      normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have
      PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi(2)). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is 
      a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.

TI  - Patients Perceive Clinical Benefit with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 3255-3260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist 
      on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of
      IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous
      online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links
      were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to
      characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the
      SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with
      IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent
      were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative
      colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical
      improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the
      SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and
      42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 %
      reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to
      a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For
      individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported
      associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is
      utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients
      perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.

TI  - Faecal calprotectin: factors affecting levels and its potential role as a
      surrogate marker for risk of development of Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 126
AB  - BACKGROUND: Faecal calprotectin (FC) is one of the most widely used non-invasive 
      tests for the diagnosis and assessment of Crohn's disease (CD) activity. Despite 
      this, factors other than disease activity which affect levels have not been
      extensively reviewed. This is of importance when using FC in the diagnostic
      setting but also may be of utility in studying the aetiology of disease.
      OBJECTIVES: Our review outlines environmental risk factors that affect FC levels 
      influencing diagnostic accuracy and how these may be associated with risk of
      developing CD. FC as a surrogate marker could be used to validate risk factors
      established in case control studies where prospective studies are not feasible.
      Proof of this concept is provided by our identification of obesity as being
      associated with elevated FC, our subsequent confirmation of obesity as risk
      factor for CD and the subsequent verification in prospective studies, as well as 
      associations of lack of physical activity and dietary fibre intake with elevated 
      FC levels and their subsequent confirmation as risk factors in prospective
      studies. CONCLUSION: We believe that FC is likely to prove a useful surrogate
      marker for risk of developing CD. This review has given a theoretical basis for
      considering the epidemiological determinants of CD which to date has been
      missing.

      profile effects of Origanum dictamnus tea ingestion.
PG  - 4104-15
LID - 10.1039/c6fo00560h [doi]
AB  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the repercussion of Origanum
      dictamnus tea ingestion in several volunteers' urine metabolic profiles, among
      them two with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), mild IBD and Crohn's
      disease. Herein, we demonstrate that the concentrations of a lot of urinary
      metabolites such as hippurate, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), citrate, and
      creatinine are altered, which prompts the intestinal microflora function/content 
      perturbation as well as kidney function regulation by dictamnus tea.
      Interestingly, our preliminary results showed that a high dose of dictamnus tea
      intake appeared to be toxic for a person with Crohn's disease, since it caused
      high endogenous ethanol excretion in urine. All subjects' metabolic effects
      caused by the dictamnus tea appeared to be reversible, when all volunteers
      stopped its consumption. Finally, we highlight that individuals' metabolic
      phenotype is reflected in their urine biofluid before and after the dictamnus tea
      effect while all individuals have some common and different metabolic responses
      to this tea, implying that each phenotype has a quite different response to this 
      tea consumption.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks
      course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at
      younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition,
      therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention,
      especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an
      improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this
      disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in
      these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as,
      decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss
      and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional
      monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests
      and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake
      tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's 
      disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply
      demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids.
      Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a
      mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or
      control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and
      improve quality of life.

PG  - 5-10
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2016.1221994 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth factor-beta
      2 (ANS-TGF-beta2) has been used for remission induction and maintenance in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Its use in the preoperative setting has never
      been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 
      to decrease postoperative complications after surgery for complicated ileocolonic
      CD. METHODS: From 2011 to 2015, data of all consecutive patients who underwent
      elective surgery for ileocolonic CD were collected prospectively. Preoperative,
      exclusive ANS-TGF-beta2 was administered in high-risk patients with complicated
      CD. Complicated CD was defined by the presence of obstructive symptoms, and/or
      steroid treatment, and/or preoperative weight loss >10% and/or perforating CD.
      Outcomes of high-risk patients receiving preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 were compared
      to those of low-risk patients with no complicated CD who underwent upfront
      surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent surgery for ileocolonic CD. Among 
      them, 35 high-risk patients received preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 and 21 low-risk
      patients underwent upfront surgery. Preoperative full-dose ANS-TGF-beta2 was
      feasible in 34/35 high-risk patients. Discontinuation of steroids during
      preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 could be achieved in 10/16 patients (62.5%).
      Postoperative complications rates were 8/35 (23.8%) and 5/21 (22.9%) in high-risk
      and low-risk patients, respectively (p = 1). Temporary ileocolostomy rates in
      high-risk patients and in low-risk patients were 4/35 (11%) and 0/21,
      respectively (p = 0.286) Conclusion: Preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 is feasible in
      most high-risk patients with complicated ileocolonic CD and could limit the
      deleterious effects of risk factors of postoperative morbidity. These results
      need to be confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic
      auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important
      multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors
      contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par
      excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors
      (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our
      intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of 
      long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be 
      studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding
      relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over
      the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has
      dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific
      area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger
      chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible
      host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or
      determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential
      en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic
      risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial 
      to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is
      obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a
      goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban
      environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study.
      Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have
      been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD
      cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated
      with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased
      incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis'
      suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to 
      pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus
      prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that
      have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What
      is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the
      environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the
      commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant
      during onset and chronification of IBD.

TI  - Effect of Infliximab and Adalimumab on Experimental Colitis Following Orally
      Supplemented Iron.
PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.1080/08941939.2016.1215574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orally administered iron can induce colonic inflammation in healthy
      animals and aggravate experimental colitis. AIM: To investigate the influence of 
      the biologic agents infliximab and adalimumab on the severity of TNBS colitis
      following orally supplemented iron. MATERIALS-METHODS: 204 Wistar rats were
      allocated into 14 groups. Colitis was induced by TNBS. Iron was administered via 
      a mouth catheter at a dose of 0.027, 0.3, and 3%/kg diet per day, respectively.
      Infliximab was subcutaneously administered on the 2(nd) and 6(th) day in a dose
      of 5 mg/kgBW, while adalimumab was administered on the 2(nd) day in a dose of 2
      mg/kgBW. On the 8(th) day, all animals were euthanatized. Activity of colitis and
      extent of tissue damage were assessed histologically. Tissue Tumor Necrosis
      Factor-alpha (t-TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde (t-MDA) were estimated. RESULTS:
      In normal rats both agents significantly worsen the degree of inflammation
      induced by moderate or high iron supplementation despite the disappearance of
      t-TNF-alpha, and reduction of t-MDA. In the groups of TNBS colitis and moderate
      or high iron administration, both agents again significantly worsen the degree of
      inflammation despite the significant reduction in the t-TNF-alpha and t-MDA.
      CONCLUSION: Adalimumab and infliximab do not ameliorate the inflammation in
      TNBS-induced colitis aggravated by orally administered iron. These findings might
      be clinically relevant in patients with active IBD under concurrent treatment
      with biologic agents and per oral iron.

TI  - An overview of the bacterial contribution to Crohn disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 1049-1059
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.000331 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition primarily affecting the
      gastro-intestinal tract and is characterized by reduced bacterial diversity. The 
      exact cause of disease is unknown; however, evidence suggests that several
      components, including microbiota, may contribute to the underlying pathology and 
      disease development. Perturbation of the host-microbe commensal relationship is
      considered the main driving force of tissue destruction and pathological changes 
      seen in CD. Several putative bacterial pathogens including species from
      Mycobacterium, Campylobacter and Helicobacter are postulated in the aetiology of 
      CD. However, to date, no strong evidence supports a single bacterium contributing
      overall to CD pathogenesis. Alternatively, dysbiosis or bacterial imbalance is
      more widely accepted as a leading factor in the disrupted host-immune system
      cross-talk resulting in subsequent intestinal inflammation. Depletion of symbiont
      microbes including Firmicutes, Bifidobacterium and Clostridia, in conjunction
      with an increase in pathobiont microbes from Bacteroidetes and Enterobacteria, is
      a striking feature observed in CD. No single factor has been identified as
      driving this dysbiosis, although diet, antibiotic exposure and possible early
      life events in presence of underlying genetic susceptibility may contribute. The 
      aim of this review is to highlight the current accumulating literature on the
      proposed role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of CD.

TI  - Patient satisfaction in the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis:
      Results of a Delphi study among patients and physicians.
PG  - 1172-9
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2016.06.036 [doi]
LID - S1590-8658(16)30512-6 [pii]
AB  - GOALS: To determine factors contributing to satisfaction with treatment in
      mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) from both the patients and the
      physicians perspectives. BACKGROUND: Despite the impact of UC on different
      aspects of daily life, patient's and physician's satisfaction with clinical
      management has been poorly evaluated. STUDY: A Delphi study involving 22 patients
      and 20 clinicians was conducted. The patient's questionnaire included 285 items
      regarding diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, whereas the physician's
      questionnaire added 32 specific items for clinicians. Relevance of items was
      scored from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important). Recommendations were 
      based on very highly rated items. RESULTS: Most items were rated consistently by 
      patients and physicians with some exceptions. Patients emphasized the choice of
      moderate flare-ups to be followed at the hospital setting rather than in primary 
      care as well as to be informed on aspects, such as diet and impact of UC on their
      health and lifestyle. Treatment-related efficacy, safety, and improved quality of
      life were relevant for both patients and physicians. Physicians believed that to 
      reduce pill burden was a crucial aspect to improve patient's satisfaction.
      Patients preferred oral administration treatment over rectal treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: The study identified specific aspects related to the management of
      mild-to-moderate UC that both patients and physicians considered to be highly
      relevant for patient satisfaction. Recommendation based on these factors would be
      important at the time of designing and implementing strategies targeting
      satisfaction in UC patients.

TI  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and their treating clinicians have
      different views regarding diet.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis,
      activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based
      guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine 
      the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present
      cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of
      a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry,
      disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and
      surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of
      national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients
      (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds
      of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9
      kg m(-2) and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10
      courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, 
      independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet
      affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the
      importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that
      diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists
      (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis
      of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary
      advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported
      advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed
      recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease.
      IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet.
      Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and
      poorly followed.

TI  - Coexistence of Celiac and Crohn's Disease in a Patient Presenting with Chronic
      Diarrhea.
PG  - 536-8
LID - 2359 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common causes of malabsorption. It is an
      immune-mediated disease manifested by diarrhea, steatorrhea, flatulence, and
      weight loss, caused by ingestion of gluten containing diets. The disease has
      typical small intestinal biopsy features of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia,
      and intense inflammation of the mucosal layer. The disease is rarely associated
      with Crohn's disease (CRD). Studies on the impact of CD on the natural history of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have shown that the natural course of CRD is not
      influenced by coexistent CD. We report a case of 54-year female who presented
      with diarrhea and weight loss. On initial evaluation, CD was diagnosed, and
      responded to gluten-free diet (GFD). Later on, she developed joint pains and her 
      diarrhea recurred. Further evaluation revealed coexistence of CRD. The treatment 
      of CRD was also initiated and this led to marked improvement in the symptoms of
      the patient.

TI  - Nutritional perspectives of children with Crohn's disease: a single-centre cohort
      observation of disease activity, energy expenditure and dietary intake.
PG  - 1132-1137

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Children with Crohn's disease often demonstrate
      nutritional recovery during primary therapy at diagnosis, but long-term
      nutritional support is sometimes necessary. Evidence to inform best nutritional
      practice including energy and micronutrient requirements is limited. The
      principal objective of this study was to determine how energy expenditure and
      physical activity vary with disease activity over the first year following
      diagnosis. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty children were studied at diagnosis with
      Crohn's disease and were followed up over 1 year while receiving treatment
      according to national guidelines. The majority of children (13) were treated with
      exclusive enteral nutrition. At study visits, height, weight, bioelectrical
      impedance, resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, tri-axial
      accelerometer and blood investigations were performed alongside clinical
      assessment. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of disease activity on
      resting energy expenditure (REE). Physical activity was greater after primary
      therapy (Z=3.31, P<0.01). Median wPCDAI fell from 58 at diagnosis to 7.5 after
      primary therapy and was 7.5 at 1 year. Weight s.d.s increased from -1.67 to -0.86
      and lean index s.d.s increased from -2.93 to -1.64, although the increase was
      mostly in the first 2 months. Median height s.d.s was unchanged throughout this
      study. There was a significant association between dietary intake and weight gain
      (r=0.8 P<0.01) but not height gain. Persistent micronutrient deficits beyond
      diagnosis were seen for both iron and vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: This study has
      demonstrated that REE does not change significantly through different phases of
      disease activity, but physical activity is low at diagnosis. Children with
      Crohn's disease should be screened for deficiencies of iron and vitamin D.

TI  - Mouse models of intestinal inflammation and cancer.
PG  - 2109-2130
LID - 10.1007/s00204-016-1747-2 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately one-fifth of all
      human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental
      exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions
      of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to 
      remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue
      destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here, we focus on
      intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the
      rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be
      widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated 
      with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal
      manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article
      highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases
      and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated
      cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models
      of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely
      grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of
      the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in 
      these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in
      the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function,
      and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses
      lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this
      environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis,
      persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of
      proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant
      transformation. With regard to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma,
      however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and
      heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are
      debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and
      prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal
      permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be
      caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of
      them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the
      influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional
      foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some
      hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will
      soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to
      make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are defined as idiopathic, chronic and relapsing
      intestinal disorders occurring in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to 
      environmental risk factors such as diet and microbiome changes. Since
      conventional drug therapy is expensive and not fully efficient, there is a need
      for alternative remedies that can improve the outcome in patients suffering from 
      IBD. Whether exercise, which has been proposed as adjunct therapy in IBD, can be 
      beneficial in patients with IBD remains an intriguing question. In this review,
      we provide an overview of the effects of exercise on human IBD and experimental
      colitis in animal models that mimic human disease, although the information on
      exercise in human IBD are sparse and poorly understood. Moderate exercise can
      exert a beneficial ameliorating effect on IBD and improve the healing of
      experimental animal colitis due to the activity of protective myokines such as
      irisin released from working skeletal muscles. CD patients with higher levels of 
      exercise were significantly less likely to develop active disease at six months. 
      Moreover, voluntary exercise has been shown to exert a positive effect on IBD
      patients' mood, weight maintenance and osteoporosis. On the other hand, depending
      on its intensity and duration, exercise can evoke transient mild systemic
      inflammation and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thereby exacerbating
      the gastrointestinal symptoms. We discuss recent advances in the mechanism of
      voluntary and strenuous exercise affecting the outcome of IBD in patients and
      experimental animal models.

TI  - Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results 
      From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
      disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
      epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
      the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
      and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment,
      consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and
      dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases
      developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched
      with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate 
      odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy 
      intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the
      highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61
      (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) 
      for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34,
      p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals
      consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) 
      and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
      CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
      developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
      Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - L-Arginine Availability and Metabolism Is Altered in Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 1847-58
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide
      (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported
      into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have
      linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to
      determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively
      collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake,
      histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels
      were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
      levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's
      disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of
      arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control 
      subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) 
      and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired 
      involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In
      active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were
      increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from
      Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were
      decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely
      attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2.
      These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of
      dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study
      the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study
      these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort.
      METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the
      International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental
      questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that
      included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets 
      and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included 
      smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029);
      childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and
      chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis
      intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the
      risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and
      pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), 
      and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). 
      Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI:
      0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P =
      0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental
      risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary
      factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet
      ownership offer a protective effect.

      Nutritional Therapy or Corticosteroids.
PG  - 2041-50
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4103-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of remission has been shown to be longer in patients
      initially treated with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) compared to
      corticosteroids (CS). However, no published studies required concurrent
      immunomodulator [6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine (AZA)] use at the time of
      diagnosis. AIMS: The aims of this retrospective study were to compare the
      duration of remission between patients initially treated with AZA in combination 
      with CS or EEN and identify predictors of early relapse in these patients.
      METHODS: Data from 65 newly diagnosed children with CD in clinical remission on
      either EEN or CS and commencing AZA at diagnosis were included. We compared
      duration of remission using physician global assessment and carried out Cox
      regression analysis to identify predictors of early relapse. Patients were
      followed up to the time of first relapse or for at least 12 months. RESULTS:
      There were no differences in the duration of remission between patients initially
      treated with EEN or CS (p = 0.978). We identified younger age at diagnosis
      [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95 CI 0.78-0.98, p = 0.016], lower height Z score at
      diagnosis (HR 0.61, 95 CI 0.44-0.85, p = 0.003), involvement of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract (HR 2.69, 95 CI 1.27-5.66, p = 0.009), and elevated
      platelet count at remission (HR 1.004, 95 CI 1.001-1.008, p = 0.021) as
      independent predictors of early relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Neither induction regime
      demonstrated longer duration of remission of CD in patients treated with
      immunomodulators since the time of diagnosis.

TI  - Towards an integrated understanding of the therapeutic utility of exclusive
      enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1741-51
LID - 10.1039/c5fo01196e [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease characterized by episodic and disabling
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically susceptible
      individuals. The incidence and prevalence of CD is rising rapidly across the
      world emphasising that disease risk is also influenced by environmental and
      lifestyle factors, as well as the microbial community resident in the gut.
      Childhood-onset CD is associated with an aggressive disease course that can
      adversely impact patient growth and development. There is no cure for CD however 
      new onset and recurrent cases of paediatric CD are often responsive to exclusive 
      enteral nutrition (EEN) treatment. EEN treatment involves the exclusive
      consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula for several weeks and it is well
      established as a primary intervention strategy. EEN treatments typically achieve 
      remission rates of over 80% and importantly they are associated with a high rate 
      of mucosal healing, far superior to steroids, which is prognostic of improved
      long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, they are safe, have few side effects, and
      improve nutritional status and linear growth. Surprisingly, despite the utility
      of EEN our understanding of the host-microbe-diet interactions that underpin
      clinical remission and mucosal healing are limited. Here, we review the current
      state of knowledge and propose that the induction of autophagy, in addition to
      modulation of the microbiota and coordinated effects on inflammation and
      epithelial cell biology, may be critical for the therapeutic effects associated
      with EEN. A better understanding of EEN treatment will provide new opportunities 
      to restore gut homeostasis and prolong periods of remission, as well as provide
      new insights into the factors that trigger and perhaps prevent CD.

PG  - 437-44
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with 
      IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and
      nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11
      ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily
      allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for
      carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P <
      0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 
      0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and
      water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy
      children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for 
      calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P <
      0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12
      (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on
      exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different
      polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements,
      children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had
      significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), 
      carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05)
      and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status
      (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements,
      food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and determinant factors in celiac disease. A
      population-based analysis of adult patients in Spain.
PG  - 181-9
LID - 10.17235/reed.2016.4094/2015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) has a negative impact on the health-related
      quality of life (HRQL) of affected patients. Although HRQL and its determinants
      have been examined in Spanish CD patients specifically recruited in hospital
      settings, these aspects of CD have not been assessed among the general Spanish
      population. METHODS: An observational, transversal study of a non-randomized,
      representative sample of adult celiac patients throughout all of Spain's
      Autonomous Regions. Subjects were recruited through celiac patient associations. 
      A Spanish version of the self-administered Celiac Disease-Quality of Life
      (CD-QOL) questionnaire was used. Determinant factors of HRQL were assessed with
      the aid of multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: We 
      analyzed the responses provided by 1,230 patients, 1,092 (89.2%) of whom were
      women. The overall mean value for the CD-QOL index was 56.3 +/- 18.27 points. The
      dimension that obtained the most points was dysphoria, with 81.3 +/- 19.56
      points, followed by limitations with 52.3 +/- 23.43 points; health problems, with
      51.6 +/- 26.08 points, and inadequate treatment, with 36.1 +/- 21.18 points.
      Patient age and sex, along with time to diagnosis, and length of time on a
      gluten-free diet were all independent determinant factors of certain dimensions
      of HRQL: women aged 31 to 40 expressed poorer HRQL while time to diagnosis and
      length of time on a gluten-free diet were determinant factors for better HRQL
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: The HRQL of adult Spanish celiac subjects is moderate,
      improving with the length of time patients remain on a gluten-free diet.

PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2111-7
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i6.2111 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) as nutritional therapy
      for maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS:
      Retrospective chart review was conducted in 11 pediatric patients with CD who
      initiated the SCD as therapy at time of diagnosis or flare. Two groups defined as
      SCD simple (diet alone, antibiotics or 5-ASA) or SCD with immunomodulators
      (corticosteroids and/or stable thiopurine dosing) were followed for one year and 
      compared on disease characteristics, laboratory values and anthropometrics.
      RESULTS: The mean age at start of the SCD was 11.8 +/- 3.0 years (range 6.6-17.6 
      years) with five patients starting the SCD within 5 wk of diagnosis. Three
      patients maintained a strict SCD diet for the study period and the mean time for 
      liberalization was 7.7 +/- 4.0 mo (range 1-12) for the remaining patients. In
      both groups, hematocrit, albumin and ESR values improved while on strict SCD and 
      appeared stable after liberalization (P-value 0.006, 0.002, 0.002 respectively). 
      The majority of children gained in weight and height percentile while on strict
      SCD, with small loss in weight percentile documented with liberalization.
      CONCLUSION: Disease control may be attainable with the SCD in pediatric CD.
      Further studies are needed to assess adherence, impact on mucosal healing and
      growth.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and
      function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent
      studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and
      to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut
      microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies
      underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and
      metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests 
      that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, 
      drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an
      adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early
      gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies
      using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have 
      yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use 
      is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric 
      disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in
      most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are
      anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut 
      microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for
      improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.

TI  - Glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD007348
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007348.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition of the alimentary
      tract with a high morbidity secondary to bowel inflammation. Glutamine plays a
      key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and has been shown
      to reduce inflammation and disease activity in experimental models of Crohn's
      disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glutamine
      supplementation for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH METHODS: We
      searched the following databases from inception to November 15, 2015: MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD 
      Group Specialised Register. Study references were also searched for additional
      trials. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) that compared glutamine supplementation administered by 
      any route to a placebo, active comparator or no intervention in people with
      active Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the
      methodological quality of the included studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool
      was used to assess methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was
      clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included intestinal
      permeability, clinical response, quality of life, growth in children and adverse 
      events. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous 
      outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was 
      evaluated using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Two small RCTs (total 42
      patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study
      (18 patients) compared four weeks of treatment with a glutamine-enriched
      polymeric diet (42% amino acid composition) to a standard polymeric diet (4%
      amino acid composition) with low glutamine content in paediatric patients (< 18
      years of age) with active Crohn's disease. The other study (24 patients) compared
      glutamine-supplemented total parenteral nutrition to non-supplemented total
      parenteral nutrition in adult patients (> 18 years of age) with acute
      exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The paediatric study was rated as low
      risk of bias. The study in adult patients was rated as unclear risk of bias for
      blinding and low risk of bias for all other items. It was not possible to pool
      data for meta-analysis because of significant differences in study populations,
      nature of interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed. Data from one study 
      showed no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates at
      four weeks. Forty-four per cent (4/9) of patients who received a
      glutamine-enriched polymeric diet achieved remission compared to 56% (5/9) of
      patients who received a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet (RR 0.80, 95% CI
      0.31 to 2.04). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence
      for this outcome was low due to serious imprecision (9 events). In both included 
      studies, no statistically significant changes in intestinal permeability were
      found between patients who received glutamine supplementation and those who did
      not. Neither study reported on clinical response, quality of life or growth in
      children. Adverse event data were not well documented. There were no serious
      adverse events in the paediatric study. The study in adult patients reported
      three central catheter infections with positive blood cultures in the glutamine
      group compared to none in the control group (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 122.44).
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow firm
      conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of glutamine for induction of
      remission in Crohn's disease. Data from two small studies suggest that glutamine 
      supplementation may not be beneficial in active Crohn's disease but these results
      need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of
      patients. This review highlights the need for adequately powered randomised
      controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of glutamine for
      induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

      intestinal inflammation in a murine colitis model and suppresses pro-inflammatory

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy is a viable therapeutic option for the
      treatment of Crohn disease (CD). Therefore improving nutritional therapy would
      greatly benefit CD patients. The aim of this study was to define the
      anti-inflammatory properties of a novel nutritional polymeric formula (PF) in
      comparison to a currently available standard PF. METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate 
      (DSS) was utilized to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice with mice randomized to
      receive either standard PF or novel PF in addition to control groups. Changes in 
      body weight were recorded and colonic damage was assessed histologically and
      biochemically. Additional experiments were also included where the cytokine
      response of colonic biopsies from pediatric CD patients was measured following
      exposure to standard PF or novel PF. RESULTS: DSS induced significant body weight
      loss, morphological changes in the colon, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and up-regulated colonic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein
      (MCP)-1, as well as associated histological changes. Other than histological
      damage, these inflammatory changes were reversed by both novel and standard PF.
      However, the novel PF, but not standard PF, completely suppressed TNF-alpha, IL-6
      and IL-8 levels from cultured biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Newly developed nutritional 
      formula reproducibly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in a murine model, although 
      this response was not measurably different to standard PF. However, the novel PF 
      was significantly superior in suppressing inflammatory cytokine release from
      cultured colonic biopsies. Collectively, these findings support a possible role
      for novel PF in advancing nutritional therapy for CD patients.

AB  - The study objective was to investigate the nature and perceived effectiveness of 
      strategies that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) use in response to
      worsening symptoms. Questionnaires to investigate the use and perceived
      effectiveness of 11 types of strategies for coping with possible flare-ups were
      mailed to 1,641 members of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Japan. The
      responses were analyzed separately by disease type: ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn disease (CD). A total of 400 questionnaires were analyzed from 260 UC and
      140 CD patients. The strategies used most by both patient groups were "change
      contents of meals" and "get more sleep." In addition, "skip some meals" was
      commonly used by CD patients. The most effective strategies were "use extra
      topical corticosteroids" (30 of the 56 subjects, 53.6%) among UC patients, and
      "skip some meals" (70 of the 114 subjects, 61.4%), and "take/add to the elemental
      diet" (53 of 89 subjects, 59.6%) among CD patients. The coping strategies used
      most by patients with IBD involved lifestyle modifications. However, the
      additional use of medications was regarded as the most effective, despite the
      small number of patients who used this strategy. Additional use of topical
      medications for UC patients and diet modifications for CD patients should be
      emphasized in self-management education for patients.

AB  - Numerous environmental factors have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. 
      These include smoking, diet, hygiene, drugs, geographical and psychosocial
      factors. These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against
      developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive
      or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of
      environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in
      the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of
      environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some
      factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been
      conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of
      these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents 
      and as modifiers of disease course.

TI  - Advances in nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases: Review.
PG  - 1045-66
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.1045 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal
      tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined
      pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease.
      Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD
      patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only
      improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory 
      activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are
      suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral
      and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in
      different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and 
      there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD.
      This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of
      nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its
      mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as
      therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also
      extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific
      theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about
      them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future
      perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.

      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1148-57
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3987-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We previously reported an improvement in symptoms in Crohn's 
      disease following an IgG4-guided exclusion diet in an open-label study. We aimed 
      to evaluate, in a double-blinded randomized sham-controlled setting, the efficacy
      of IgG4-guided diet in improving quality of life in patients with Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: Consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and a Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) of 80-400 attending tertiary and secondary care centers
      were screened. All patients had IgG4 titers tested against 16 common food types
      using ELISA. The true diet group excluded four food types with the highest
      antibody titers for 4 weeks, and the sham group excluded four foods with the
      lowest antibody titers. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) at beginning and end of the trial. Secondary 
      outcome measures were CDAI, Harvey Bradshaw index, serum C-reactive protein, and 
      fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five subjects were screened
      and 96 subjects had initial food antibody testing performed with 76 patients
      completing the study. Milk, beef, pork and egg were the most commonly excluded
      food types in the true diet group. There was a 3.05 (0.01-6.11) p < 0.05
      improvement in SIBDQ and 41 (10.4-71.5) in CDAI p = 0.009. CONCLUSION:
      IgG4-guided exclusion diet, as an adjunct, can improve quality of life and
      symptoms in patients with CD.

AB  - Despite its importance in maintaining the health of the host, growing evidence
      suggests that gut microbiota may also be an important factor in the pathogenesis 
      of various diseases. The composition of the microbiota can be influenced by many 
      factors, including age, genetics, host environment, and diet. There are
      epidemiologic data associating diet with the development of inflammatory bowel
      disease as well as evidence that diet can influence both the form and the
      function of the microbiome. Based on this evidence, studies are now underway to
      examine the effect of defined formula diets, an effective therapeutic modality in
      Crohn's disease, on both the gut microbiome and its metabolome as a therapeutic
      probe. Diet has an impact upon both the composition and the function of the
      microbiota in part through small-molecule production that may influence the
      development of both immune-mediated and metabolic diseases. By comparing dietary 
      intake, the gut microbiota, and the plasma metabolome in omnivores versus vegans,
      we provide evidence that the production of certain bacterial metabolites is
      constrained by the composition of the gut microbiota. In total, these results
      demonstrate the potential promise of dietary manipulation of the gut microbiota
      and its metabolome as a modality to both maintain health and treat disease.

TI  - Avoidance of Fiber Is Associated With Greater Risk of Crohn's Disease Flare in a

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been
      associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. 
      Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited 
      information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors
      associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in
      patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 
      1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners
      Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis,
      489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at
      baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain
      consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6
      months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff
      values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since
      baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of 
      surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare
      differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber
      consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less 
      likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did
      not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease
      flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI,
      0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients
      with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should
      be re-evaluated.

TI  - Western diet induces a shift in microbiota composition enhancing susceptibility
      to Adherent-Invasive E. coli infection and intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
      involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
      environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
      countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
      century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
      micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
      an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
      in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
      overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
      protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
      expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
      diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
      treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
      Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
      increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
      that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
      activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
      CD patients.

TI  - Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from
      the EPIC Study.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated
      associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks.
      METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases
      of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded
      at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios
      of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet
      score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No 
      dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when
      excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment,
      there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern
      and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68
      [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the 
      pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if
      they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high
      consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was
      associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.

PG  - 1288-92
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting any part of the
      digestive tract which relapses and remits throughout the disease course. It
      occurs in individuals with genetic susceptibility and involves an abnormal
      response of the immune system to the external environment. Besides, improved
      hygiene, abuse of antibiotics, westernization of diet with high sugar and fat are
      thought to be associated with rapidly increasing incidence of CD. Certain
      components of foods may influence gut inflammation through antigen presentation
      and alteration of the microflora. This article aims mainly to review diet-related
      clinical studies to outline its roles in the pathogenesis and progress of
      disease, and then give some evidence-based suggestions.

TI  - Specific carbohydrate diet for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in clinical
      practice within an academic IBD center.

LID - S0899-9007(15)00389-5 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Enteral Feeding Therapy for Maintaining Remission in Crohn's Disease: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 550-561
LID - 10.1177/0148607115621051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) for maintaining remission in
      patients with inactive Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear. The aim of this article
      was to systematically identify, review, and critically appraise the evidence on
      efficacy of EN in maintaining medically induced remission in CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Several databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for
      relevant citations of published randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized
      cohort studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion and
      assessed study quality and risk of bias. The primary outcome was relapse rate in 
      patients with inactive CD who have been in medically induced remission and
      subsequently started or maintained on EN. RESULTS: Twelve studies (1169 patients,
      including 95 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. As the included studies 
      were significantly heterogeneous, a meta-analysis was not performed. Eleven
      studies showed that EN was either better than, or as effective as, the comparator
      in maintaining remission in patients with inactive CD. No major EN-related
      adverse events were reported. Only 1 adult randomized controlled trial (n = 51), 
      with low risk of bias, compared EN with regular diet and found a relapse rate of 
      34% in the EN group versus 64% in the control group ( P < .01) after a mean
      follow-up of 11.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: EN is more effective than regular diet and
      as effective as some medications in maintaining remission for patients with
      inactive CD. Large, properly designed randomized controlled studies of sufficient
      duration are required to confirm this conclusion for EN versus individual
      medications.

TI  - A snapshot of the nutritional status of Crohn's disease among adolescents in
      Brazil: a prospective cross-sectional study.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0403-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) is
      complex and involves several therapeutic possibilities including: nutrition
      treatment for malnourished patients, optimization of growth and development,
      prevention of osteoporosis, first-line therapy for active disease, and
      maintenance of disease remission. In children and adolescents with CD,
      malnutrition is a common problem that adversely affects the prognosis. In at-risk
      adolescent CD patients, it is important to assess body composition, food intake, 
      energy expenditure, nutrient balance and serum levels of nutrients before
      planning interventions for this population. The aim of this study was to provide 
      a snapshot of the nutritional status of adolescents with CD in Brazil. METHODS:
      We prospectively selected 22 patients with mildly to moderately active CD, 29
      patients with inactive CD and 35 controls (first-degree relatives of and in the
      same age bracket as the CD patients). The age range of participants was between
      13.2 and 19.4 years old. We collected anthropometric data including weight,
      height, and body mass index (BMI), which were expressed as Z scores:
      weight-for-age, height-for-age and BMI-for-age, respectively, as well as using
      bioimpedance to determine body composition and assessing the Tanner stage. We
      also assessed macronutrients and micronutrients (serum levels and dietary intake 
      of both). We used the chi-square test to determine whether any of the studied
      variables were associated with inactive or active CD. The level of significance
      was set at 5 % (p < 0.05). We have written informed parental consent for
      participation for any minors and written informed consent for any participants
      that were adults. RESULTS: The mean values for lean body mass, Tanner stage,
      height-for-age Z score and BMI-for-age Z score were lower in the active CD group 
      than in the inactive CD and control groups (p < 0.05 for both). Compared with the
      controls, the CD patients showed significant differences in terms of the quality 
      of dietary intake (particularly in caloric intake, dietary protein intake,
      dietary fiber intake, and micronutrient intake), which were reflected in the
      serum levels of nutrients, mainly vitamins A and E (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Adolescents with CD (including those with mildly to moderately active or inactive
      disease) have a nutritional risk, which makes it important to conduct nutritional
      assessments in such patients.

TI  - EHealth: self-management in inflammatory bowel disease and in irritable bowel
      syndrome using novel constant-care web applications. EHealth by constant-care in 
      IBD and IBS.
PG  - B5168
LID - B5168 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      are chronic gastrointestinal disorders of unknown aetiology of increasing
      incidence and changing disease activity or severity. Approximately 60-80% of IBD 
      patients suffer from IBS. Monitoring and treatment goals of IBD are to optimise
      the disease course by prolonging remission periods and preventing or shortening
      periods of active disease. Constant-care web-monitoring and treatment approaches 
      with active patient involvement have been proven effective in UC, increasing
      patients' adherence and improving the disease outcomes. AIM: To assess the
      feasibility and efficacy of the novel constant-care eHealth applications in: i)
      CD patients treated with infliximab (IFX), ii) UC patients with active disease on
      mesalazine, iii) IBS patients and iv) IBD patients with IBS on a low FODMAP diet 
      (LFD). METHODS: New constant-care web applications www.cd.constant-care.dk,
      www.meza.constant-care.dk and www.ibs.constant-care.dk in IBD patients were
      developed and assessed in this thesis. An integrated inflammatory burden measure 
      of disease activity, consisting of a subjective (clinical indices) and of an
      objective (faecal calprotectin) part and a treatment guide to drug doses and
      intervals, was incorporated into the web applications and used by patients.
      RESULTS: Web-guided IFX treatment in CD demonstrated patients' inter- and
      intra-individual variability in infusion intervals and provided patients with
      individualised treatment according to their needs. Web-guided treatment with
      multimatrix mesalazine was efficacious in a majority of UC patients with
      mild-to-moderate disease activity. Web-guided IBS-monitoring in IBD and in IBS
      patients on LFD was shown to be a feasible method that actively involved patients
      in their disease management and had a positive short-term impact on the disease. 
      Moreover, the new constant-care concepts were demonstrated to be safe and to have
      a positive impact on quality of life and adherence to treatment and helped to
      reduce the costs. CONCLUSIONS: The novel constant-care web applications have
      proven feasible in improving the disease outcomes in CD patients on IFX, in UC
      patients on mesalazine, and in monitoring IBS. These applications are expected to
      be implemented in the clinical practice of gastroenterology in Denmark in the
      coming years. Future studies will help to assess whether the natural disease
      course can be improved in the long-term.

AB  - Since the first publication on "regional ileitis", the relevance of this chronic 
      inflammatory disease condition termed finally as Crohn's disease is continuously 
      increasing. Although we are beginning to comprehend certain aspects of its
      pathogenesis, many facets remain unexplored. Host's gut microbiota is involved in
      a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including immune system 
      development, and pathogen regulation. Further, the microbiome is thought to play 
      a key role in Crohn's disease. The presence of Crohn's-associated variants of
      NOD2 and ATG16L genes appears to be associated not only with alterations of
      mucosal barrier functions, and bacterial killing, but the gut microbiota, as
      well, reflecting a potential relationship between the host's genotype and
      intestinal dysbiosis, involved in disease etiology. This review aims to
      characterize some exciting new aspect of Crohn's disease pathology, focusing
      mainly on the role of intestinal microbes, and their interplay with the immune
      system of the host.

TI  - Zinc intake and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1995-2005
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyv301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through
      effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the 
      intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses 
      Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc
      intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires
      administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record
      review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders
      determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. 
      RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269
      incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9
      mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with
      women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for
      CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second 
      quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% 
      CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the
      highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc 
      (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake 
      from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was
      inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.

AB  - Abnormal composition of intestinal bacteria--"dysbiosis"-is characteristic of
      Crohn's disease. Disease treatments include dietary changes and immunosuppressive
      anti-TNFalpha antibodies as well as ancillary antibiotic therapy, but their
      effects on microbiota composition are undetermined. Using shotgun metagenomic
      sequencing, we analyzed fecal samples from a prospective cohort of pediatric
      Crohn's disease patients starting therapy with enteral nutrition or anti-TNFalpha
      antibodies and reveal the full complement and dynamics of bacteria, fungi,
      archaea, and viruses during treatment. Bacterial community membership was
      associated independently with intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and
      therapy. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased dysbiosis, whereas
      dysbiosis decreased with reduced intestinal inflammation. Fungal proportions
      increased with disease and antibiotic use. Dietary therapy had independent and
      rapid effects on microbiota composition distinct from other stressor-induced
      changes and effectively reduced inflammation. These findings reveal that
      dysbiosis results from independent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotics
      and shed light on Crohn disease treatments.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman with Crohn's disease, who had been on home parenteral
      nutrition for many years, presented with perioral paraesthesia and a burning
      sensation in the mouth. Initial blood tests including serum ferritin, vitamin B12
      and folate, were normal apart from mild pancytopaenia. Serum copper was low, in
      spite of receiving regular copper in her parenteral feeds. The copper in her
      parenteral feeds was increased initially, but when it did not improve, she was
      started on weekly intravenous copper infusions. She was using dental adhesive,
      which had zinc in it, and a possibility that this was causing her copper
      deficiency was raised. Serum zinc levels were normal, but urinary zinc was very
      high. The patient was advised to use zinc-free dental adhesive and her copper
      level returned to normal within a few months with normalisation of her
      pancytopaenia, and partial resolution of her oral paraesthesia.

AB  - Inflammation is a protective process for life that aims to restore body
      homeostasis by targeting the injury and by inducing repair mechanisms. This
      process can also become excessive and lead to chronic inflammation and organ
      fibrosis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids play a key role in inflammatory processes
      and their resolution. Indeed, numerous lipid mediators derived from n-3 or n-6
      PUFA such as eicosanoids, endocannabinoids, or proresolving lipids are able to
      target transcription factors to modulate gene expression. One other important
      action mechanism is by modification of cell membrane composition. The purpose of 
      the present review is to describe the potential mechanisms by which PUFA
      influence inflammatory processes. To illustrate this purpose, we focused on the
      interactions between PUFA and intestinal inflammation as an integrative example.

TI  - The Pharmacokinetic Profile of a New Gastroresistant Capsule Preparation of

PG  - 360825

AB  - Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may be
      beneficial for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study we 
      analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free 
      fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects
      received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell
      (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by
      2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4%
      total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a
      concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation
      of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were
      apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated
      and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was
      detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can
      be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this
      enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of
      compliance.

TI  - Th17 response and autophagy--main pathways implicated in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease by genome-wide association studies.
PG  - 559-65
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an entity that mainly includes ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and Crohn s disease (CD). Improved health care, diet changes, and
      higher industrialization are associated with an increase in IBD prevalence. This 
      supports the central role of environmental factors in the pathology of this
      disease. However, IBD also shows a relevant genetic component as shown by high
      heritability. Classic genetic studies showed relevant associations between IBD
      susceptibility and genes involved in the immune response. This is consistent with
      prior theories about IBD development. According to these, contact of the immune
      system with a high number of harmless antigens from the diet and the bacterial
      flora should originate tolerance while preserving response against pathogens.
      Failure to achieve this balance may originate the typical inflammatory response
      associated with IBD. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have
      confirmed the implication of the immune system, particularly the Th17 immune
      response, previously associated to other autoimmune diseases, and of autophagy.
      In this paper, the mechanisms involved in these two relevant pathways and their
      potential role in the pathogenesis of IBD are reviewed.

AB  - Much has been written about the role of diet and risk for Crohn's disease (CD).
      However, the evidence is contradictory. Recent evidence has pointed to fiber
      playing an important role along with the possibility that dietary fat and
      overnutrition also have a role. Diet has a clearer place in disease modification,
      with some diets used in the treatment of CD. The lack of clarity stems from a
      poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between diet and
      CD. Gut permeability is likely to play a key role in the risk for CD. Mechanisms 
      whereby diet can affect gut permeability, including the effects of the gut
      microbiota, are reviewed. Modification of disease behavior is likely to be
      influenced by additional mechanisms, including recognition of complex food
      antigens. As with many other chronic diseases, a surrogate marker of CD risk
      would greatly aid evaluation of the dietary factors involved. Formal measures of 
      gut permeability are too cumbersome for large-scale use, but fecal calprotectin
      may be a convenient measure of this. There are only preliminary data on the
      effect of diet and microbiota composition on fecal calprotectin and these require
      further investigation.

AB  - The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis, has risen alarmingly in the Western and
      developing world in recent decades. Epidemiologic (including monozygotic twin and
      migrant) studies highlight the substantial role of environment and nutrition in
      IBD etiology. Here we review the literature supporting the developmental and
      environmental origins hypothesis of IBD. We also provide a detailed exploration
      of how the human microbiome and epigenome (primarily through DNA methylation) may
      be important elements in the developmental origins of IBD in both children and
      adults.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's
      disease: current status and future perspectives.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2348-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The value of enteral nutrition (EN) as maintenance therapy in patients
      with quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of 
      this study was to review the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Seven prospective cohort studies evaluating 
      the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in quiescent CD were
      included. Three of the seven studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In
      all studies, patients used EN as a supplement or as a nocturnal tube feeding in
      addition to their normal food. RESULTS: One study compared the efficacy of
      elemental diet and polymeric diet. Elemental and polymeric diets were equally
      effective for the maintenance of clinical remission and for allowing tapering and
      cessation of steroid therapy. The other six studies compared the outcomes between
      patients treated with and without EN. The maintained clinical remission rate at 1
      year was significantly higher in patients treated with EN in four of the six
      studies. Quantitative pooling of the studies was not feasible due to a small
      number of RCTs and a narrative account of the study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our review suggests that EN is useful for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. However, there are several limitations in the
      reviewed studies. There are few RCTs. Further, the sample size is small, and the 
      duration of intervention and follow-up is short. Large and well-designed RCTs
      should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of EN for maintaining
      remission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies 
      of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet
      and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included
      women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school
      dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns
      (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We
      documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of 
      medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for
      confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC.
      RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases 
      of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a
      prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and
      fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio,
      0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater 
      intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with
      lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of
      CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was
      associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD,
      but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

      Crohn's Disease Patients in New Zealand.
PG  - 70-80
LID - 10.1159/000435783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is known to play a major role in Crohn's disease (CD). It has
      also been reported that the minor G allele from the rs12212067 polymorphism (T>G)
      in FOXO3 is associated with milder CD. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the association between the rs12212067 polymorphism and food intolerances for a
      total of 253 foods. METHODS: Tolerances and intolerances were recorded on a
      self-reported dietary questionnaire. Each food was scored on a 5-point ordinal
      scale: beneficial effects as '+ +' or '+', adverse effects as '- -' or '-', and
      'makes no difference' as '='. Dietary and genotype data were available for a
      total of 283 CD patients. RESULTS: We identified 17 foods with beneficial effects
      in our study which were significantly associated with the G allele of the FOXO3
      rs12212067 polymorphism. Of these, sweet potatoes had the highest reported
      frequency of beneficial responses. We also identified 4 foods with detrimental
      effects in more than 25% of our study population. These were mustard, wasabi, and
      raw and cooked tomatoes, which again were significantly associated with the G
      allele in FOXO3. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence that adverse effects of
      mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes were significantly associated with
      the G allele of FOXO3 and that these foods should be avoided by people carrying
      this allele.

TI  - Systematic review: bile acids and intestinal inflammation-luminal aggressors or
      regulators of mucosal defence?
PG  - 802-17
LID - 10.1111/apt.13333 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions attributed to an aberrant immune 
      response to luminal triggers. Recently, published work suggests a pathogenic role
      for bile acids in this context. AIM: To perform a systematic review of studies
      investigating the role of bile acids in intestinal inflammation and present
      potentially relevant clinical implications. METHODS: Pubmed search for English
      language articles published up to May 2015. Terms used were: 'bile', 'bile acid',
      'barrier', 'small bowel injury', 'Crohn's' and 'colitis'. RESULTS: Experimental
      studies support a variable role for bile acids in intestinal barrier
      homoeostasis. This may be attributed to different physicochemical properties,
      variable effects on epithelia and immune cells via bile acids-specific receptors,
      or through a cross-talk with the gut microbiome. A reduction in the bile acids
      pool, with lower concentrations of secondary forms, has been recognised for some 
      time in Crohn's disease and associated to ileal dysfunction and bile acids
      malabsorption. Recent work suggests that these changes, including an increase in 
      sulphated forms, are related to inflammatory activity in both Crohn's disease and
      UC. The detrimental effects of 'western diet' elements such as emulsifiers and
      fat, which have been implicated in the development of the current IBD and obesity
      epidemics, may also be bile acid-mediated. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are only a
      few observational clinical studies to support an interaction, in vivo human and
      animal studies support an association between bile acids metabolism, the gut
      microbiome and intestinal inflammation. This may well prove to have significant
      diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

      diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut
      microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of 
      this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with
      active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
      Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and
      healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake
      of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency
      questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with
      different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between
      intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken.
      RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median
      2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6
      g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower
      oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d,
      2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences 
      in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations
      between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and
      oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain
      score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho =
      -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume
      lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts
      and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut
      microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.

TI  - The Roles of Inflammation, Nutrient Availability and the Commensal Microbiota in 
      Enteric Pathogen Infection.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.MBP-0008-2014 [doi]
AB  - The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to
      more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed
      diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members
      engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several
      layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the
      field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our
      understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes
      that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of
      human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2
      diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered
      microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the
      composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over 
      time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by
      environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A
      general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in
      the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed
      colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be
      transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high
      levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes 
      in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of
      diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or
      increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion
      is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease.
      Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial
      families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
      Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio
      cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members
      of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of
      the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic
      trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy,
      dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota
      not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic
      immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over
      microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the
      microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out,"
      respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is
      particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The
      symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an
      excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is
      assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic
      predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier
      function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an
      abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed 
      (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance
      of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at
      the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes
      Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or
      a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are
      equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in
      the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way
      that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current
      state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut
      inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections
      and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric
      pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic
      microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of
      pathogenicity.

TI  - Dietary Fiber Intake is Associated with Increased Colonic Mucosal GPR43+
      Polymorphonuclear Infiltration in Active Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 5327-46
LID - 10.3390/nu7075223 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor 43/free fatty acid receptor 2 (GPR43/FFAR2) is
      essential for polymorphonuclear (PMN) recruitment. We investigated the expression
      of GPR43/FFAR2 in the colon from Crohn's disease patients and whether dietary
      fiber in enteral nutrition increases GPR43+ polymorphonuclear infiltration in
      mucosa. Segments of ascending colon and white blood cells from peripheral blood
      were obtained from 46 Crohn's disease patients and 10 colon cancer patients. The 
      Crohn's disease patients were grouped by the activity of disease (active or
      remission) and enteral nutrition with or without dietary fiber. Histological
      feature, expression and location of GPR43/FFAR2 and level of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase were
      assessed. The results of hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining
      revealed that the infiltration of immune cells, including GPR43+ PMN, was more
      severe in active Crohn's disease patients who consumed normal food or enteral
      nutrition with dietary fiber than in remission patients and colon cancer
      patients. This finding was supported by the results of GPR43 and myeloperoxidase 
      expression. Active Crohn's disease (CD) patients who consumed enteral nutrition
      without dietary fiber exhibited severe immune cell infiltration similar to the
      other active CD patients, but GPR43+ PMNs were rarely observed. The level of
      TNF-alpha mRNA in active Crohn's disease patients was higher than those of the
      other patients. In conclusion, the use of dietary fiber in enteral nutrition by
      active Crohn's disease patients might increase GPR43+ PMNs infiltration in colon 
      mucosa. This effect was not observed in Crohn's disease patients in remission.

AB  - Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the
      relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but
      the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively 
      summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of
      Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The 
      combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. 
      Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We
      hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would
      indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested 
      case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this
      study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative
      colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 
      0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response
      relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD
      decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The
      results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was
      significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Severe scurvy: an underestimated disease.
PG  - 1076-7
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.99 [doi]
AB  - Scurvy is one of the oldest diseases in human history. Nowadays, although scurvy 
      tends to become a forgotten disease in developed country, rare cases still occur,
      especially in people undergoing extreme diet, old people or children with poor
      diet and patients with malabsorption. We describe three cases of scurvy. The
      first case is a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease, the second one is in a
      context of anorexia nervosa and drug addiction, and the third case is in a
      context of social isolation. Early recognition of scurvy can be difficult because
      symptoms may appear nonspecific and can mimic more common conditions. In any
      patient with spontaneous hematoma and purpura, in the context of nutritional
      disorder, scurvy should be systematically considered. As this disease can lead to
      severe complications, such as bone pain, heart failure or gastrointestinal
      symptoms, nothing should delay vitamin C supplementation, which is a simple and
      rapidly effective treatment.

AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition involves the use of a complete liquid diet, with the 
      exclusion of normal dietary components for a defined period of time, as a
      therapeutic measure to induce remission in active Crohn's disease (CD). This very
      efficacious approach leads to high rates of remission, especially in children and
      adolescents newly diagnosed with CD. This intervention also results in mucosal
      healing, nutritional improvements and enhanced bone health. Whilst several recent
      studies have provided further elaboration of the roles of exclusive enteral
      nutrition in the management of CD, other reports have provided new understanding 
      of the mechanisms by which this intervention acts.

TI  - Toward enteral nutrition for the treatment of pediatric Crohn disease in Canada: 
      a workshop to identify barriers and enablers.
PG  - 351-6
LID - 16819 [pii]
AB  - The treatment armamentarium in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) is very similar to
      adult-onset CD with the notable exception of the use of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN [the administration of a liquid formula diet while excluding
      normal diet]), which is used more frequently by pediatric gastroenterologists to 
      induce remission. In pediatric CD, EEN is now recommended by the pediatric
      committee of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition as a
      first-choice agent to induce remission, with remission rates in pediatric studies
      consistently >75%. To chart and address enablers and barriers of use of EEN in
      Canada, a workshop was held in September 2014 in Toronto (Ontario), inviting
      pediatric gastroenterologists, nurses and dietitians from most Canadian pediatric
      IBD centres as well as international faculty from the United States and Europe
      with particular research and clinical expertise in the dietary management of
      pediatric CD. Workshop participants ranked the exclusivity of enteral nutrition; 
      the health care resources; and cost implications as the top three barriers to its
      use. Conversely, key enablers mentioned included: standardization and sharing of 
      protocols for use of enteral nutrition; ensuring sufficient dietetic resources;
      and reducing the cost of EEN to the family (including advocacy for reimbursement 
      by provincial ministries of health and private insurance companies). Herein, the 
      authors report on the discussions during this workshop and list strategies to
      enhance the use of EEN as a treatment option in the treatment of pediatric CD in 
      Canada.

PG  - 6001-7
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i19.6001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between patient disease knowledge of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and health related quality of life (HRQoL) and
      identify patient and disease related predictors of patient knowledge of IBD.
      METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of IBD patients with an established
      diagnosis of IBD longer than 3 mo prior to enrollment. The Crohn's and colitis
      knowledge score (CCKNOW) and short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire
      (SIBDQ) were self-administered to assess patient knowledge of IBD and HRQoL,
      respectively. Demographic and disease characteristics were abstracted from the
      electronic medical record. The correlation between CCKNOW and SIBDQ scores was
      assessed by a linear regression model. Associations of patient knowledge and the 
      variables of interest were calculated using ANOVA. RESULTS: A total of 101
      patients were recruited. Caucasian race, younger age at diagnosis, and having a
      college or post-graduate degree were significantly associated with higher CCKNOW 
      scores. Patients with CD had higher CCKNOW scores compared to patients with
      ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease type unclassified, P < 0.01.
      There was no significant correlation between overall CCKNOW and SIBDQ scores (r
      (2) = 0.34, P = 0.13). The knowledge sub-domain of diet in CCKNOW was negatively 
      correlated with HRQoL (r (2) = 0.69, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IBD diagnosis at a
      younger age in addition to Caucasian race and higher education were significantly
      associated with higher knowledge about IBD. However, patient knowledge of IBD was
      not correlated with HRQoL. Further studies are required to study the effect of
      patient knowledge of IBD on other clinical outcomes.

      Children with Active Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1786-93
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic targets in pediatric Crohn's disease include symptoms,
      quality of life (QOL), and mucosal healing. Although partial enteral nutrition
      (PEN), exclusive enteral nutritional (EEN), and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha 
      (anti-TNF) therapy all improve symptoms, the comparative effectiveness of these
      approaches to improve QOL and achieve mucosal healing has not been assessed
      prospectively. METHODS: In a prospective study of children initiating PEN, EEN,
      or anti-TNF therapy for Crohn's disease, we compared clinical outcomes using the 
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), QOL (IMPACT score), and mucosal
      healing as estimated by fecal calprotectin (FCP). PCDAI, IMPACT, FCP, and diet
      (prompted 24-h recall) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy.
      RESULTS: We enrolled 90 children with active Crohn's disease (PCDAI, 33.7 +/-
      13.7; and FCP, 976 +/- 754), of whom 52 were treated with anti-TNF, 22 with EEN, 
      and 16 with PEN plus ad lib diet. Clinical response (PCDAI reduction >/=15 or
      final PCDAI </=10) was achieved by 64% on PEN, 88% EEN, and 84% anti-TNF (test
      for trend P = 0.08). FCP </=250 mug/g was achieved with PEN in 14%, EEN 45%, and 
      anti-TNF 62% (test for trend P = 0.001). Improvement in overall QOL was not
      statistically significantly different between the 3 groups (P = 0.86). However,
      QOL improvement was the greatest with EEN in the body image (P = 0.03) domain and
      with anti-TNF in the emotional domain (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although PEN
      improved clinical symptoms, EEN and anti-TNF were more effective for decreasing
      mucosal inflammation and improving specific aspects of QOL.

PG  - 411-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 
      stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with
      IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review 
      was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney
      Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in
      this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a
      significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points
      compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 
      months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no 
      significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any
      time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and
      maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with
      IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and
      establish whether this intervention has other benefits.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-138
LID - 10.3310/hta19260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition has been shown to be a viable treatment
      option for the management of active Crohn's disease (CD), the evidence regarding 
      its clinical benefits compared with standard treatments (e.g. steroids) for
      maintaining remission in patients with CD has been inconsistent. If enteral
      nutrition was to be effective, the use of drugs such as steroids and
      immunosuppressive drugs could be reduced, thereby reducing the likelihood of
      adverse events associated with these medications. OBJECTIVES: This systematic
      review aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
      elemental nutrition (a type of enteral nutrition) for maintenance of remission in
      patients with CD. DATA SOURCES: Major bibliographic databases (e.g. MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were searched from inception to 
      August/September 2013. Searches were not limited by study design, language or
      publication date. Websites for relevant organisations and references of included 
      studies were checked. METHODS: Experimental randomised and non-randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs and nRCTs) reporting clinical effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition in the maintenance of remission in
      patients with CD were eligible. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias
      (RoB) assessment were performed independently. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean
      differences (MDs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was
      assessed via forest plots, Cochran's Q and the I2 statistics. Overall, quality of
      evidence for each outcome was rated using the Grading of Recommendations,
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Eight studies (three
      RCTs and five nRCTs) were included in the review. RCTs indicated a significant
      benefit of elemental nutrition vs. no intervention (an unrestricted diet) in
      maintaining remission at 24 months [one RCT; RR 2.06, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 1.00 to 4.43; very low-grade evidence] and preventing relapse at 12-24
      months post baseline (two RCTs; pooled RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84; I2 = 0%;
      high-grade evidence). Similarly, three nRCTs showed significant benefits of
      elemental nutrition over no intervention in maintaining remission at 12-48 months
      and preventing relapse at 12 months post baseline (MD 1.20 months, 95% CI 0.35 to
      2.04 months). The incidence of mucosal healing was not significantly different in
      the intervention and control groups (RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 11.72). Adherence to
      an elemental nutrition regime was significantly worse than adherence to polymeric
      nutrition (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92) and, when compared with other active
      treatments (medications, polymeric nutrition or a combination), elemental
      nutrition yielded non-significant results with wide 95% CIs, rendering these
      results inconclusive. Complications and adverse events were too sparse to allow
      meaningful comparisons. None of the studies reported cost-effectiveness of
      elemental nutrition. Owing to scarcity of data, subgroup and sensitivity analyses
      could not be performed to explore methodological and clinical sources of
      heterogeneity. LIMITATIONS: The findings warrant cautious interpretation given
      the limitations of the evidence in methodological quality (small samples, short
      follow-up) and the RoB in individual studies (lack of blinding, confounding).
      CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence indicates potential benefits of elemental nutrition
      against no intervention in the maintenance of remission and prevention of relapse
      in adult patients with CD. There was a lack or insufficient evidence on adverse
      events and complications. Future large and long-term randomised trials are
      warranted to draw more definitive conclusions regarding the effects of elemental 
      nutrition in maintaining remission in CD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is
      registered as PROSPERO CRD42013005134. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health
      Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

TI  - Consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 623-30
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000330 [doi]
AB  - To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we
      carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search 
      was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were
      calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel
      plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On 
      the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables
      was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95%
      CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI
      0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely
      with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95%
      CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD,
      subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in
      Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). 
      No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of
      vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of 
      vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of
      vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD,
      and the results need to be further confirmed.

TI  - New therapeutic option for irritable bowel syndrome: serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin.
PG  - 3361-6
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i11.3361 [doi]
AB  - Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are 
      also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical
      practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been
      shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as
      well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients 
      with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency
      virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS
      patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual
      physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7
      IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; 
      also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87
      years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard
      care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with
      the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of
      improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the
      prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two
      patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of
      insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall
      improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as
      well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In 
      most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of
      therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted 
      mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein
      source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and
      nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal
      epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with 
      IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.

TI  - Whey and soy protein supplements changes body composition in patients with
      Crohn's disease undergoing azathioprine and anti-TNF-alpha therapy.
PG  - 1603-10
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.4.8362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause. Malnutrition associated with active CD
      has been reduced although obesity has increased. Dietary strategies such as those
      with high-protein have been proposed to reduce body fat. This study compares the 
      effects of two supplements on the nutritional status of CD patients. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: 68 CD patients were randomized in two groups: whey protein group
      (WP) and soy protein group (SP). Using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and
      albumin and pre-albumin dosages the nutritional status was measured before
      starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The disease activity was
      determined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum C-reactive protein dosage 
      and dietary intake by 24h dietary recalls. RESULTS: Forty-one patients concluded 
      the study and both supplements changed body composition similarly. Triceps skin
      fold thickness (p< 0.001) and body fat percentage (p=0.001) decreased, whereas
      mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.004), corrected arm muscle area (p=0.005) and
      body lean percentage (p=0.001) increased. CONCLUSIONS: For Crohn's disease
      patients undergoing anti TNF-alpha and azatioprine therapies, supplementation
      with whey and soy proteins changes body composition through reduction of body fat
      and thus contributes to control inflammation.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to
      arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a
      genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal
      inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation 
      and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been
      identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset
      and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize
      with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that
      the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular
      anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense
      mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary
      deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk
      factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in
      the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.

AB  - IBD, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic
      immunologically mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions
      between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Established high-prevalence
      populations of IBD in North America and Europe experienced the steepest increase 
      in incidence towards the second half of the twentieth century. Furthermore,
      populations previously considered 'low risk' (such as in Japan and India) are
      witnessing an increase in incidence. Potentially relevant environmental
      influences span the spectrum of life from mode of childbirth and early-life
      exposures (including breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure in infancy) to
      exposures later on in adulthood (including smoking, major life stressors, diet
      and lifestyle). Data support an association between smoking and Crohn's disease
      whereas smoking cessation, but not current smoking, is associated with an
      increased risk of ulcerative colitis. Dietary fibre (particularly fruits and
      vegetables), saturated fats, depression and impaired sleep, and low vitamin D
      levels have all been associated with incident IBD. Interventional studies
      assessing the effects of modifying these risk factors on natural history and
      patient outcomes are an important unmet need. In this Review, the changing
      epidemiology of IBD, mechanisms behind various environmental associations and
      interventional studies to modify risk factors and disease course are discussed.

AB  - AIM: To assess knowledge acquired by adolescents about their inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was given during consultation 
      to adolescents followed for IBD by pediatricians from 13 hospitals between 1
      September 2012 and 1 July 2013. After parental consent, these physicians
      completed a form at the inclusion of each patient, in which the characteristics
      of IBD were detailed. The patients mailed back their questionnaire. RESULTS: A
      total of 124 patients from 12 to 19 years of age were included with a response
      rate of 82% (all anonymous); 23% of the patients thought that diet was a possible
      cause of IBD and 22% that one of the targets of their treatment was to cure their
      disease for good. Of the patients reported having Crohn disease, 46% knew the
      anoperineal location and 14% knew that Crohn disease can affect the entire
      digestive tract. Twenty-five percent of the patients were able to name one side
      effect of azathioprine (88% had already received this treatment), 24% were able
      to name one side effect of infliximab (54% had already received this treatment), 
      70% of the adolescents knew that smoking worsens Crohn disease, 68% declared they
      had learned about their IBD from their pediatrician, and 81% said they would like
      to receive more information. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with IBD have gaps in their 
      general knowledge and the different treatments of their disease. Their main
      source of information is their pediatrician, warranting the implementation of
      customized patient education sessions.

TI  - A study evaluating the bidirectional relationship between inflammatory bowel
      disease and self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 847-53
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the associated use of a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) are perceived to belong to the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). However, recent reports suggest substantial use of a GFD in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). We assessed the bidirectional relationship between IBD and
      self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity (SR-NCGS). METHODS: A cross-sectional
      questionnaire screened for SR-NCGS and the use of a GFD in 4 groups: ulcerative
      colitis (n = 75), Crohn's disease (n = 70), IBS (n = 59), and dyspeptic controls 
      (n = 109). We also assessed diagnostic outcomes for IBD in 200 patients
      presenting with SR-NCGS. RESULTS: The prevalence of SR-NCGS was 42.4% (n = 25/59)
      for IBS, followed by 27.6% (n = 40/145) for IBD, and least among dyspeptic
      controls at 17.4% (n = 19/109); P = 0.015. The current use of a GFD was 11.9% (n 
      = 7/59) for IBS, 6.2% (n = 9/145) for IBD, and 0.9% (1/109) for dyspeptic
      controls; P = 0.02. No differences were established between ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. However, Crohn's disease patients with SR-NCGS were
      significantly more likely to have stricturing disease (40.9% versus 18.9%, P =
      0.046), and higher mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (228.1 versus 133.3,
      P = 0.002), than those without SR-NCGS. Analysis of 200 cases presenting with
      SR-NCGS suggested that 98.5% (n = 197) could be dietary-related IBS. However,
      1.5% (n = 3) were found to have IBD; such patients had associated alarm symptoms,
      and/or abnormal blood parameters, prompting colonic investigations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      SR-NCGS is not only exclusive to IBS but also associated with IBD, where its
      presence may be reflecting severe or stricturing disease. Randomized studies are 
      required to further delineate the nature of this relationship and clarify whether
      a GFD is a valuable dietetic intervention in selected IBD patients.

TI  - Can inflammatory bowel disease be permanently treated with short-term
      interventions on the microbiome?
PG  - 781-95
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2015.1013031 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by
      an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease
      remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal
      microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut
      microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both
      prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its
      growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that
      the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term
      interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic
      agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which
      then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on
      these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through
      short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient
      effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic
      options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota
      transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the
      alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.

TI  - High amount of dietary fiber not harmful but favorable for Crohn disease.
PG  - 58-61
LID - 10.7812/TPP/14-124 [doi]
AB  - Current chronic diseases are a reflection of the westernized diet that features a
      decreased consumption of dietary fiber. Indigestible dietary fiber is metabolized
      by gut bacteria, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, to butyrate, which has a
      critical role in colonic homeostasis owing to a variety of functions. Dietary
      fiber intake has been significantly inversely associated with the risk of chronic
      diseases. Crohn disease (CD) is not an exception. However, even authors who
      reported the inverse association between dietary fiber and a risk of CD made no
      recommendation of dietary fiber intake to CD patients. Some correspondence was
      against advocating high fiber intake in CD. We initiated a semivegetarian diet
      (SVD), namely a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. Our SVD contains 32.4 g of dietary fiber in 2000 kcal. There was no
      untoward effect of the SVD. The remission rate with combined infliximab and SVD
      for newly diagnosed CD patients was 100%. Maintenance of remission on SVD without
      scheduled maintenance therapy with biologic drugs was 92% at 2 years. These
      excellent short- and long-term results can be explained partly by SVD. The fecal 
      bacterial count of F prausnitzii in patients with CD is significantly lower than 
      in healthy controls. Diet reviews recommend plant-based diets to treat and to
      prevent a variety of chronic diseases. SVD belongs to plant-based diets that
      inevitably contain considerable amounts of dietary fiber. Our clinical experience
      and available data provide a rationale to recommend a high fiber intake to treat 
      CD.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition (EN) on the body composition 
      and metabolism in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Sixty-one patients
      diagnosed with CD were enrolled in this study. They were given only EN (enteral
      nutritional suspension, TPF, non-elemental diet) support for 4 wk, without any
      treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, infliximab or by
      surgical operation. Body composition statistics such as weight, body mass index, 
      skeletal muscle mass (SMM), fat mass, protein mass and inflammation indexes such 
      as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CD activity
      index (CDAI) were recorded before and after EN support. RESULTS: The 61 patients 
      were divided into three groups according to CDAI before and after EN support: A
      (active phase into remission via EN, n=21), B (remained in active phase before
      and after EN, n=19) and C (in remission before and after EN, n=21). Patients in
      group A had a significant increase in SMM (22.11+/-4.77 kg vs 23.23+/-4.49 kg,
      P=0.044), protein mass (8.01+/-1.57 kg vs 8.44+/-1.45 kg, P=0.019) and decrease
      in resting energy expenditure (REE) per kilogram (27.42+/-5.01 kcal/kg per day vs
      22.62+/-5.45 kcal/kg per day, P<0.05). There was no significant difference
      between predicted and measured REE in active CD patients according to the
      Harris-Benedict equation. There was no linear correlation between the measured
      REE and CRP, ESR or CDAI in active CD patients. CONCLUSION: EN could decrease the
      hypermetabolism in active CD patients by reducing the inflammatory response.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency predisposes to adherent-invasive Escherichia coli-induced
      barrier dysfunction and experimental colonic injury.
PG  - 297-306
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) colonization has been
      strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Environmental
      triggers such as vitamin D deficiency have emerged as key factors in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on AIEC infection-induced changes in vivo 
      and in vitro. METHODS: Barrier function was assessed in polarized epithelial
      Caco-2-bbe cells grown in medium with or without vitamin D and challenged with
      AIEC strain LF82. Weaned C57BL/6 mice were fed either a vitamin D-sufficient or
      -deficient diet for 5 weeks and then infected with AIEC, in the absence and
      presence of low-dose dextran sodium sulphate. Disease severity was assessed by
      histological analysis and in vivo intestinal permeability assay. Presence of
      invasive bacteria was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS:
      Caco-2-bbe cells incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 were protected against AIEC-induced
      disruption of transepithelial electrical resistance and tight-junction protein
      redistribution. Vitamin D-deficient C57BL/6 mice given a course of 2% dextran
      sodium sulphate exhibited pronounced epithelial barrier dysfunction, were more
      susceptible to AIEC colonization, and showed exacerbated colonic injury.
      Transmission electron microscopy of colonic tissue from infected mice
      demonstrated invasion of AIEC and fecal microbiome analysis revealed shifts in
      microbial communities. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that vitamin D is able to
      mitigate the deleterious effects of AIEC on the intestinal mucosa, by maintaining
      intestinal epithelial barrier homeostasis and preserving tight-junction
      architecture. This study highlights the association between vitamin D status,
      dysbiosis, and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Infliximab reverses inflammatory muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 419-28
LID - 10.1111/apt.13058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting or sarcopenia arising from chronic inflammation is
      found in 60% of patients with Crohn's disease. Transcriptional protein NF-kappaB 
      reduces muscle formation through MyoD transcription and increases muscle
      breakdown by proteolysis. AIM: As TNF is a potent activator of NF-kappaB, and
      anti-TNF agent infliximab (IFX) prevents NF-kappaB activation, to determine
      whether or not Crohn's patients treated with IFX gain muscle volume and strength.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective, repeated-measures cohort study in adult
      Crohn's disease patients with an acute disease flare. Patients were instructed
      not to vary diet or activity. Concomitant medications were kept stable. At week 1
      (pre-treatment), week 16 (post-IFX induction) and week 25 (post-first IFX
      maintenance dose), we assessed (i) MRI volume of quadriceps femoris at anatomical
      mid-thigh; (ii) maximal concentric quadriceps contractions strength at three
      specific speeds of contraction; (iii) physical activity by validated instrument
      (IPAQ); (iv) Three-day food record of intake and composition (food-weighing
      method); (v) Serum levels of IL6. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (58% female; mean
      age 33.2 +/- 10.7 years) were recruited. IFX increased muscle volume in both legs
      from baseline (right, 1505 cm(3) ) to week 25 (right, 1569 cm(3) ; P = 0.010).
      IFX also increased muscle strength in both legs from baseline (right 30 degrees
      /s, 184.8 Nm) to week 25 (right 30 degrees /s, 213.6 Nm; P = 0.002). Muscle
      volume gain correlated with male gender (P = 0.003). Significant gains in muscle 
      volume and strength were unrelated to prednisolone use. Serum IL6 levels
      decreased by week 25 (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: The anti-TNF agent infliximab
      reverses inflammatory sarcopenia in patients with Crohn's disease.

AB  - Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to
      systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a
      regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for
      clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation
      using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured 
      before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet
      interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three
      categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific
      diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that
      observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group
      compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other
      specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical
      trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and
      the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for
      having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.

TI  - Efficacy of concomitant elemental diet therapy in scheduled infliximab therapy in
      patients with Crohn's disease to prevent loss of response.
PG  - 1382-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important
      clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED)
      therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy
      can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate
      the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in
      patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal
      CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients
      were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and
      the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the
      basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the
      physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy
      of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With
      the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient
      characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was
      significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled
      IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for
      small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and
      ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the
      non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in
      maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in
      order to prevent LOR.

TI  - Emerging leadership lecture: Inflammatory bowel disease in Asia: emergence of a
      "Western" disease.
PG  - 440-5
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12859 [doi]
AB  - More than a decade ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rare in Asia. Today, 
      the importance of IBD in Asia is exemplified by its rapidly increasing incidence,
      complicated disease behavior, and substantial morbidity. In the first large-scale
      population-based epidemiologic study in Asia, the incidence of IBD varied from
      0.60 to 3.44 per 100,000. There has been a twofold to threefold increase in the
      incidence of IBD in several countries in Asia. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is more
      prevalent than Crohn's disease (CD), although CD incidence is rapidly increasing.
      A positive family history is much less common than in the West, as are
      extra-intestinal disease manifestations. Complicated and penetrating CD are
      common in Asia. These epidemiologic changes may relate to increased contact with 
      the West, westernization of diet, improved hygiene, increasing antibiotics use,
      or changes in the gut microbiota. Asian patients with CD have altered gut
      microbiota compared with their healthy counterparts and Caucasian CD subjects.
      Mucosa-associated microbiota in IBD may differ geographically. In a
      population-based case-control study, breast-feeding, having pets, and better
      sanitary conditions were protective of IBD, suggesting that childhood environment
      plays an important role in modulating disease development. Genetic factors also
      differ between Asians and Caucasians. Nucleotide oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) 
      and autophagy variants were not associated with CD, but tumor necrosis factor
      superfamily gene-15 polymorphisms were strongly associated with CD in East
      Asians. Research in Asia, an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead 
      to the discovery of critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of
      IBD.

TI  - JAK2 and AMP-kinase inhibition in vitro by food extracts, fractions and purified 
      phytochemicals.
PG  - 305-12
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00626g [doi]
AB  - We have identified a range of food phytochemicals that inhibit Janus Kinase 2
      (JAK2) and Adenosine Monophosphate Kinase (AMPK). A mutated and dysregulated form
      of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's
      disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested
      49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing
      hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The
      food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products,
      herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent
      inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and
      strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These
      fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of
      the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and
      regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is
      reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET
      assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition.
      Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several
      reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure 
      compounds activated AMPK in our assay.

TI  - Environmental factors in the relapse and recurrence of inflammatory bowel
      disease: a review of the literature.
PG  - 1396-405
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3437-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the
      epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, 
      psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses
      and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic
      tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition
      of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS:
      The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations
      between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and
      estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general
      antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels
      of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological
      interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has
      reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC,
      but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations
      between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required
      where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured,
      in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and
      doctors to help maintain remission.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      are two distinct disorders that share some clinical manifestations but have
      different diagnostic criteria. In this article, we reviewed the clinical data of 
      three children with EGID who later developed IBD. This study is a retrospective
      case note review that was conducted between 2007 and 2012. EGID seems to precede 
      IBD in some subsets of children in whom the diagnosis of IBD may take a few years
      to fully develop.

TI  - PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway as a target for Crohn's disease therapy (Review).
PG  - 10-6
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1981 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, 
      is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong 
      genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive
      mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut
      microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation 
      processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN
      pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's
      disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a
      wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of
      diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the
      subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive
      research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular
      assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against
      Crohn's disease.

PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3350-9 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism
      underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response
      to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial
      dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role
      in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease
      behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental
      risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and
      depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the
      risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared
      genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist.
      There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident
      disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few 
      controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results
      in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient,
      physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for
      rigorous studies of the external environment in disease pathogenesis and
      subsequent course.

TI  - Long-term therapeutic effectiveness of maintenance enteral nutrition for Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 276-80
LID - 10.1111/ped.12494 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term effectiveness of enteral nutrition for maintaining
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is poorly documented. The aim of this
      study was therefore to examine the long-term effectiveness of enteral nutrition
      with aminosalicylates as maintenance therapy for those in whom remission was
      primarily induced by total parenteral nutrition or exclusive enteral nutrition
      with aminosalicylates. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data for 58 pediatric
      patients with newly diagnosed CD during a median follow-up period of 50 months
      (range, 12-216 months). Data for remission-induced patients in whom enteral
      nutrition with aminosalicylates was used as maintenance therapy were analyzed
      with particular reference to time to first relapse and time to first intestinal
      surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-five (43.1%) of the patients relapsed with a median
      duration of remission of 32.4 months (range, 6-73.2 months). The cumulative rates
      of continuous remission were 0.88 (95%CI: 0.79-0.96) at 1 year, 0.73 (95%CI:
      0.61-0.85) at 2 years, and 0.52 (95%CI: 0.35-0.68) at 5 years. None of the
      patients received corticosteroids, immunomodulators or anti-tumor necrosis factor
      agents until relapse. Disease location had no impact on timing of relapse, but
      with regard to disease behavior there was a trend towards earlier relapse in
      patients with penetrating type. Only six of the 58 patients (10.3%) needed
      intestinal surgery. There was a trend towards need for surgery in patients with
      ileal disease and with stricturing type. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition therapy
      with aminosalicylates is effective for maintaining remission and decreasing the
      rate of intestinal surgery in pediatric CD.

LID - 10.5009/gnl13345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To analyze the effect of short-term supportive temporary partial
      enteral nutrition therapy for treating severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label study in pediatric patients with 
      CD (n=78) from January 2007 to December 2011. The CD patients were divided into
      three groups according to disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe).
      Seventeen patients with severe CD received short-term partial enteral nutrition
      (SPEN) in addition to their general diet for 4 weeks after the induction of
      remission with medical treatment. This SPEN group was further divided into two
      groups by age (<13 years, >/=13 years). Nutritional parameters and Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores were analyzed at the initial enrollment and
      following 1 year of treatment for all groups. RESULTS: Nutritional status
      improved substantially after 1 year of treatment in the severe CD group.
      Nutritional status in the SPEN group improved considerably more than that in the 
      non-SPEN group. Additionally, the <13-year-old group demonstrated better
      nutritional status improvement than the >/=13-year-old group. CONCLUSIONS: SPEN
      may be effective in pediatric patients with severe CD for improving nutritional
      status and moderating disease severity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify disease-related knowledge and information
      needs of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The 313 patients (Crohn
      disease: n = 169, colitis: n = 144) presenting to an outpatient gastroenterology 
      clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, were scored on
      their knowledge of Crohn disease and colitis and their information needs were
      assessed in the questionnaire. Patients with Crohn disease obtained a higher mean
      knowledge score than patients with colitis. The patients with Crohn disease had
      significantly higher scores about complications than patients with colitis. The
      patients with Crohn disease showed significantly higher mean scores relating to
      the patients' information needs than patients with colitis. The favorite topics
      of information needed were disease, medication, and diagnosis/operations. The
      patients with Crohn disease wanted more information than patients with colitis
      about medications used for treatment, daily life, and pregnancy. The
      effectiveness of the training and education given to patients can be maximized in
      this education system when the information about disease and medications for
      Crohn disease patients or information about disease and diet for colitis patients
      is primarily provided according to the degree of the patients' need for
      information.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

      interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD 
      ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic
      mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed
      using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree
      reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice
      expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were
      orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and
      proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene
      promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within
      HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6
      promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing
      various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and
      transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was
      confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent
      HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC
      colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in
      CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest
      that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and
      AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits,
      such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic
      marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.

TI  - Impact of Disease Activity on Resting Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in 
      Adult Crohn's Disease: A Prospective Longitudinal Assessment.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during 
      phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been
      reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our
      aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy
      expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. 
      REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score,
      C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed.
      RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had
      increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 
      5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not
      sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active
      disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body 
      composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared 
      with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and
      behavior.
