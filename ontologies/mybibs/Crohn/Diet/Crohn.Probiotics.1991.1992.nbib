TI  - Improved growth and disease activity after intermittent administration of a
      defined formula diet in children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 499-504
AB  - Growth failure is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's
      disease in childhood, occurring in up to 50% to 88% of affected patients.
      Previous studies have shown malnutrition to be the most likely cause of the
      decrease in height and weight velocities in these children. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the effect of an intermittent defined formula diet on
      growth and disease activity in children with Crohn's disease and growth failure. 
      Six Tanner stage I-II patients, mean age 13.6 years with height less than the 5th
      percentile or height velocity less than the 3rd percentile were enrolled in a
      1-year prospective study. An isotonic, hydrolyzed whey, medium-chain triglyceride
      formula was given by nocturnal nasogastric infusion at a caloric equivalent of
      50th percentile for age, as the exclusive nutrient source 1 out of 4 months
      during a 1-year period. A 2-week exclusion diet and a 2-week low-residue diet
      followed the defined formula diet before resuming the regular diet for 2 months. 
      Patients served as their individual control based on observations of at least 1
      year before the study. Height and weight velocity significantly increased.
      Prednisone intake significantly decreased, and significant improvement was seen
      in disease activity, albumin, and somatomedin C. The results indicate that an
      intermittent defined formula diet can improve growth failure and significantly
      decrease disease activity in children with Crohn's disease.

TI  - What do patients want to know about their inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 477-80
AB  - Being informed is not only a patient's right, it is also important in order to
      improve compliance and management. Apart from verbal consultations, informative
      material is often produced without prior analysis of what patients consider
      important to know. Patient information needs were defined in order to plan future
      educational programmes. A 44-item questionnaire was given to 100 Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease (IBD) out-patients (50 Crohn's Disease (CD) and 50 Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC). Sixty-two per cent of those with UC and 78% of those with CD
      consider themselves insufficiently informed about their disease. CU and CD
      patients indicated different priorities concerning areas where further
      information is requested: CD patient needs were aetiology, diet, symptoms,
      history, new treatments, risks deriving from treatment, cancer risk and
      consequences on work. UC patients indicated a different priority order: risk of
      cancer, new treatments, symptoms, psychological and diet factors and aetiology.
      The media preferred by patients were: specifically prepared books (73%),
      video-cassettes (20%) and leaflets (25%). Ninety per cent think that educational 
      material prepared according to their needs could be very useful; however 35%
      think that knowledge of the possible severity of their disease might increase
      their anxiety.

PG  - 411-6
AB  - Growth retardation and delayed puberty occur in 20-35% of children and
      adolescents with Crohn's disease. Alternate day corticosteroid treatment, use of 
      azathioprine, enteral or parenteral hyperalimentation and surgery have been
      advocated to reverse growth failure. Because of nonacceptance of elemental diet 7
      patients with Crohn's disease and growth retardation received parenteral
      nutrition for 2-3 months (maximal for more than 30 months in one patient). All of
      them exhibited a mean weight gain of 10 kg and a mean increase of their height
      velocity from 2.4 to 7.1 cm/year. Main problems were bacterial infections and
      dislocations of the central lines. Surgery was performed in 3 adolescents
      immediately after parenteral nutrition. One patient showed a catch-up growth
      during a 30-months nocturnal home parenteral nutrition at a biological age of 21 
      years. Parenteral nutrition is an effective regimen to manage growth failure in
      children with Crohn's disease, but has to be performed for larger periods in
      individual cases.

TI  - [Prevalence of bone decalcification in the treatment of Crohn's disease].
PG  - 945-51
AB  - In clinically active Crohn's disease the bone mineralization is impaired due to
      calcium malabsorption by the inflamed intestinal wall which is potentiated by
      diarrhoea and the thus accelerated transit time. To this we must add the
      shortening of the gut after operations, the inadequate dietary calcium supply or 
      possibly calcium elimination in case of concurrent lactose intolerance. Corticoid
      treatment leads also to deterioration of bone mineralization. This is the reason 
      why the authors assessed in 98 patients with Crohn's disease the bone
      mineralization, using the method of clavicular bone index (NIBA). Then treatment 
      was started: a high protein diet, calcium forte, Ossin (sodium fluoride), vitamin
      D forte, anabolics and regular physical exercise. Check-up examinations after one
      year revealed that the index was restored in the majority of patients (60.84%) to
      normal. The above treatment is thus effective. It must be, however, regular and
      of a long-term character, in some patients it must extend over many years. We
      had, however, also patients who although subjected to an extensive resection of
      the gut and treated for prolonged periods with corticoids, had permanently an
      index between 100 and 120% without treatment.

TI  - Lipocortin-present perforating and lipocortin-absent nonperforating Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 341-4
AB  - To investigate whether Crohn's disease has two different clinical forms, a
      relatively aggressive perforating type and a more indolent nonperforating type,
      we compared the concentrations of lipocortin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the
      inflamed mucosa of 12 patients with strictly controlled Crohn's disease with
      those found in histologically normal mucosa of control subjects. The inflamed
      mucosa obtained from eight patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease did not
      react with antilipocortin antibody on immune blot analysis. In contrast, the
      inflamed mucosa from four patients with perforating Crohn's disease, as well as
      that obtained from histologically normal controls, contained lipocortins. In
      addition, higher concentrations of intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 were found
      in patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease (902 +/- 454 pg/wet weight [WW]
      mg and 1,268 +/- 567 pg/WW mg, respectively) compared with normal controls (90.2 
      +/- 43.1 pg/WW mg and 173 +/- 76.5 pg/WW mg, respectively) (p less than 0.01).
      The difference in intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 levels between patients
      with perforating Crohn's disease (109.6 +/- 16.7 pg/WW mg and 252 +/- 34.4 pg/WW 
      mg, respectively) and normal controls was not significant. These findings
      indicate that there may be two distinct patterns of Crohn's disease that differ
      in the amount of lipocortin present in the intestinal mucosa.

      in children].
PG  - 284-7
AB  - Crohn's disease plays an important role in children's pathology. There is an
      increase in its incidence last decades. The etiology of Crohn's disease isn't yet
      known. The aim of therapy is to induce remission of the symptoms and disease's
      activity. Drug treatment as well as surgical procedures according to the
      side-effects and short-lasting effect have not shown to be satisfactory so far.
      Very important feature of Crohn's disease is growth retardation as well as
      puberty delay what is even emphasized by corticosteroid therapy which these
      children are quite long on. Recent research has shown that an elemental diet is
      as effective as corticosteroid therapy in inducing remission. Its positive effect
      on growth has been especially emphasized. It is not still certain how the
      elemental diet acts. It is supposed that its useful effects are achieved by its
      complete absorption without the need for extra digestion, by bowel rest,
      hypoallergenicity, changing in intestinal microflora, by caloric intake and
      reducing protein exudation by a direct influence on the mucosa of the small
      intestine. Because of all previously mentioned the elemental diet is recommended 
      as a treatment of choice, especially for the nonstenositing features of Crohn's
      disease of the small intestine.

      intestinal resection.
PG  - 755-60
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether fluid homeostasis could be
      maintained by using a hypo-osmolar (200 to 221 mosmol/kg), relatively low-sodium 
      (50 to 52 mmol/liter) solution that contained a glucose polymer in a 54-year-old 
      patient with high ileostomy output attributed to short-gut syndrome and resultant
      prerenal azotemia. Sequential balance studies were performed to assess stool and 
      urinary output, stool fat, and urinary electrolytes initially during intravenous 
      rehydration and subsequently during administration of the necessary fluids and
      nutrients exclusively by oral supplementation. The additional effects of high-fat
      and low-fat diet, loperamide hydrochloride, and octreotide acetate were
      evaluated. When the patient sipped a hypo-osmolar oral rehydration solution while
      she was awake during the day and received a high dose of loperamide and a 40-g
      fat, disaccharide-free diet, salt and water homeostasis was maintained. The
      addition of octreotide did not substantially enhance fluid balance; rather, it
      increased fecal fat and fluid losses from the small bowel. Thus, hypo-osmolar
      polymeric glucose solutions maintain fluid homeostasis in patients with the
      short-gut syndrome. In such patients, simple balance studies are useful for
      assessing the absorptive capacity of the residual intestine, for developing an
      optimal individualized treatment, and for eliminating the need for costly,
      long-term home parenteral nutrition.

TI  - [Possibilities and limitations of nutritional support in Crohn disease].
PG  - 161-5
AB  - Crohn's disease involves a great risk of malnutrition. Malabsorption, bacterial
      contamination, frequent abdominal surgery, meal-related pain, protein loss
      through the damaged mucosa contribute to creating nutritional problems.
      Malnutrition can worsen the outcome, both in medical and surgical patients, and
      deteriorate an often already altered immune response. Weight loss, low levels of 
      blood protein, electrolytes, micronutrients and vitamins are usually related to
      the extension of the mucosal damage. Nutritional assessment can be difficult due 
      to oedema and bleeding, who interfere with both clinical and laboratory
      evaluation. The exact amount of nitrogen, lipids, minerals stool loss can be
      useful. It is widely accepted the use of nutritional support in Crohn's disease, 
      but many Authors do not agree concerning the route (enteral or parenteral) and
      the kind of nutrient to be used. Still controversial is the role of nutrition:
      just support or real therapy? Most recent hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis 
      of Crohn's disease indicate food and/or bacterial antigens as involved in
      determining the pathology. The "bowel rest", considered for many years as a
      fasting period necessarily supported by parenteral nutrition, can also be
      obtained by the temporarily reduction or stop in presenting those antigens to the
      bowel mucosa. This new concept can be achieved not only by parenteral nutrition, 
      but with an enteral elemental diet as well. The elemental diet contains all
      nutrients in the simplest way and thus succeeds in lowering or eliminating the
      antigenic power. The reported results seem to indicate an equivalence of enteral 
      and parenteral nutrition; anyway enteral is advisable when feasible, being more
      physiological and less expensive and involving a lower risk of serious
      complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - About 20% of patients with active Crohn's disease do not respond to
      acute-phase-therapy with glucocorticoids at an initial dose of 60 mg
      prednisolone-equivalent and stepwise dose reduction every week. In case of
      primary failure of this therapeutic scheme the dose of glucocorticoids has to be 
      enhanced. If necessary a combination with total parenteral nutrition or tube
      feeding should be used. In case of early recurrence of inflammation during dose
      reduction or chronic steroid-dependent disease activity a combination of
      glucocorticoids with Azathioprine will be successful in about 75% of patients. In
      addition a combination of glucocorticoids with tube feeding (elemental or
      polymeric diet) will lead to remission of inflammatory activity in about 60 to
      70% of these patients. In patients, who are still refractory to these therapeutic
      procedures, operation should be discussed.

TI  - Whole body protein turnover in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - 675-7
AB  - In order to investigate the effects of treatment on protein metabolism in
      childhood Crohn's disease whole body protein turnover was measured using a primed
      constant intravenous infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine and mass spectrometry in 10
      children with active disease. Mean rates of protein synthesis and breakdown
      markedly decreased after treatment with steroids (four) or an elemental diet
      (six). This suggests that protein synthesis and breakdown are increased during
      active Crohn's disease in children and are reduced after induction of remission
      regardless of the type of treatment.

TI  - Orthognathic surgery in patients with Crohn's disease: a review of the
      pathophysiology and perioperative management.
PG  - 502-5
AB  - The patient with Crohn's disease poses an interesting challenge to the oral and
      maxillofacial surgeon contemplating orthognathic surgery. Elective surgery should
      be limited to periods of disease remission. Even in a quiescent state, however,
      this disease requires careful perioperative management. Special attention must be
      paid to the patient's diet and maintenance medications. Often these patients have
      required long-term corticosteroid therapy, which, in addition to increasing
      surgical and anesthetic risk, has the potential to adversely affect bone healing.
      This article presents a review of the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease and
      discusses the perioperative and postoperative concerns associated with this
      disease.

      disease. New formulations which attempt to lower the rates of side effects are
      under evaluation. The value of azathioprine has been established in ulcerative
      colitis and cyclosporin has been shown to be of value. Dietary therapy in Crohn's
      disease has been the focus of a large amount of research and benefits have been
      demonstrated. New therapies including bioengineered drugs are anticipated.

TI  - A randomized prospective trial comparing a defined formula diet, corticosteroids,
      and a defined formula diet plus corticosteroids in active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 328-33
AB  - Although defined formula diets may be useful for initial episodes of Crohn's
      disease, the effects of these diets on subsequent attacks of Crohn's disease or
      in conjunction with corticosteroids are unknown. To evaluate these issues, we
      studied 27 patients in a randomized prospective trial. Ten patients received only
      prednisone (group I), nine received only a defined formula diet (Vital HN [high
      nitrogen]) (group II), and eight received a combination of prednisone and Vital
      HN (group III). At the time of entry into the study, the groups were similar with
      respect to age, sex, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, previous and current
      treatments, anatomic site of disease, and nutritional status. After 1 month of
      treatment, we noted seven successes (70%) and three failures in group I
      (prednisone only), three successes (33%) and six failures in group II (Vital HN
      only), and six successes (75%) and two failures in group III (combination
      therapy). Four patients randomized to receive only Vital HN were unable or
      unwilling to tolerate the defined formula diet. Of the five patients who were
      able to take the defined formula diet for 1 month, however, three (60%) were
      successfully treated. The patients who received prednisone (groups I and III)
      responded better than did the patients who received only the defined formula
      diet. These results may be attributable to the use of a nonelemental diet or the 
      treatment of patients who were not experiencing an initial attack of Crohn's
      disease or who had previously received corticosteroids. The expensive and often
      poorly tolerated defined formula diets should not be considered as a substitute
      for standard therapy with corticosteroids in Crohn's disease.

AB  - Patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases may require long-term parenteral 
      nutrition. The authors describe a case in which a subendocardial abscess
      developed in the right atrium in association with staphylococcal septicemia. The 
      patient, a 15-year-old boy, had a malpositioned Silastic catheter, the tip of
      which was in his right atrium. Staphylococcal abscess of the heart has been
      described previously after cardiac surgery, but the authors believe this is the
      first reported case related to a central venous catheter.

TI  - The effect of dietary yeast on the activity of stable chronic Crohn's disease.
PG  - 196-200
AB  - The effect of dietary yeast on the activity of stable Crohn's disease was
      assessed in 19 patients. During the 1st month patients continued their usual diet
      (base-line period), but during the next 2 months dietary yeast was excluded
      except that during 1 month patients took baker's yeast capsules while for the
      other month they took placebo capsules. The patients' mean Pettit Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) while taking baker's yeast (mean, 107.9; SE, 6.1) was
      significantly greater than during yeast exclusion (mean, 102.1; SE, 5.7; p less
      than 0.05). The mean of each patient's maximum CDAI during yeast exclusion (mean,
      107.1; SE, 5.7) was significantly lower than those during the base-line (mean,
      115.2; SE, 6.1; p less than 0.05) and baker's yeast inclusion periods (mean,
      113.9; SE, 6.7; p less than 0.05). Patients with elevated yeast antibodies tended
      to develop a higher CDAI while receiving baker's yeast (13 of 15). These results 
      suggest that dietary yeast may affect the activity of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease: current status and future
      directions.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally 
      (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also 
      as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of 
      remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when
      compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and
      preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the
      preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or
      superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets 
      for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an
      elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in
      acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than
      polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel 
      rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal
      nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support
      achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's
      disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients
      with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective
      therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term
      remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective
      evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal
      nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal
      nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly
      retard production of inflammatory mediators.

PG  - 254-60
AB  - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses the disease entities,
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). An aetiologic agent has not yet
      been defined and the diagnosis is based, therefore, on the sum of clinical,
      paraclinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histopathologic features. In recent
      years pathogenetic studies have focused on immune mechanisms, transmissible
      infectious agents, the potential role of the normal intestinal flora, dietary
      factors, enzymatic alterations and genetic features, in addition to vascular,
      neuromotor, allergic and psychologic factors. The corner stones in medical
      therapy of IBD are still corticosteroids and sulphasalazine (SAZ). The new oral
      salicylates, which are analogues of SAZ or "slow release" preparations of
      5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine), have provided a therapeutic progress, because
      they are tolerated better than SAZ. Immunosuppressive agents, such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, reduce the requirement for corticosteroids and
      are effective in refractory CD, but the effect is delayed up to several months.
      The therapeutic action of cyclosporine A is not sustained, but often associated
      with side effects. Metronidazole has a beneficial effect on perineal disease. The
      efficacy of antimycobacterial drugs, sodium-cromoglycate, lidocaine, clonidine
      and sucralfate has been reported only in optimistic case stories and small open
      trials. A diet, rich in omega-3-fatty acids, modifies leukotriene (LT)
      production, but its clinical efficacy is insufficient. The first
      anti-leukotriene-drug, zileuton, has recently been evaluated and a significant,
      although insufficient, clinical response was obtained by a 70 per cent inhibition
      of rectal LTB4 synthesis. Dietary therapy may be useful as an adjunct to
      treatment of local complications in CD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Diet and inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - We conducted a population-based case-control study of inflammatory bowel disease 
      and dietary habits in Stockholm during 1984-1987. We obtained retrospective
      information about food intake 5 years previously by a postal questionnaire for
      152 cases with Crohn's disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305
      controls. The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects who had
      a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative risk = 2.6, 95%
      confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased for subjects who had a high (15 
      gm or more per day) intake of fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval
      = 0.3-0.9). The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption of fast foods:
      the relative risk associated with consumption of fast foods at least two times a 
      week was estimated at 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease
      and 3.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis. Although
      coffee seemed to provide a protective effect for both diseases, there are reasons
      to consider this finding an artifact.

TI  - Malnutrition in Crohn's disease: substrate deficiency or misuse?
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Growth failure is frequently associated with Crohn's disease. However, it does
      not seem to be fully accounted for by overt endocrinological abnormalities or
      nutrient deficiencies. It may be related to an abnormal utilization of available 
      substrates, particularly proteins, due to an imbalance in protein metabolism
      kinetics. Its primary mechanism may be an increase in protein breakdown rates
      over synthesis, specifically related to the associated inflammatory syndrome, and
      progressively leading to a protein debt. Reduction in food intake would only
      exaggerate this trend by further reducing the synthesis to breakdown ratio,
      whereas nutrient supplementation merely compensates for the deficit by promoting 
      protein synthesis.

TI  - Controlled trial comparing two types of enteral nutrition in treatment of active 
      Crohn's disease: elemental versus polymeric diet.
PG  - 1492-7
AB  - To determine whether an elemental diet or a polymeric defined formula diet would 
      be more effective for treating active Crohn's disease, we conducted a prospective
      randomised clinical trial in 30 patients with active Crohn's disease unresponsive
      to steroids and/or complicated by malnutrition. They received a four to six week 
      enteral nutrition course with either an elemental diet or a polymeric diet.
      Clinical remission occurred in 10 of the 15 patients on elemental diet compared
      with 11 of the 15 patients assigned to polymeric diet. Both groups showed similar
      improvements in nutritional status, biological inflammation, alpha 1 antitrypsin 
      clearance, and colonoscopic lesions (diminished in 17 out of 24 patients). Most
      patients relapsed during the year after discharge. We conclude that enteral
      nutrition, whatever the diet, is an efficient primary therapy for active Crohn's 
      disease but does not influence the long term outcome.

AB  - Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease who had symptoms uncontrolled by high-dose 
      steroids (n = 11) or symptoms invariably appearing on reduction or withdrawal of 
      immunosuppressive therapy (n = 5) were treated with elemental diet. After 4 wk of
      dietary treatment, 10 patients were in remission and off all medication. Seven
      continued to be well without treatment for a minimum of 6 months, and four for at
      least 1 yr. No patient who subsequently relapsed had further steroid-refractory
      symptoms. Of the six patients failing to respond to elemental diet, four with
      steroid-refractory disease required early resective surgery for symptom relief,
      and two continued with steroid therapy, one in much reduced dosage. Elemental
      diet can bring about a sustained remission in many patients with Crohn's disease 
      dependent on or refractory to corticosteroids, and reduce the need for surgical
      intervention.

AB  - Multimodality and differentiated treatment of small-intestinal diseases is to
      combine methods of etiological action with pathogenetic treatment of the main
      clinical syndromes: chronic diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, hypercatabolic
      exudative enteropathy. Each nosological form should be treated specifically.
      Pathogenetic treatment involves diet therapy, chemotherapeutic correction of
      metabolic processes (vitamin administration, recovery of normal protein and lipid
      metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, anemia), management of chronic
      diarrhea. Treatment regimens are specified for gluten enteropathies, total
      variable immunodeficiency, Whipple disease, small-intestinal diverticulosis,
      Crohn's disease, amyloidoses, intestinal lymphoma and retroperitoneal lymph
      nodes. Clinical experience justifies the above methods as highly effective.

      sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect
      to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The
      severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups
      [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11].
      Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41
      patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2
      test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in
      the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 
      0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a
      subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed
      separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However,
      no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of
      either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less
      effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in
      treating active Crohn's disease.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of fasting, self-selected meals and isocaloric
      oral glucose and fat meals and intravenous (i.v.) feeding on plasma zinc
      concentrations in men. Plasma zinc remained stable when volunteers fasted all
      day, but self-selected meals and 600 kCal of dextrose or fat emulsion caused
      significantly reduced plasma zinc concentrations [mean (SD) 12.1 (1.4), 12.3
      (0.6) and 12.2 (0.7) mumol/L at 1400 h, respectively, compared with a fasting
      level of 13.9 (1.6) mumol/L at 0800 h, P less than 0.05]. In patients undergoing 
      intravenous hyperalimentation, plasma zinc decreased from 12.0 (1.4) mumol/L at
      0800 h to 10.0 (1.1) mumol/L at 1400 h [mean (SD), P less than 0.01]. These data 
      show that both enteral and i.v. feeding cause a decline in plasma zinc and that
      glucose alone is not responsible for this post-prandial fall since ingestion of
      isocaloric amounts of glucose or fat have a similar effect.

TI  - Elemental diet in the management of Crohn's disease during pregnancy.
PG  - 1079-81
AB  - Four patients with Crohn's disease were treated with an elemental diet during
      pregnancy. Two had active disease and two also had symptoms of small intestinal
      obstruction. All went into a clinical remission within a few days of starting
      treatment. Treatment periods varied from two to four weeks, and were followed by 
      elemental diet as a supplement to normal food in two patients. At term, all
      delivered a healthy infant. These patients indicate that elemental diet is a safe
      form of treatment for Crohn's disease during pregnancy and may be considered as
      an alternative to conventional drug treatments which carry a theoretical risk of 
      teratogenesis.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: primary health care management of ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 27-30, 35-6, 38-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, two conditions so alike clinically that they are frequently
      indistinguishable from one another. Inflammatory bowel disease occurs at a rate
      of approximately five per 100,000 people. It tends to cluster in families and is 
      seen four to five times more often in Jewish Caucasians than in other Caucasians.
      The etiology is unknown. Increasing attention is being paid to autoimmune
      factors, genetic factors and food allergies, and the notion that inflammatory
      bowel disease has its roots in a psychological disorder continues to pale for
      want of empirically sound evidence. Disease pattern is one of remission and
      exacerbation. The aim of therapy is to maintain an optimal lifestyle in remission
      through an individually tailored protocol of medications. Sulfasalazine remains
      the medication of choice; corticosteroids have short-term utility in
      exacerbation; and immunosuppressants, though controversial, are thought to have
      some steroid-sparing benefits during acute flare-ups. Indications for surgery
      vary, depending on whether or not a clear differential diagnosis has been made
      between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There is no cure for inflammatory
      bowel disease except for total colectomy in clearly diagnosed ulcerative colitis.
      Current research endeavors seek a cause or causes for inflammatory bowel disease,
      but the literature does not solidly support any one possibility above other rival
      etiologies.

TI  - The effect of elemental diet on intestinal permeability and inflammation in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 84-9
AB  - This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental 
      diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled
      ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) permeability test and the fecal
      excretion of 111In-labeled autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four
      patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an 
      elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal
      permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 
      0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of
      111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven
      (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. 
      After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine
      excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal
      excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such
      treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which
      elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the
      intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical
      explanation for some relapses of the disease.

TI  - Mucosal and systemic IgA anti-gliadin antibody in celiac disease. Contrasting
      patterns of response in serum, saliva, and intestinal secretions.
PG  - 743-51
AB  - Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody estimation is a recognized screening method for
      celiac disease. However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal
      disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA
      anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity
      than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum,
      salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody
      were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N =
      20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in
      treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal
      aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA
      anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in
      controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was
      not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin 
      antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting
      untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where 
      it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet.
      Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be
      compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract
      functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that
      serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control.

TI  - Review article: dietary and nutritional management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 211-26
AB  - The value of dietary alteration and the nutritional management of Crohn's disease
      is assessed in this review. Lactose restriction, low-fat diets and low-residue
      diets may be of value in specifically indicated clinical situations. A
      fibre-rich, unrefined carbohydrate diet has not been shown to alter the course of
      the disease, and the value of 'exclusion diets' remains to be confirmed in
      controlled, prospective studies. Nutritional insufficiency of varying degrees is 
      common in Crohn's disease and can be corrected by the efficient use of enteral
      diets (usually with polymeric preparations) or intravenous nutritional support.
      Growth retardation in adolescents with Crohn's disease can usually be improved by
      enteral nutrition. Nutritional support of various kinds may be of value in the
      management of local complications of Crohn's disease; sub-acute obstruction,
      anal, perianal and rectal lesions, fistulas and ileostomy complications, and the 
      management of bile acid-induced diarrhoea. The use of nutrition as 'primary
      therapy; in Crohn's disease is considered. Theoretical reasons why nutritional
      support and bowel rest may possibly induce remission of the disease are
      discussed. The evidence to date suggests that intravenous nutrition and bowel
      rest may not be effective in inducing a primary remission of the disease, and the
      possible value of elemental diets and polymeric diets in this respect are
      assessed. Further prospective controlled studies of elemental diets as primary
      therapy in Crohn's disease are required.

TI  - Enteral feeding as sole treatment for Crohn's disease: controlled trial of whole 
      protein v amino acid based feed and a case study of dietary challenge.
PG  - 702-7
AB  - A controlled trial was performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino 
      acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's
      disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic,
      and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients 
      randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within
      three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11
      treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then
      crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to
      the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared
      with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In
      responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l
      (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients
      relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine
      were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months).
      Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives
      were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing 
      small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment
      with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat,
      potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all
      reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a
      clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. Remission was
      rapidly achieved by switching back to the enteral feed but reintroduction of the 
      low residue diet that had been previously tolerated produced a brisk relapse.
      Clinical and biochemical remission was again achieved by a return to the enteral 
      feed but relapse again occurred with reintroduction of the low residue diet.
      These studies confirm the therapeutic effect of enteral feeding in Crohn's
      disease. This effect does not seem to be due to avoidance of whole protein, but
      the very low residue of chemically defined enteral feeds may be important,
      particularly in patients with intestinal strictures.

AB  - Basis treatment of severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease comprises the
      systemic administration of corticosteroids. If the conditions are less severe,
      treatment with oral sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) can be
      attempted. Distal ulcerative colitis may respond to topical corticosteroids of
      enemas with sulfasalazine or 5-ASA. In long-term treatment with high-dose
      corticosteroids, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may be employed to reduce the 
      corticosteroid requirement. There ist no known generally applicable diet for the 
      treatment or prophylaxis of these conditions.

TI  - Long-term effects of elemental and exclusion diets for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 115-25
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the therapeutic value of elemental diets in
      promoting remission in active Crohn's disease, but their long-term benefit has
      not been established. Twenty-seven patients with established Crohn's disease who 
      attained clinical remission after four weeks of enteral feeding were followed
      prospectively for up to 36 months. Twenty of these were willing to be tested for 
      specific food intolerance using a pre-defined dietary elimination protocol; the
      others continued on a normal unrestricted diet. Eighteen patients (67%) have
      since relapsed; 89% of the relapse occurred within the first 6 months. Of the 15 
      patients with colonic involvement, 12 (80%) relapsed by 6 months. In contrast
      only 3 of 11 with isolated small bowel disease experienced early relapse. Of the 
      14 patients who completed the process of dietary testing, 5 could not identify
      any trigger foods; the remaining 9 were maintained on exclusion diets, 3 of whom 
      relapsed early. Of the 11 taking a normal diet, 9 relapsed. Disease duration,
      previous intestinal resection or prior steroid therapy did not affect the relapse
      rate. Eight patients (31%) obtained a long-term remission, mean 23 months (range 
      12-36 months), without any medication. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained in
      about one-third of patients with Crohn's disease following treatment with a
      defined formula diet. Colonic involvement is associated with a high early relapse
      rate.

TI  - Nutritional support in Crohn's disease: which route?
PG  - 317-21
AB  - Nutritional and clinical responses to three nutritional regimens were
      retrospectively evaluated in 81 Crohn's patients with active disease. Group 1 (n 
      = 42) received a low residue oral diet, group 2 (n = 15) received chemically
      defined diets, and group 3 (n = 24), parenteral nutrition (PN). Weight gain was
      observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was 
      significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less 
      than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less
      than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal
      obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical
      remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1
      and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar.

TI  - [What is the role of nutrition in Crohn disease? A contribution to the importance
      of dietary therapy in regional enteritis].
PG  - 238-46
AB  - The clinical appearance of Crohn's disease (CD) is especially marked by
      nutritional deficits and insufficiencies. For a long time the goal of nutritional
      care was reduced to the readjustment of the nutritional status. The development
      and clinical use of controlled parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutritive
      solutions (EN) did not only emphasize this therapeutical issue, but furthermore
      showed positive effects on the conservative as well as on the surgical treatment 
      concepts. Therefore today artificial nutritional support is a firm part of
      therapy in acute, active phases or in the contact of surgical management of CD.
      This is especially valid in children, where complications in general and growth
      failure in particular can be reduced. EN is the preferred feeding method in most 
      of the cases, due to a lower complication rate and reduced cost when compared to 
      TPN. The question regarding the importance of nutritional support as primary
      therapy has also been investigated. The results differ extensively, but point
      towards the conclusion that patients with solitary small bowel disease do profit 
      from this therapeutical concept. Nevertheless it is unclear, how TPN or EN
      interfere in the pathophysiology or -biochemistry in this process. A question
      about reduction e.g. of allergic components of daily diet did stimulate new
      theories regarding the hypothesis of a possible causal relationship between diet 
      and the pathogenesis of CD. Investigations on dietary habits and daily dietary
      therapy did not reveal an overall accepted dietary guideline. Nevertheless it
      seems obvious that dietary counselling has a positive effect on the disease
      process. It does appear, that today in the acute, active phase as well as in the 
      long term management of Crohn's disease nutritional-care is an important
      therapeutical method.

TI  - The nutritional consequences of gastrointestinal disease in adolescence.
PG  - 91-102
AB  - The growth spurt of adolescence, during which body weight nearly doubles and
      height increases by 16%, demands an increased delivery of nutrients by the
      gastrointestinal tract. Chronic disorders of digestion and absorption at this
      age, therefore have a potentially profound effect upon growth, skeletal
      maturation and sexual development. Moreover, the emotional climate of
      adolescence, which requires affiliation with peer groups, and a distancing from
      authority figures such as doctors and parents, is often associated with a
      deterioration in drug and dietary compliance and with erratic clinic attendance. 
      Nutritional problems in adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis
      and coeliac disease are the most common. About one third of adolescents with
      Crohn's disease experience growth failure and delayed sexual development,
      probably as a consequence of long-term undernutrition. There is a strong argument
      for the care of these patients being in the hands of paediatric
      gastroenterologists. Enteral nutrition, often administered overnight, is
      successful in inducing catch-up growth, and reducing steroid dosage, although
      resection of diseased gut is often followed by good growth, and surgery should
      not be overlooked. Cystic fibrosis in adolescence is commonly complicated by
      protein-energy malnutrition. Pathogenesis includes anorexia, maldigestion and an 
      increase in resting energy expenditure. Malnutrition has been treated by a number
      of enteral regimens. In general, there is no place for repeated, short-term
      interventions of less than 6 months. Long-term studies have all shown good
      nutritional repletion and growth, but results with respect to improved
      respiratory function are conflicting. More prospective control trials are needed 
      before the precise indications for enteral nutrition in cystic fibrosis can be
      accurately defined. Once started it is difficult to stop, although preoperative
      treatment of patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation seems entirely
      appropriate. The major problem in the management of coeliac disease in
      adolescence is dietary compliance. Even those patients who claim to have good
      dietary compliance often have jejunal biopsy evidence of gluten ingestion and
      tend to be underweight. This is particularly worrying, as after 5 years adherence
      to a gluten free diet, the increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy appears 
      to return to normal.

PG  - 771-6
AB  - Two children with glycogen storage disease type 1B developed chronic inflammatory
      bowel disease. The first, a 7-year-old boy, had ileitis and later developed
      perianal disease. The second developed colitis by the age of 9 years; in both the
      features were consistent with Crohn disease. The children had neutropenia and
      neutrophil mobility defects characteristic of GSD-1B. It is suggested that these 
      neutrophil abnormalities are important in the pathogenesis of the bowel
      inflammation.
