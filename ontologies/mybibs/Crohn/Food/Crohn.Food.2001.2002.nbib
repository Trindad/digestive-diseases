TI  - Intestinal microflora as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - Although the causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain incompletely
      understood, increasing evidence implicates intestinal microflora in the
      pathogenesis of these disorders. Alteration of intestinal flora therefore may
      offer a plausible therapeutic approach. Although recent data support a potential 
      therapeutic role for probiotics and prebiotics in patients with IBD, such
      treatments need to be further assessed by large, double-blind controlled trials. 
      A better understanding of the intestinal microflora and the mechanisms of their
      action may help us to develop more effective treatment for IBD.

TI  - [Diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease: results from meta-analysis
      and randomized controlled trials].
PG  - 2041-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents
      current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects.
      Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative
      therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated.
      Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane
      Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials
      investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles 
      and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses
      investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-,
      semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to
      another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of
      corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets.
      Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis
      have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were
      identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary
      supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary
      supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary
      supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant
      positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which
      investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute 
      Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of
      severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising
      alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was
      not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to
      understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published
      trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for
      elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive
      effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot
      exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a 
      better presentation and understanding of these results.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor antagonist therapy and lymphoma development: twenty-six
      cases reported to the Food and Drug Administration.
PG  - 3151-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Etanercept and infliximab are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists 
      that have been recently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      and Crohn's disease (CD). This study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence
      of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients treated with these agents. METHODS: 
      Relevant data in the MedWatch postmarket adverse event surveillance system run by
      the US Food and Drug Administration were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 26
      cases of lymphoproliferative disorders following treatment with etanercept (18
      cases) or infliximab (8 cases). The majority of cases (81%) were non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas. The interval between initiation of therapy with etanercept or
      infliximab and the development of lymphoma was very short (median 8 weeks). In 2 
      instances (1 infliximab, 1 etanercept), lymphoma regression was observed
      following discontinuation of anti-TNF treatment, in the absence of specific
      cytotoxic therapy directed toward the lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Although data from a 
      case series such as this cannot establish a clear causal relationship between
      exposure to these medications and the risk of lymphoproliferative disease, the
      known predisposition of patients with RA and CD to lymphoma, the known excess of 
      lymphoma in other immunosuppressed populations, and the known immunosuppressive
      effects of the anti-TNF drugs provide a biologic basis for concern and
      justification for the initiation of additional epidemiologic studies to formally 
      evaluate this possible association.

PG  - S66-7
AB  - Antibiotics are often employed in the treatment of Crohn's disease, with
      interesting results. However indiscriminate suppression of intestinal bacteria
      may be harmful and long-term use of antibiotics is burdened by side-effects and
      by the risk of developing bacterial resistance. Manipulation of enteric flora
      with probiotic compounds would be a possible and appealing alternative. First aim
      of our study has been to investigate the efficacy of this probiotic in reducing
      the endoscopic recurrence rate or in reducing the severity of recurrent lesions
      at 1 year after surgery. Secondary goal has been the reduction of the clinical
      recurrence rate. Forty-five patients have been randomised to receive
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG or placebo for 12 months. The results have
      shown no differences in endoscopic and clinical remission between the two groups.

TI  - Use of Lactobacillus-GG in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - S63-5
AB  - The potential role of luminal bacteria in initiating the abnormal immune response
      seen in inflammatory bowel disease is stressed by many observations. A defect in 
      mucosal barrier function could allow luminal bacterial antigens to initiate the
      chronic relapsing inflammation in Crohn's disease. The potential role of luminal 
      bacteria in initiating the abnormal immune response seen in inflammatory bowel
      disease is stressed by many observations. A pilot study to investigate the
      possible effect of Lactobacillus GG in children with active Crohn's disease was
      conducted. Four male patients were enrolled, median age 14.5 years (range 10-18).
      In terms of clinical outcome, the patients showed significant improvement. In
      three patients on Lactobacillus GG, it was possible to taper the dose of
      steroids. Thus, although our data are obviously very preliminary, Lactobacillus
      GG appears to be effective in improving the clinical status of children with
      Crohn's disease. A multicentre study is currently being carried out in 7 US
      University centres in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to
      establish the efficacy of this probiotic in children with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Resident bacterial flora and immune system.
PG  - S37-43
AB  - The "controlled inflammation" of the normal human gut is a closely controlled
      phenomenon and any change in the cell type number and/or functions, including the
      release of soluble mediators can lead to an "uncontrolled" inflammation. The
      physiological inflammation in the human gut plays a crucial role in maintaining a
      local immune response that is appropriate, efficiently protective and which
      respects the gut structure and function. The intestinal mucosa represents a
      considerable proportion of the human immune system. Disregulation of the mucosal 
      immune response can switch a "controlled" toward an "uncontrolled" intestinal
      inflammation. A key role in the maintenance of an adequate balance between
      antigenic stimulation and host immune response is played by the immunoregulatory 
      molecules released by activated immunocytes in the human gut. The role of the
      host immune system in the maintenance of an adequate balance between luminal
      antigens, including the resident bacterial flora and host immune response, is
      strongly supported by animal models of uncontrolled intestinal inflammation.
      Besides the aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease, luminal antigens (including 
      food, viral and bacterial antigens) contribute to the maintenance of the
      inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease, by stimulating the
      immunocompetent cells in the intestinal mucosa. Of the luminal antigens, the
      resident bacterial flora seems to play a major role in the development of animal 
      models of "uncontrolled" intestinal inflammation. Recent evidence also suggest
      that bacterial flora can modulate the function of the intestinal mucosal cells.
      These observations support the role of the intestinal bacterial flora in the
      induction of an uncontrolled inflammation in the human gut, leading to tissue
      damage. Probiotics, defined as living micro-organisms which, when taken in
      appropriate amounts, improve the health status, have been proposed in the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, but their mechanisms of action still
      remain to be fully elucidated.

TI  - Gut mucosal response to food antigens in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1903-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food antigens may contribute to gut inflammation in Crohn's disease. 
      AIM: To assess in vivo sensitization to food antigens, ascertain whether
      sensitivity is gut specific, assess food sensitization in vitro, and correlate in
      vivo changes with histological and blood changes. METHODS: Skin testing and
      rectal exposure to six food antigens (cereal, cabbage, citrus, milk, yeast and
      peanut) and control saline were assessed double-blind by immediate and 3.5-h
      laser Doppler blood flowmetry, and rectal biopsies were taken. Peripheral blood
      lymphocyte proliferation was measured in response to the same antigens. RESULTS: 
      Ten patients with Crohn's disease and 10 healthy controls were studied. Blood
      flow increased in 24 of 60 antigen sites in Crohn's disease patients and six of
      60 antigen sites in controls (P < 0.0001) after 3.5 h. The Crohn's disease group 
      demonstrated higher rectal blood flow than controls in response to all food
      antigens, and this was significantly different for the responses to yeast (P =
      0.036) and citrus fruits (P = 0.038). Lymphocyte proliferation occurred in 32 of 
      60 tests in Crohn's disease patients and eight of 60 tests in controls (P <
      0.0001). There were no skin responses. Submucosal oedema corresponded to
      increased mucosal flow. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients demonstrate in vivo
      and in vitro sensitization to food antigens, which is gut specific. Mucosal
      flowmetry allows the identification of sensitization to gut antigens.

TI  - Increased mucosal tumour necrosis factor alpha production in Crohn's disease can 
      be downregulated ex vivo by probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in
      the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The effect of
      bacteria on TNF-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated. METHODS:
      Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with Crohn's disease
      (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy
      (caecal cancer). Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours
      with either non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, L
      bulgaricus LB10, or L crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no
      bacteria). Tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH) release and culture. Concentrations of TNF-alpha were measured in
      supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow
      cytometry. RESULTS: Coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release.
      Release of TNF-alpha by inflamed Crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced
      by coculture with L casei or L bulgaricus; changes induced by L crispatus or E
      coli were not significant. The effect of L casei and L bulgaricus was not
      prevented by protease inhibitors. Coculture with L casei and L bulgaricus reduced
      the number of CD4 cells as well as TNF-alpha expression among intraepithelial
      lymphocytes from Crohn's disease mucosa. None of the bacteria induced changes in 
      non-inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells 
      using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of
      proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  - N-3 fatty acids for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the literature relating to
      clinical studies of the use of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids in the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be
      related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of
      treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses
      used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to
      explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side 
      effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design,
      seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic 
      potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty
      acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing
      reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether
      this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated.
      Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of
      these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or
      when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as
      first choice.

TI  - Ineffectiveness of probiotics in preventing recurrence after curative resection
      for Crohn's disease: a randomised controlled trial with Lactobacillus GG.
PG  - 405-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Experimental studies have shown that luminal bacteria may be
      involved in Crohn's disease. Probiotics are a possible alternative to
      antibiotics. The aim of this randomised placebo controlled study was to determine
      if Lactobacillus GG, given by mouth for one year, could prevent Crohn's recurrent
      lesions after surgery or to reduce their severity. METHODS: Patients operated on 
      for Crohn's disease in whom all of the diseased gut had been removed were
      randomly allocated to receive 12 billion colony forming units of Lactobacillus or
      identical placebo for one year. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at the end of the
      trial or at the onset of symptoms. Endoscopic recurrence was defined as grade 2
      or higher of Rutgeerts scoring system. RESULTS: Eight of 45 patients were
      excluded from the trial (three for non-compliance and five for protocol
      violations). Clinical recurrence was ascertained in three (16.6%) patients who
      received Lactobacillus and in two (10.5%) who received placebo. Nine of 15
      patients in clinical remission on Lactobacillus (60%) had endoscopic recurrence
      compared with six of 17 (35.3%) on placebo (p=0.297). There were no significant
      differences in the severity of the lesions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Lactobacillus GG seems neither to prevent endoscopic recurrence at one year nor
      reduce the severity of recurrent lesions.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of enteral diet components on Crohn's disease-affected 
      tissues in vitro.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease
      treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat
      content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in
      the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether
      elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on
      colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies
      from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were
      incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino
      acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental
      diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete
      medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by
      bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
      and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's 
      disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at
      1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein
      resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0,
      p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue
      and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant
      increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen
      after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet
      incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's 
      disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid
      composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - Fat composition may be a clue to explain the primary therapeutic effect of
      enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease: results of a double blind randomised
      multicentre European trial.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fat has been suggested to determine the therapeutic effect of
      enteral diets in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the efficacy of two whole
      protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active
      Crohn's disease compared with steroids. METHODS: Sixty two patients with active
      Crohn's disease were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a
      polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate
      (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except
      for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%)
      (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly
      administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment
      failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical
      activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent
      predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis.
      RESULTS: Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for
      PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001;
      p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those
      patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis),
      remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 
      v PEN1). After adjusting for confounding variables, PEN1 remained significantly
      associated with a poor response. CONCLUSION: The type of dietary fat may be of
      importance for the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in active
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Pasteurization of milk and the heat resistance of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis: a critical review of the data.
PG  - 135-45
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) causes Johne's 
      disease in ruminants (including cattle, sheep and goats) and other animals, and
      may contribute to Crohn's disease in humans. This possibility, and the fact that 
      M. paratuberculosis may be present in raw milk, make it important to ensure that 
      the heat treatment specified for pasteurization of milk will give acceptable
      inactivation of this bacterium, with an adequate margin of safety. Published
      studies of the heat resistance of this bacterium in milk have given widely
      differing results. Possible reasons for these differences, and the technical
      problems involved in the work, are reviewed. It is concluded that there is a need
      (i) for the adoption of an agreed Performance Criterion for pasteurization of
      milk in relation to this bacterium, (ii) a need for definitive laboratory
      experiments to understand and determine the heat resistance of M.
      paratuberculosis, and (iii) a need for an assessment of whether the minimum heat 
      treatments specified at present for pasteurization of milk (Process Criteria)
      will meet the Performance Criterion for M. paratuberculosis. Measures are also
      required to ensure that commercial processes deliver continually the specified
      heat treatment, and to ensure that post-pasteurization contamination is avoided.

TI  - Modification of enteral diets in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity.
      Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease.
      However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional
      repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability 
      have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some
      evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing 
      cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased 
      intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been
      evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content 
      and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral
      diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the
      N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators
      derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be
      beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to
      enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific
      growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done
      to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies 
      for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Effect of composition of enteral nutrition on energy expenditure and CO2
      production during periods of average and excessive energy intake].
PG  - 298-301
AB  - UNLABELLED: The objective of the presented work is to evaluate to what extent the
      CO2 production and O2 utilization and energy metabolism at rest (REE) are
      influenced by an excessive nutrient intake and to what extent by the composition 
      of enteral nutrition. REE, CO2 production and O2 utilization were investigated in
      9 patients on complete enteral nutrition by indirect calorimetry in four
      modifications: I--nutrition with 40% kJ fat in a ration 1.2x the energy output at
      rest at the onset of the trial; II--40% kJ and high energy intake (2.4x energy
      output at rest; III--60% kJ fat in ration of 1.2x energy output at rest; IV--60% 
      kJ fat and energy intake 2.4x energy output at rest. At 40% (I) and 60% (III) fat
      content in a caloriocally adequate diet the energy output at rest, the CO2
      production and O2 utilization did not differ (mean +/- SD: 1438 +/- 264.1 kcal/24
      h, 179 +/- 31.6 nl/min, 209 +/- 38.1 ml/min vs. 1431 +/- 342.7, 190 +/- 54.2, 207
      +/- 46.5). Comparison of modifications II and IV revealed a significant (p <
      0.05) increase of CO2 production on a diet rich in carbohydrates (218 +/- 52.0
      vs. 202 +/- 42.3). The energy output at rest (1674 +/- 389.6 vs. 1661 +/- 378.7),
      nor O2 production (240 +/- 54.5 vs. 242 +/- 55.4) changed. Overfeeding with 40%
      fat (II) as compared with (I) led to a rise of the energy output at rest (p <
      0.05), O2 utilization (p < 0.05) and CO2 production (p < 0.01). Overfeeding with 
      lipids (IV) led as compared with III to a rise of the energy output at rest and
      O2 utilization; CO2 production did not change. CONCLUSION: The composition of
      enteral nutrition according to the described modification does not influences the
      energy output at rest, O2 utilization and CO2 production under conditions of an
      adequate energy intake. In case of an excessive nutrient intake nutrition with
      60% fat does not lead to an increase of CO2 production.

TI  - Review article: Crohn's disease--the role of nutritional therapy.
PG  - 48-52
AB  - Maintenance of adequate nutrition is of obvious importance in the management of
      patients with Crohn's disease. Exclusive parenteral nutrition can achieve high
      rates of remission, but this is not usually necessary since exclusive elemental
      and polymeric enteral regimes can yield similarly good results. Comparison of
      exclusive enteral formula feeding with steroid treatment favours steroids only
      because compliance is less complete for the restrictive nutritional regimes, and 
      formula feeds should always be the first choice in the growing child with active 
      Crohn's disease. It is probable that the nature of the lipid provided in Crohn's 
      diets is clinically important, and there is some evidence that the n-3 fatty
      acids are beneficial. Continuation of nutritional supplements once remission has 
      been obtained appears valuable even when malnutrition is not a major
      consideration.

TI  - Fine and ultrafine particles of the diet: influence on the mucosal immune
      response and association with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Crohn's disease is a modern Western disease characterised by transmural
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is of unknown aetiology, but
      evidence suggests that it results from a combination of genetic predisposition
      and environmental factors. Bacterial-sized microparticles (0.1-1.0 microm) are
      potent adjuvants in model antigen-mediated immune responses and are increasingly 
      associated with disease. Microparticles of TiO2 and aluminosilicate accumulate in
      macrophages of human gut-associated lymphoid tissue where the earliest signs of
      lesions in Crohn's disease are observed. Dietary microparticles are of endogenous
      or exogenous origin. Endogenous microparticles dominate and are calcium phosphate
      (most probably hydroxyapatite), which precipitates in the lumen of the mid-distal
      gastrointestinal tract due to secretion of Ca and phosphate in the succus
      entericus. Exogenous dietary microparticles are contaminants (soil and/or dust)
      and food additives. TiO2, for example, is a food colourant, and aluminosilicates 
      are anti-caking agents, although some aluminosilicates occur as natural
      contaminants. Food additives alone account for ingestion of approximately 10(12) 
      particles/person per d. Possible mechanisms for the role of exogenous and
      endogenous dietary microparticles in promoting toleragenic or immune responses of
      gastrointestinal mucosal phagocytosis are discussed. In a double-blind randomised
      pilot study we have shown that a diet low in Ca and exogenous microparticles
      appears to alleviate the symptoms of ileal Crohn's disease, with a significant
      (P= 0.002) improvement in the Crohn's disease activity index. A multi-centre
      trial and further mechanistic studies at the cellular level are underway.

      milk proteins in Behcet's disease and to distinguish any behaviour during active 
      or inactive disease. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 patients
      and from eight normal controls were cultured in the presence of
      phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, or chicken egg
      albumin. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 4 (IL4) were measured in the
      culture supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum samples 
      from 46 patients with Behcet's disease and from 37 healthy subjects were also
      studied for antibody detection. Antibodies to beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin,
      and chicken egg albumin were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: High IFNgamma but not 
      IL4 levels were found in the supernatants of lymphocytes from patients with
      active disease cultured in the presence of cow's milk proteins. Levels were
      comparable with those obtained in cultures stimulated with PHA. A significantly
      higher level of anti-beta-casein and anti-beta-lactoglobulin IgG and IgA
      antibodies was found in patients with active Behcet's disease. No relation was
      found between their occurrence and the age of the patients, the duration of
      disease, or the presence of gastrointestinal abnormalities. Antibodies to chicken
      albumin were detected at low levels and with a prevalence similar to that of
      healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that an active immune response
      occurs in Behcet's disease. This response involves an increased frequency of
      antibodies to cow's milk protein and a strong Th1 polarisation after exposure to 
      these antigens. The occurrence of these abnormalities supports a putative role
      for cow's milk proteins immune response in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease.

TI  - Lymphonodular hyperplasia of the terminal ileum associated with colitis shows an 
      increase gammadelta+ t-cell density in children.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently we reported a close association between lymphonodular
      hyperplasia (LNH) of the bulb of the duodenum and increased densities of
      intraepithelial gammadelta+ T-cells in subjects with untreated food allergies. In
      this study we sought to determine whether children with LNH of the terminal ileum
      (TI) show a similar correlation. METHODS: The mucosal specimens taken by
      colonoscopy from the TIs of 22 children with LNH of the TI without colitis, 13
      with right-sided colitis or pancolitis, nine with left-sided colitis, eight with 
      Crohn's disease, and three endoscopically healthy subjects were studied for
      T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies using a three-layer peroxidase staining
      method. RESULTS: LNH of the TI was found in 32 of the 55 subjects (58%). In 22 it
      was the only endoscopic finding, but in nine of 13 subjects (69%) it was related 
      to right-sided colitis or pancolitis. In patients with left-sided colitis or
      Crohn's disease it was diagnosed only rarely. In the whole study population, LNH 
      of the of the TI showed a significant association with the increment in the
      density of gammadelta+ T-cells. The subjects with LNH of the TI and colitis
      starting from the cecum showed the highest values, discriminating them
      statistically from any other study group. Accordingly their gammadelta+/CD3+
      ratio was high. Even in the subjects with LNH of the TI without colitis, the
      increment in gammadelta+ T-cells was significant as compared with the subjects
      with left-sided colitis. Upregulations of D-related expression on the mucosa of
      the TI were similar regardless of the presence of LNH or colitis or an increment 
      in gammadelta+ T-cells. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary observations showed increased
      densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T-cells and elevated gammadelta+/CD3+
      ratios in subjects with LNH on the mucosa of the TI, especially if related to
      colitis starting at the cecem, but not in subjects with typical left-sided
      colitis or granulomatous Crohn's disease. The study also provides further
      evidence suggesting the significance of food-borne antigens in the pathogenetic
      mechanism of right-sided colitis or pancolitis. The finding also indicates the
      significance of classifying colitis into gammadelta-positive and -negative
      diseases, and has implications for the treatment of these entities.

TI  - Intestinal permeation and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 385-96
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract constitutes one of the largest sites of exposure to
      the outside environment. The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring
      and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety
      of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host
      barrier; these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial
      cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system.
      Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms
      such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell
      cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier
      dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation.
      Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease
      is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the
      evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's
      disease, celiac disease, food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical
      insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.

TI  - [Anorexia nervosa and Crohn disease: diagnostic intricacies and difficulties. 3
      cases].
PG  - 312-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is readily evoked in young girls who 
      associate decreased food intake and weight loss. Among the differential diagnoses
      of anorexia, it is important to underline the preponderant place occupied by
      Crohn's disease. OBSERVATIONS: We report three cases of young 18 to 25 year-old
      girls, initially treated for anorexia nervosa in a psychiatric department.
      Diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made within 5 to 13 years. The clinical and
      biological characteristics are reported for each case. COMMENTS: In view of the
      frequency of digestive disorders concomitant to eating disorders, the distinction
      between anorexia and digestive disease is particularly delicate. It requires
      appropriate somatic and biological assessment that, when confronted with clinical
      and/or biological atypia, may query the initial diagnosis of anorexia.

TI  - Complementary practitioners' views of treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - A substantial number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease use
      complementary therapies to manage their disease, including chiropractic and
      herbal therapies. The objective of this study was to explore whether providers of
      these therapies see patients with inflammatory bowel disease and recommend
      therapies, and to determine their opinions about the treatments that they
      recommend. The study sample comprised 66 chiropractors, 19 pharmacists, 16
      herbalists and 15 health food store employees in Calgary, Alberta. A structured
      questionnaire containing two patient scenarios (a patient with active ulcerative 
      colitis and a patient with inactive Crohn's disease) was completed either by an
      in-person interview or by a mailed questionnaire. Most respondents had seen
      patients with ulcerative colitis, and at least 80% of each group except
      pharmacists (only 10%) would treat these patients or recommend treatment. Almost 
      all chiropractors used spinal manipulation, whereas herbalists and health food
      store employees suggested a wide range of different treatments. Chiropractors
      rated their treatment as moderately effective; herbalists and health food store
      employees viewed their recommendations as very effective. The results with
      respect to the second scenario were very similar. The wide range of treatment
      recommendations by practitioners, who differ greatly in terms of skills,
      knowledge and experience, has important implications for physician-patient
      communication, information provision and education regarding complementary and
      alternative therapies.

TI  - Short-term efficacy of enteral nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease: a randomized, controlled trial comparing nutrient formulas.
PG  - 98-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary fat content to induce clinical remission in
      active Crohn's disease has been the subject of controversy. We therefore
      performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the effects of
      nutrient formulas differing in the amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT).
      METHODS: Thirty-six patients with active Crohn's disease whose Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) was > or =150 were included in the study. A formula with
      3.4 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a low-fat
      content (ED group), and a formula with 55.6 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used 
      as the nutrient formula with a high amount of MCT (TL group). RESULTS: The rate
      of short-term remission induction at 6 weeks was 67% in the ED group and 72% in
      the TL group (p = NS). Therapy markedly reduced the high CDAI and van Hees
      activity index in both groups, with no significant difference in the pattern of
      the time-course changes. C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, and low serum albumin and plasma prealbumin levels normalized over the
      course of therapy, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. The
      assessment of fatty acid fractions revealed that the triene/tetraene ratio began 
      to increase at 2 weeks in the ED group. The serum levels of linoleic acid, an
      omega-6 fatty acid, almost always varied within the normal range during the
      treatment period in the TL group, but in the ED group, levels began to decrease
      significantly at 2 weeks. The levels of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid,
      decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nutrient formulas induced clinical
      remission in about two-thirds of patients. The results of the present study
      suggest that it is not necessary to restrict the amount of MCT when given in
      liquid form to patients with active Crohn's disease.

AB  - Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the
      development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute
      attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding
      (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The
      remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen
      with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less
      unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission
      phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet
      that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular
      appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or
      mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or
      supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet".
      The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.

TI  - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, 
      and specific IgE to food allergens in children with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 162-8
AB  - Differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)
      is difficult in the initial phases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD). This study was performed to determine the significance of
      anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibodies (ASCA) in IBD. ANCA were specified with regard to their antigenic
      specifity, significance to the diagnosis, and correlation of titer with the
      disease activity. The occurrence of food allergy was questioned, too. Serum
      samples from 44 children with UC (n = 23) or CD (n = 21) and from disease-control
      children (coeliac disease, n = 21) were analyzed for IgG ANCA, ANCA target
      antigens, IgA and IgG ASCA, and IgE to food allergens. Results show that ANCA
      occur more frequently in UC than in CD and disease-control (74, 24, and 10%,
      respectively). The presence of ANCA does not reflect disease activity. Antigenic 
      specificity does not differ in any group. IgA-ASCA are found more often in
      patients with CD (76% versus 17% in UC). The testing for both ANCA and ASCA
      enabled clear-cut differential diagnosis between UC and CD based on the high
      specificity (ANCA+ ASCA- 92.5% for UC, ANCA- ASCA+ 93.2% for CD). Specific IgE to
      food allergens were found in 8.7, 14.3, and 23.8% of patients with UC, CD, and
      coeliac disease, respectively. We conclude that combined testing of ANCA and ASCA
      represents a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis between UC and CD in
      pediatric patients, minimizing invasive diagnostic procedures. Monitoring of
      ANCA, its specificity, and titer determination does not bring more information.
      Testing for specific IgE to food allergens may be considered in individual
      patients.

TI  - Crohn's disease and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis: current issues.
PG  - 2103-10
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic debilitating inflammatory bowel disease of unknown
      etiology. Proposed causes include bacterial or viral infection, diet or exposure 
      to tobacco smoke, genetic abnormality, and immune dysfunction. The bacterium
      Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) has received much research
      attention as a potential cause of the disease. Map causes Johne's disease in
      ruminants. The pathology of Johne's disease superficially resembles that of
      Crohn's disease in humans. Some researchers have shown evidence of Map in
      intestinal tissues of Crohn's disease patients. Studies are in progress to
      investigate the possibility that Map exists in milk from infected cows and
      survives pasteurization. This is a controversial subject with the potential for
      media attention and public outcry. We examined the current literature and
      concluded that insufficient evidence exists at this time to implicate any one
      factor, including Map in milk, as the definitive cause of Crohn's disease. The
      high degree of uncertainty in this issue requires regulators to recognize the
      need for effective risk communication as ongoing research provides additional
      information about the disease.

TI  - The bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease: current insights in
      pathogenesis and the influence of antibiotics and probiotics.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in
      recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major
      role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have
      shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD,
      inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial
      concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of
      relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents.
      Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic
      inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct
      contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause
      a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased
      mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD.
      Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that
      recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the
      immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather
      than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in
      attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These
      include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in
      affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of
      serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of
      individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ
      hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism
      has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the
      luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of
      this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of
      Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas
      Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative
      colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The
      arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex
      intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora.
      Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal
      border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral
      nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past
      few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained
      attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, 
      research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria
      with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and
      better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.

TI  - Use of the bead beater for preparation of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis template
      DNA in milk.
PG  - 201-5
AB  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is a recognized chronic enteric pathogen that can 
      affect many different species of animals, including primates. It has been
      suggested that this organism is associated with Crohn's disease in humans, and
      that milk is a potential source of human exposure to this organism. The limit of 
      the detection of M. paratuberculosis in milk samples by direct PCR was 10(5)
      cfu/mL if the traditional boiling method was used for template DNA preparation.
      In this study, an improved method for template DNA preparation was examined. The 
      method involves the use of a bead beater, which breaks up bacterial cell wall
      mechanically by vibrating bacteria with microbeads at high speed. The
      effectiveness of this method for lysing M. paratuberculosis cells was compared to
      that of the freeze-thaw method, and use of commercial kits such as the InstaGene 
      Matrix and the QIAamp Tissue Kit. The bead beater procedure was tested in
      combination with various cell lysis and template DNA preparation procedures to
      determine which of these steps improved the limit of detection of PCR assay that 
      amplifies a 413 bp fragment of the IS900 gene. Results showed that the use of the
      bead beater, in combination with the use of lysis buffer, boiling, and
      isopropanol precipitation, decreased the limit of detection of M.
      paratuberculosis in milk by the PCR to 10(2) cfu/mL. The limit of detection was
      further decreased to 10 cfu/mL when 0.0037% bovine serum albumin was included in 
      the PCR reaction mixtures. The improved assay was 10- to 10(4)-fold more
      sensitive than the PCR assays using template DNA prepared by other lysis
      procedures including boiling alone, freeze-thaw plus boiling, or use of
      commercial kits for lysis.

TI  - Reduced plasma antioxidant concentrations and increased oxidative DNA damage in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1289-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating
      antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue
      injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic
      genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were
      determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients
      and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for
      antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was
      administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of 
      dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced
      in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to
      controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD 
      patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No
      correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid
      concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 
      0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83
      +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension.
      Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower
      than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be
      important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free
      radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant
      defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish
      whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.

TI  - Lymphonodular hyperplasia on the mucosa of the lower gastrointestinal tract in
      children: an indication of enhanced immune response?
PG  - 42-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To discover the prevalence and significance of lymphonodular
      hyperplasia (LNH) of the lower gastrointestinal tract, the authors did a
      retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of children using colonoscopy to
      evaluate persistent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The authors also sought
      to discover in more detail how often subjects with LNH of the terminal ileum (TI)
      or colon show an association with food allergy (FA). METHODS: The analysis
      included a consecutive series of 140 children evaluated at the Oulu University
      Hospital using colonoscopy, which extended to the TI in 74 of these children. A
      total of 102 patients underwent gastroduodenoscopy. The disease category was
      assessed using endoscopic, histopathologic, and clinical information. To diagnose
      FA, a masked or an open food challenge was administered to all patients who
      aroused any suspicion of food-related exacerbation of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 140
      patients, LNH of the colon was diagnosed in 46 subjects, 9 of 38 patients had
      colitis, 1 of 8 patients had Crohn disease, and 36 of the remaining 94 subjects
      did not have colitis. Twelve patients of the 22 with LNH of the colon (55%)
      showed concomitant LNH on the bulb of the duodenum. Lymphonodular hyperplasia of 
      the TI was diagnosed in 53 of the 74 subjects in whom TI could be visualized. It 
      was seen in most patients without colitis (80%), in one half the subjects with
      colitis (48%), and in one quarter of those with Crohn disease (25%). Among the
      whole study group 37 (26%) could be defined as having FA. It was more prevalent
      in patients with (52%) than in those without (13%) LNH of the colon ( P < 0.001).
      The presence of LNH in the TI also showed some association with FA ( P < 0.05),
      but less than did LNH of the colon. CONCLUSION: We consider LNH on the mucosa of 
      the colon or TI common but not an innocent bystander. Significantly related to a 
      diagnosis of gastrointestinal FA in this study, it is an expression of mucosal
      immune response. If detected on the colon, FA should be considered, whereas if
      present in TI, it may be related to FA but also to a variety of other
      immunologically active disease states.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of high versus low long chain triglyceride whole
      protein feed in active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 790-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymeric feeds have shown variable efficacy in active Crohn's
      disease (CD) with remission rates from 36% to 82%. Meta-analyses of elemental,
      peptide, and whole protein feeds have shown a strong negative correlation between
      remission rate in CD and the long chain triglyceride (LCT) content of the feed.
      We performed a randomised controlled double blind trial in patients with active
      CD comparing two single whole protein feeds with LCT supplying 5% or 30% of the
      total energy. METHODS: Fifty four patients with active CD (Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) >200, serum C reactive protein (CRP) 10 mg/l) were
      randomised to a high or low LCT feed for three weeks. The total amount of energy 
      supplied by fat was identical in the two feeds. Remission was defined as a CDAI <
      or =150 and response as a fall in CDAI of > or =70 or a CRP <10 mg/l. RESULTS:
      Overall remission rate by intention to treat was 26% for the low LCT feed and 33%
      for the high LCT feed (p=0.38). Response was achieved in 33% with the low LCT and
      in 52% with the high LCT feed (p=0.27). CRP <10 mg/l was achieved in 30% in the
      low LCT and 33% in the high LCT group (p=0.99). Thirty nine per cent (21/54) of
      patients withdrew before three weeks because of inability to tolerate the diet.
      Excluding patients unable to tolerate the diet, remission rates were 46% for low 
      LCT and 45% for high LCT (p=0.99). DISCUSSION: This trial has shown no difference
      in the effect of low and high LCT whole protein feeds in active CD. The
      previously reported correlation between LCT content of diet and response in
      active CD is unlikely to be due to LCT itself and may be due to some other
      component of high LCT feeds.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past 
      year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired
      food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better 
      understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further
      light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth
      retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided 
      further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition
      as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. 
      Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this
      modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a
      therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data
      on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention.
      Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease,
      such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or
      hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.

TI  - Enteral nutritional therapy for inducing remission of Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD000542
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the
      clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula
      design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This
      systematic review aims to provide an update on the existing efficacy data for
      both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral
      nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary
      therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of
      formula composition on efficacy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a
      computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE
      (1966-2000) and EMBASE (1984-2000), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web 
      of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of
      articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major
      gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: Gut, Gastroenterology, 
      Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral
      and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with
      leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized
      controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a
      clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating
      the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and 
      another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other
      group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted
      independently by two reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading
      and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission,
      individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with
      95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The
      results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square
      statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral
      nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of
      enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted
      on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity
      analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstracts of studies not
      yet fully published, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. 
      MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 11 trials (one abstract) comparing different
      formulations of enteral nutrition ten compared one [or more (Middleton (a)1995)] 
      elemental formulas to a non-elemental diet. The eleventh study (Akobeng 2000)
      compared two non-elemental diets differing only by glutamine enrichment in one
      group. This study was therefore not included in the primary analysis but was part
      of the subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of nine studies which included 170
      patients treated with an elemental diet and 128 patients treated with a
      non-elemental diet for active Crohn's disease demonstrated no significant
      difference among diet formulations [OR 1.15 (95% CI: 0.64, 2.08)]. Significant
      heterogeneity was not present [chi-square 9.77 (df=8)]. Subgroup and sensitivity 
      analyses had no significant effect on the results. In part B, six trials (two
      abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion
      criteria for review. Meta-analysis of four trials that included 130 patients
      treated with enteral nutrition and 123 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR 
      of 0.30 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI: 0.17, 0.52). Heterogeneity was not
      demonstrated [chi-square 0.43 (df=3)]. The risk difference calculated from this
      meta-analysis was 0.26, and the NNT (number of patients needed to treat with
      steroids rather than enteral nutrition to achieve one remission) was four. The
      same result was found in a sensitivity analysis that included abstracts. The
      inclusion of abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to
      150 in the enteral nutrition group and 142 in the steroid group but the
      meta-analysis yielded a similar result [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56)]. There were
      inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by
      age, disease duration and disease location. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS:
      Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing
      remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in past meta-analyses. There is 
      no significant difference in the efficacy of elemental and non-elemental diets
      for induction of remission of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Review article: the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-10--a therapy for
      Crohn's disease?
PG  - 1709-16
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract serves as a barrier between the host and the vast
      array of foreign antigens that are contained within its lumen. The mucosal immune
      system must balance two opposing functions: to mount an immune response to
      pathogens, whilst maintaining tolerance to antigens derived from commensal
      bacteria and food. This balance is regulated by both cellular interactions and
      the release of soluble mediators called cytokines. Diseases such as ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by alterations in the balance of
      pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Interleukin-10 is a regulatory
      cytokine which inhibits both antigen presentation and subsequent pro-inflammatory
      cytokine release. In addition, there is evidence that it promotes the formation
      of antigen-specific regulatory T-cell clones. The pivotal role played by
      interleukin-10 within the mucosal immune system is demonstrated both by the
      chronic ileocolitis that develops in gene-targeted interleukin-10 knock-out mice,
      and by its therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of colitis. However,
      trials of daily systemic interleukin-10 administration in patients with Crohn's
      disease have reported only a modest clinical response. Advances in the analysis
      of functional polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene may allow therapy to be
      targeted to patients who will respond. Finally, therapeutic strategies utilizing 
      gene therapy may enhance mucosal delivery and increase therapeutic response.

TI  - Tuberculosis associated with infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor
      alpha-neutralizing agent.
PG  - 1098-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab is a humanized antibody against tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-alpha) that is used in the treatment of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid
      arthritis. Approximately 147,000 patients throughout the world have received
      infliximab. Excess TNF-alpha in association with tuberculosis may cause weight
      loss and night sweats, yet in animal models it has a protective role in the host 
      response to tuberculosis. There is no direct evidence of a protective role of
      TNF-alpha in patients with tuberculosis. METHODS: We analyzed all reports of
      tuberculosis after infliximab therapy that had been received as of May 29, 2001, 
      through the MedWatch spontaneous reporting system of the Food and Drug
      Administration. RESULTS: There were 70 reported cases of tuberculosis after
      treatment with infliximab, for a median of 12 weeks. In 48 patients, tuberculosis
      developed after three or fewer infusions. Forty of the patients had
      extrapulmonary disease (17 had disseminated disease, 11 lymph node disease, 4
      peritoneal disease, 2 pleural disease, and 1 each meningeal, enteric,
      paravertebral, bone, genital, and bladder disease). The diagnosis was confirmed
      by a biopsy in 33 patients. Of the 70 reports, 64 were from countries with a low 
      incidence of tuberculosis. The reported frequency of tuberculosis in association 
      with infliximab therapy was much higher than the reported frequency of other
      opportunistic infections associated with this drug. In addition, the rate of
      reported cases of tuberculosis among patients treated with infliximab was higher 
      than the available background rates. CONCLUSIONS: Active tuberculosis may develop
      soon after the initiation of treatment with infliximab. Before prescribing the
      drug, physicians should screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection or
      disease.

TI  - Immune sensitization to food, yeast and bacteria in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1647-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complex food proteins and enteric flora may act as antigenic stimuli 
      in Crohn's disease. This study assessed the prevalence and magnitude of
      lymphocyte priming to these antigens in Crohn's disease. METHODS: A total of 31
      Crohn's disease patients (median age 42 years, range 25-72 years) and 22 healthy 
      controls (median 29 years, 23-43 years) were studied. Peripheral blood
      lymphocytes were collected and incubated with antigens in hanging drop culture
      for 4 days. The antigens tested were cow's milk, cereals, cabbage group, citrus
      group, peanut group, Saccharomyces (yeast), Bacteroides, E. coli and Klebsiella. 
      On the 4th day 3H-thymidine incorporation was measured after a 4-h pulse.
      Responses to antigens were considered positive if mean proliferative values were 
      above the 99% confidence interval for background proliferation. RESULTS: The mean
      background and mitogen-stimulated proliferation did not differ between patients
      and controls. The mean proliferation to antigens was not above background in
      controls, but in Crohn's patients proliferative responses to all food and
      bacterial antigens were significantly higher than background values. Twenty-three
      out of 31 Crohn's patients and five out of 22 controls (P=0.0003) responded to
      one or more antigens. Sixteen Crohn's patients and two controls responded to four
      or more antigens (P=0.001, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: The reactivity of
      peripheral lymphocytes to food, yeast and bacterial antigens, especially multiple
      antigens, is common in Crohn's disease. These sensitized lymphocytes may
      contribute to the inflammatory process.

TI  - Human colonic anti-secretory activity of the potent NK(1) antagonist, SR140333:
      assessment of potential anti-diarrhoeal activity in food allergy and inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1346-54
AB  - 1. This in vitro study was designed to determine the potential use of the NK(1)
      antagonist, SR140333 as an anti-diarrhoeal treatment for food allergy or
      inflammatory bowel disease. The effect of various immune and neuronal stimuli on 
      human colonic substance P (SP) release and the effect of SR140333 on subsequently
      stimulated mucosal ion transport was investigated. 2. Submucosal and sensory
      nerve fibre stimulation using electrical field stimulation (1 ms/7 Hz/7 V) and
      capsaicin (50 microM) respectively, mast cell activation by anti-IgE (1/250
      dilution) and granulocyte stimulation using fMLP (50 microM) each released SP and
      evoked a secretory response. 3. SP and the NK(1) selective agonist, Sar-SP (0.1 -
      1000 nM) stimulated an increase in colonic secretion which was antagonized by
      SR140333 (pD'(2)=6.7 and 7.25 versus SP and Sar-SP respectively). 4. SR140333, at
      a concentration that blocked NK(1)-mediated secretion (500 nM), also reduced the 
      secretory response to both alphaIgE and capsaicin. This suggests a
      pathophysiologic role for NK(1) receptors. 5. Capsaicin evoked SP release was
      increased in tissue taken from Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis
      patients. The response to SP was however reduced by 70 and 89% respectively. 6.
      Mast cells and sensory afferents contribute to allergic diarrhoea. Since SR140333
      reduced the secretory response to mast cell and afferent stimulation this
      compound may be particularly useful in reducing the symptoms of food allergy.

PG  - 205-9
AB  - Biological therapies are being increasingly investigated for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease. However, a great deal more study has been devoted to 
      studies of Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis,
      like Crohn's disease, represents an area of high clinical need, particularly for 
      those patients who have disease inadequately responsive to corticosteroids and
      5-aminosalicylates. The distinct anatomic distribution of inflammation in
      ulcerative colitis represents an important model for study, with the entire
      involved mucosa entirely accessible to endoscopy. In addition, there is an
      opportunity for local delivery of biologic agents in left-sided disease. Distinct
      pathogenetic factors in ulcerative colitis raise the possibility of therapies
      quite different from those used in Crohn's disease. This work describes the
      current state of knowledge regarding biological therapy in ulcerative colitis.
      The role of probiotic therapy, and studies of cytokine-directed therapies,
      therapies targeting adhesion and recruitment, and restitution and repair are
      described.

TI  - [Intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease and effects of elemental dietary
      therapy].
PG  - 636-43
AB  - Enteral intake of non-metabolic monosacharide and disaccharide, followed by
      measurement of the urinary excretion ratio of the two, is a method used to
      investigate intestinal permeability. L/R ratio (lactulose/1-rhamnose urinary
      excretion ratio) is considered an indicator of permeability of the small
      intestine. An increased L/R ratio is caused by mucosal disorders of the small
      intestine. The L/R ratio in all patients (n = 92) with Crohn's disease was 0.079 
      +/- 0.081 (mean +/- S.D.), which was significantly higher than the value in
      normal controls (0.027 +/- 0.009, n = 20, p < 0.05). In 39 patients with Crohn's 
      disease, we assessed intestinal permeability before after treatment with an
      elemental diet, and during remission. The L/R ratio was 0.120 +/- 0.092, before
      treatment and 0.065 +/- 0.097 after treatment (p < 0.05), showing increased
      intestinal permeability before elemental dietary treatment. During remission, the
      L/R ratio was 0.035 +/- 0.028; this did not differ significantly from the value
      obtained after treatment. We conclude that intestinal permeability is useful for 
      investigating disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Zinc supplementation tightens "leaky gut" in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 94-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Small intestinal permeability is often increased in patients with
      Crohn's disease and may be pathogenic for clinical relapses. No effective
      prophylactic treatment is available for these patients. The aim of this study was
      to ascertain whether zinc supplementation may improve intestinal permeability.
      METHODS: We studied 12 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease who had been in
      remission for at least 3 months and had increased intestinal permeability on two 
      separate occasions within the last 2 months. Patients received oral zinc sulfate 
      supplements (110 mg three times a day) for 8 weeks and were followed-up for 12
      months thereafter to monitor relapses. RESULTS: We found that the
      lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher before supplementation than
      after (0.041 +/- 0.003 versus 0.026 +/- 0.005). During follow-up, 10 patients had
      normal intestinal permeability and did not relapse; of the remaining two who had 
      increased intestinal permeability, one relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show
      that zinc supplementation can resolve permeability alterations in patients with
      Crohn's disease in remission. Improving intestinal barrier function may
      contribute to reduce the risk of relapse in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Adaptation of bacteria to the intestinal niche: probiotics and gut disorder.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem host to a diverse and highly
      evolved microbial community composed of hundreds of different microbial species. 
      The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the
      human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the
      incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g.,
      gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea,
      constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers).
      Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional
      microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent
      analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an
      understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal
      adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also
      elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only 
      allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional
      food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific 
      basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to 
      prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.

TI  - Etiology of Crohn's disease: the role of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by
      transmural inflammation and granuloma formation. Several theories regarding the
      etiology of Crohn's disease have been proposed, one of which is infection with
      Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), which
      causes a similar disease in animals, and is present in the human food chain.
      Considerable evidence supports the presence of M. paratuberculosis in the
      intestinal tissues of many patients with Crohn's disease including culture,
      detection of homologous mycobacterial DNA, detection of the mycobacterial
      insertion sequence IS900 by both PCR and in situ hybridization in tissues, and a 
      serologic immune response to recombinant M. paratuberculosis antigens. Despite
      this evidence, and our personal belief that M. paratuberculosis is a cause of
      Crohn's disease, widespread acceptance of this hypothesis will require evidence
      that specific anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy will cure the disease.

TI  - Does adjuvant nutritional support diminish steroid dependency in Crohn disease?
PG  - 383-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the management of
      Crohn disease, particularly during the acute phase. Nutritional supplementation
      may also prevent relapses during the quiescent phase of Crohn disease, though
      this aspect has not been widely explored. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with
      Crohn disease in remission were studied. All had steroid-dependent disease.
      Patients were randomized to receive either elemental diet (n = 19, EO28 Extra) or
      polymeric diet (Forticips, n = 14). The supplement was given orally in addition
      to normal food in an amount to provide 35%-50% of pre-trial total calorie intake.
      Prednisolone was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed up for 12 months.
      Failure was defined as increase in CDAI by 100 points from baseline to >200,
      inability to withdraw chronic steroid therapy completely, need for surgery or
      steroid therapy. RESULTS: The nutritional supplement was successful in 14 (43%)
      patients who remained in remission for 12 months with complete withdrawal of
      steroids. The response to elemental diet (42%) was similar to that of polymeric
      diet (43%). Nutrition supplement failed in 13 (39%). Six (18%) patients were
      intolerant to enteral feeding because of smell and taste problems. Per-protocol
      analysis of data indicated that the success rate of nutrition supplement in
      steroid-dependent patients was 52% (14 out of 27 patients). No disease or
      patient-related factors helped predict the response to nutrition supplement.
      CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation with either an elemental or polymeric
      diet may provide a safe and effective alternative to chronic steroid therapy in
      patients with steroid-dependent Crohn disease.

TI  - Occupational mortality from inflammatory bowel disease in the United States
      1991-1996.
PG  - 1101-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The occupational distribution of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may 
      help to shed light on its yet unknown etiology. The U.S. vital statistics offer
      the opportunity to study cause of death by occupation and industry. METHODS: The 
      numbers of deaths from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were retrieved from
      the computerized 1991-1996 data files of the National Center for Health
      Statistics. Deaths were grouped by gender, ethnicity, disease type, occupation,
      and industry. Mortality by occupation and industry were expressed as proportional
      mortality ratio (PMR), adjusted for gender and ethnicity. RESULTS: Between 1991
      and 1996, 2399 subjects died from Crohn's disease and 2419 subjects died from
      ulcerative colitis. Significant correlations were found between the PMR values of
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease regarding their distribution by
      occupation, r = 0.36 and p < 0.05, as well as by industry, r = 0.37, p < 0.01.
      IBD mortality by occupation was significantly reduced among farmers (PMR: 70, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 42-97), mining machine operators (31, 95% CI: 0-74),
      and laborers (71. 95% CI: 45-98). A nonsignificant increase was found among sales
      persons (117, 95% CI: 95-139) and secretaries (122, 95% CI: 83-161). IBD
      mortality by industry was significantly reduced in agricultural production of
      livestock (39, 95% CI: 1-78), mining (46, 95% CI: 9-83), grocery stores (55, 95% 
      CI: 17-94), and work in private households (64, 95% CI: 30-97). A nonsignificant 
      increase was found in food production (128, 95% CI: 74-182), investment and
      insurance business (137, 95% CI: 77-198), and administration (122, 95% CI:
      81-163). CONCLUSIONS: IBD mortality is low in occupations associated with manual 
      work and farming and relatively high in sedentary occupations associated with
      indoor work. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show a similar distribution.

TI  - The urban diet and Crohn's disease: is there a relationship?
PG  - 93-5
AB  - The aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) remain to be elucidated.
      In addition to genetic influences and immune mediated cytokine gene activation,
      various specific and non-specific environmental factors are considered to be
      associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The incidence of CD is higher in urban areas than in the rural,
      environment. Patients with CD have a higher dietary intake of sucrose, refined
      carbohydrates and (omega-6 fatty acids, and reduced intake of fruit and
      vegetables. Elemental and exclusion diets are known to be effective in CD.
      However, patients relapse on returning to a normal diet, which suggests that
      there is something in an ordinary diet which, on penetrating the mucosal defence 
      mechanism of the terminal ileum, generates a pathogenic immune process. It has
      been suggested that the urban diet contains large quantities of inert inorganic
      non-nutrient microparticles, such as natural contaminants (soil and dust), food
      additives and anti-caking agents which may combine with intestinal luminal
      components such as bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides, to form antigenic
      particles. When these are taken up by mucosal mononuclear cells they can mediate 
      immune reactions both locally in the mucosa and in the systemic circulation. In a
      study published in this issue of the journal, CD patients allocated to a low
      microparticle diet experienced a significant reduction in CD activity and the
      requirement for corticosteroids, when compared with the control group on a normal
      diet. The main advantage of the microparticle free diet, when compared with
      elemental and exclusion diets, is its enhanced tolerance by the patients and its 
      relatively low cost. The preliminary results may give an explanation for the
      rising incidence of the disease in urban society. The results of an on-going
      multi-centre trial by the authors are awaited with interest.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a low microparticle diet in a double blind,
      randomized, pilot study in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigen-mediated
      immune responses, and cause inflammation in susceptible individuals. Following
      recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal
      lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their
      reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a
      double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or
      ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet
      (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One
      patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive
      decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs
      control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150). In contrast, the
      control group had returned to baseline levels (302 +/- 28 on entry and 295 +/- 25
      at month 4), with none in remission. Corticosteroid intake was reduced more in
      the trial group although this did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: A low
      microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal Crohn's disease
      and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets, which similarly are low in
      microparticles.

TI  - Review article: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis as one cause of
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 337-46
AB  - A number of theories regarding the aetiology of Crohn's disease have been
      proposed. Diet, infections, other unidentified environmental factors and immune
      disregulation, all working under the influence of a genetic predisposition, have 
      been viewed with suspicion. Many now believe that Crohn's disease is a syndrome
      caused by several aetiologies. The two leading theories are the infectious and
      autoimmune theories. The leading infectious candidate is Mycobacterium avium
      subspecies paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), the causative agent
      of Johne's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease in a variety of mammals
      including cattle, sheep, deer, bison, monkeys and chimpanzees. The evidence to
      support M. paratuberculosis infection as a cause of Crohn's disease is mounting
      rapidly. Technical advances have allowed the identification and/or isolation of
      M. paratuberculosis from a significantly higher proportion of Crohn's disease
      tissues than from controls. These methodologies include: (i) improved culture
      techniques; (ii) development of M. paratuberculosis-specific polymerase chain
      reaction assays; (iii) development of a novel in situ hybridization method; (iv) 
      efficacy of macrolide and anti-mycobacterial drug therapies; and (v) discovery of
      Crohn's disease-specific seroreactivity against two specific M. paratuberculosis 
      recombinant antigens. The causal role for M. paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease 
      and correlation of infection with specific stratification(s) of the disorder need
      to be investigated. The data implicating Crohn's as an autoimmune disorder may be
      viewed in a manner that supports the mycobacterial theory. The mycobacterial
      theory and the autoimmune theory are complementary; the first deals with the
      aetiology of the disorder, the second deals with its pathogenesis. Combined
      therapies directed against a mycobacterial aetiology and inflammation may be the 
      optimal treatment of the disease.

TI  - In vitro selection criteria for probiotic bacteria of human origin: correlation
      with in vivo findings.
PG  - 386S-392S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/73.2.386s [doi]
AB  - The enteric flora comprises approximately 95% of the total number of cells in the
      human body and can elicit immune responses while protecting against microbial
      pathogens. However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract
      may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel
      disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic
      Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify
      lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile
      tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to
      host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or
      those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective
      probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically
      resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they
      may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500
      bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among
      these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was
      selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius
      strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A
      human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be 
      used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal
      tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In
      summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that 
      may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of
      gastrointestinal tract microflora.

TI  - Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of budesonide controlled ileal release
      capsules in patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - AIM: To study the influence of food on the systemic availability of budesonide in
      patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eight patients with an established
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease each received 9 mg budesonide controlled ileal
      release (CIR) capsules (Entocort capsules) orally on two separate occasions: once
      in a fasting state and once after a heavy breakfast. For reference,
      deuterium-labelled ((2)H(8)) budesonide, 0.5 mg, was given intravenously. Plasma 
      concentrations of budesonide and (2)H(8)-budesonide were determined for 12 h, and
      their pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. RESULTS: Average systemic
      availability of budesonide during fasting conditions was 10.7%, area under the
      curve was 27.5 nmol/L x h and peak plasma concentration was 4.1 nmol/L.
      Corresponding postprandial values were 13.2%, 27.0 nmol/L x h and 3. 8 nmol/L.
      Food increased the mean absorption time from 4.5 to 6.8 h (P=0.0012). Body
      clearance of budesonide was about 25% higher after eating (P=0.0015).
      CONCLUSIONS: Food had little influence on systemic availability and peak plasma
      concentrations of budesonide administered in CIR capsules. Absorption was
      retarded postprandially, likely due to delayed gastric emptying. Budesonide in
      CIR capsules can be administered at the same dose regardless of prandial status
      in patients with Crohn's disease.
