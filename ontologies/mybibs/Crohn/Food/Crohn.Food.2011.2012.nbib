TI  - Nutrition in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it useful for prevention
      and therapy?
PG  - 983-90
AB  - Countless studies aiming to discover the cause and cure of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) have been conducted over the years world-wide. Food nutrients were 
      believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction
      with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal
      microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with
      controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has
      to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication
      can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent
      long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in
      preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of
      enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease,
      according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of
      administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on
      parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.

TI  - Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

PG  - 1287-91
LID - 10.1111/imj.12015 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics in
      various areas of gastrointestinal (GI) health. Probiotics are defined as live
      microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when
      administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress 
      bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier
      function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials
      are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with
      better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon
      yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the
      current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health.

TI  - Crohn's disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli adhesion is
      enhanced by exposure to the ubiquitous dietary polysaccharide maltodextrin.
PG  - e52132
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0052132 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis evidenced by an
      altered microbiome forming thick biofilms on the epithelium. Additionally,
      adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strains are frequently isolated from ileal
      lesions of CD patients indicating a potential role for these strains in disease
      pathogenesis. The composition and characteristics of the host microbiome are
      influenced by environmental factors, particularly diet. Polysaccharides added to 
      food as emulsifiers, stabilizers or bulking agents have been linked to
      bacteria-associated intestinal disorders. The escalating consumption of
      polysaccharides in Western diets parallels an increased incidence of CD during
      the latter 20(th) century. In this study, the effect of a polysaccharide panel on
      adhesiveness of the CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 was analyzed to determine if
      these food additives promote disease-associated bacterial phenotypes.
      Maltodextrin (MDX), a polysaccharide derived from starch hydrolysis, markedly
      enhanced LF82 specific biofilm formation. Biofilm formation of multiple other E. 
      coli strains was also promoted by MDX. MDX-induced E. coli biofilm formation was 
      independent of polysaccharide chain length indicating a requirement for MDX
      metabolism. MDX exposure induced type I pili expression, which was required for
      MDX-enhanced biofilm formation. MDX also increased bacterial adhesion to human
      intestinal epithelial cell monolayers in a mechanism dependent on type 1 pili and
      independent of the cellular receptor CEACAM6, suggesting a novel mechanism of
      epithelial cell adhesion. Analysis of mucosa-associated bacteria from individuals
      with and without CD showed increased prevalence of malX, a gene essential for MDX
      metabolism, uniquely in the ileum of CD patients. These findings demonstrate that
      the ubiquitous dietary component MDX enhances E. coli adhesion and suggests a
      mechanism by which Western diets rich in specific polysaccharides may promote
      dysbiosis of gut microbes and contribute to disease susceptibility.

TI  - The influence of deficiencies of essential trace elements and vitamins on the
      course of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - In patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is
      an important complication, frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies,
      especially vitamins (both water- and fat-soluble) and essential trace elements.
      It is often a result of the disease activity, poor oral intake and/or restrictive
      diets. Nutrition plays an important role in disease management and helps to
      maintain remission in CD patients. Deficiencies occur in patients with active
      Crohn's disease, and also in those in remission. Specific supplementation of
      vitamins and micro- and macronutrients might be helpful or even necessary in this
      group of patients. This review outlines the most frequent nutritional
      deficiencies and their complications in relation to the Crohn's Disease Activity 
      Index, and provides an overview of therapeutic perspectives for CD patients in
      adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biological therapy, which
      is being used with increasing frequency, seems not only to mitigate the
      inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract, but also has significant
      impact on the nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic profiles for oral and subcutaneous methotrexate in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 340-5
LID - 10.1111/apt.12161 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is administered subcutaneously to Crohn's Disease 
      (CD) patients. There are very few studies evaluating the use of oral (PO) MTX in 
      CD. A drug and its pharmaceutical alternative are equivalent (bioequivalence)
      when the bioavailability of the alternative falls within 80-125% of the
      bioavailability of the standard (US Food and Drug Administration - FDA). AIM: To 
      compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of PO and subcutaneous (SC) MTX in CD
      patients to determine the bioequivalence of these two routes. METHODS: Eleven
      patients received a PO and an SC MTX dose (25 mg) separated by one week over a
      two-week interval. Blood samples were collected at specified times over a 24-h
      period for each patient on two separate days. MTX plasma levels were obtained
      using sensitive mass spectrometry. Areas under the curve (AUC) were compared
      between the two routes. RESULTS: The mean AUC values were 3375 ng/mL x h (PO MTX)
      and 3985 ng/mL x h (SC MTX). The mean AUC ratio (PO/SC) was 0.86 (0.62-1.08).
      This correlates with a relative PO bioavailability of 86% in comparison to SC.
      The 90% confidence interval for the mean AUC (PO/SC) ratio is (0.785, 0.929).
      There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The mean MTX AUC (PO/SC) in these
      patients falls outside the 90% confidence interval for the bioequivalence limit. 
      SC MTX is more bioavailable than PO MTX; however, the mean relative MTX
      bioavailability (PO/SC) nearly met the FDA bioequivalence standard and PO MTX
      could be proposed in responders who would prefer this route.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that
      primarily affects the intestines, resulting in breakage of the intestinal
      barrier, pathological inflammation and nutritional disorders that encompass from 
      trace elements deficiency to severe malnutrition. Nutritional interventions
      either alone or associated to drug therapy may be effective to achieve and
      maintain inflammation remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual food intake as
      quantitative and qualitatively, in CD patients; and describe the effect of a
      supplement containing whey proteins and TGF- on their body composition. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed considering 42 consecutive patients,
      followed in a tertiary center, and by using the 3-day food recall and food intake
      frequency questionnaire. Body composition was assessed previously and 8 weeks
      after supplementation with a diet containing whey proteins and TGF-beta (N = 22).
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Considering carbohydrates and lipids, most patients had
      adequate dietary intake according recommendations. Protein, saturated fat, B12
      vitamin and zinc intakes were higher than the recommended values. The dietary
      fiber, A, D, C and E vitamins, calcium, iron, folate, potassium and sodium
      intakes did not reach the recommended requirements in most patients. Patients
      supplemented with the whey protein and TGF-beta dietary presented a positive
      increment in their lean body mass, when compared to non-supplemented group.
      CONCLUSION: CD patients require nutritional orientation. Whey protein intake
      resulted in significant differences, such as improvement in Lean Body Mass and
      reduction in Fat percentage.

AB  - Definitive curative strategies for inflammatory bowel disease remain challenging 
      for physicians and patients. For decades, probiotic organisms have been used in
      various gastrointestinal diseases. Only recently has comprehension of the
      pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease developed to the point where the
      significance of the host gastrointestinal microbial population is seen to have
      marked influence on the initiation and ongoing inflammatory processes of Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Well-designed, large randomized controlled trials
      using probiotics in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are required for
      probiotics to become mainstream therapy.

TI  - A prospective study of pre-illness diet in newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 40-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors, including diet, seem to participate in the
      etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. The kind of dietetic habits before the
      appearance of the illness in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) has not been
      studied extensively. AIM: To prospectively assess the kind of food consumption in
      patients with CD exactly at the time of diagnosis and to identify dietary
      constituents as risk factors for development of CD. PATIENTS - METHODS: Twenty
      eight patients with a newly established diagnosis of CD (2-4 weeks), (12 men and 
      16 women), 30 patients with previously (between 2 - 11 years) established
      diagnosis of CD (14 men and 16 women) and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy
      controls (16 men and 22 women) were included in the study. Dietary intake was
      assessed by means of special questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparisons between controls
      and newly diagnosed patients showed that increased consumption of milk and yogurt
      (P = 0.042), fruits (P = 0.0001), citrus (P = 0.0001), vegetables (P = 0.0001),
      carrots (P = 0.0001), legumes (P = 0.036), fish and selfish (P = 0.001), honey (P
      = 0.003), and nuts (P = 0.038), was associated with decreased risk for CD. On the
      other hand, significantly increased intake of fat (P = 0.041), olive oil (P =
      0.038), margarine (P = 0.038), sugar (P = 0.02), alcohol drinks (P = 0.009),
      fried food (P = 0.0001), and pasta (P = 0.0001), was noticed on recently
      diagnosed patients in comparison with the healthy control group. On logistic
      regression analysis foods remaining statistically significant were: margarine,
      pasta, fried foods, fat, olives, sugar (increased risk), and yogurt, honey,
      fruits, nuts, fish, and citrus fruits (decreased risk). Newly diagnosed patients 
      were significantly overweighed (64%) compared to healthy people (26%) and old
      patients (7%). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in many kinds of food between 
      newly diagnosed patients with CD, patients with established CD and normal people 
      certainly exist. Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be
      associated with higher or lower risks for CD in adults. However, whether these
      dietary factors are important for the development of CD or modulate the effect of
      other environmental factors is unknown.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutrition on gut microflora function in children with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1454-9
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.703234 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment in
      children with active Crohn's disease (CD) but is seldom used in adults with
      active disease. The mode of action of EEN in suppressing mucosal inflammation is 
      not fully understood, but modulation of intestinal microflora activity is one
      possible explanation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      6-week EEN in children with active CD, with special reference to intestinal
      microflora function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 18 children (11
      boys, 7 girls; median age 13.5 years) with active CD (13 children with small
      bowel/colonic and 5 with perianal disease) were analyzed for short chain fatty
      acid (SCFA) pattern as marker of gut microflora function. The children were
      studied before and after EEN treatment. Results from 12 healthy teenagers were
      used for comparison. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) of the children with small
      bowel/colonic CD responded clinically positively to EEN treatment showing
      decreased levels of pro-inflammatory acetic acid as well as increased
      concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyric acids and also of valeric acids,
      similar to the levels in healthy age-matched children. In children with active
      perianal CD, however, EEN had no positive effect on clinical status or
      inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present new data supporting the
      hypothesis that the well-documented anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children
      with active small bowel/colonic CD is brought about by modulation of gut
      microflora activity, resulting in an anti-inflammatory SCFA pattern. By contrast,
      none of the children with perianal disease showed clinical or biochemical
      improvement after EEN treatment.

TI  - Enteral nutrition to suppress postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence: a
      five-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1587-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral
      nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients
      following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to 
      prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty
      consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were
      included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet
      infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). 
      Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction
      (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No
      patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except
      patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence
      requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not
      continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN
      group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence
      requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate
      requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group
      (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the
      control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative
      incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the
      difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this
      study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD
      recurrence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-tumor
      necrosis factor drugs (anti-TNFs) for Crohn's disease (CD) have not been directly
      compared. AIM: To compare the efficacy of the three anti-TNFs for CD in clinical 
      practice. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients initiated on anti-TNF between
      2004 and 2008. Disease activity, quality of life, and remission rates were
      compared between groups over 1 year. RESULTS: Sixty patients with CD were
      initiated on anti-TNF from 2004 to 2008: 31 on infliximab (IFX) and 29 on
      adalimumab (ADA) or certolizumab pegol (CTZ). More patients in the ADA/CTZ scores
      group had prior exposure to anti-TNF (76 versus 10%, p < 0.01). Mean
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) scores in the IFX group were lower than in the
      ADA/CTZ group at 12 months (2.72 +/- 3.34 versus 5.63 +/- 5.33, p = 0.03). At 12 
      months, more IFX patients were in remission compared with those on ADA/CTZ (88
      versus 53%, p </= 0.01). Mean short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire
      (SIBDQ) scores were not different between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at 12
      months. Stratified analyses and logistic regression based on prior anti-TNF use
      did not show differences in remission rates at any time point post-baseline
      between groups. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for prior anti-TNF there was no
      difference in remission rates between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at any time
      point post-baseline. This suggests that differences between groups were accounted
      for by a higher rate of prior anti-TNF in the ADA/CTZ group. Our results should
      be reviewed with caution given the small sample size.

TI  - Use of complementary and alternative medicine in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease: results of a cross-sectional study in Norway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of complementary and alternative medicine 
      (CAM) use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify
      demographic and clinical factors that are associated with CAM use. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study design, patients with confirmed diagnosis 
      of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), and >/=18 years old,
      attending outpatient clinics at 14 hospitals in Norway were eligible to complete 
      questionnaires including demographics, clinical variables, and the International 
      CAM Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). RESULTS: Of 460 patients included in the study, 430 
      had evaluable questionnaires (response rate 93%). Forty-nine percent (95% CI:
      44-54) had used some type of CAM within the past 12 months. CAM services were
      utilized by 27% (95% CI: 23-31) of the patients, 21% (95% CI: 16-23) reported use
      of CAM products, and 28% (95% CI: 23-31) used CAM self-help practices. The most
      common pattern of CAM use was to combine CAM services and CAM products.
      Significantly, more UC patients (56%) than CD patients (44%) reported CAM use, p 
      = 0.03. In UC, only the presence of at least one comorbid condition was directly 
      related to CAM use. In CD, being a woman, being aged 31-50 years, having a higher
      education level, and experiencing adverse drug reactions from IBD medication were
      factors independently associated with the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM was 
      common among IBD patients attending outpatient clinics. Both demographic and
      clinical factors were associated to CAM use, but the factors differed in their
      significance for UC and CD.

TI  - Angioedema associated with Crohn's disease: response to biologics.
PG  - 4787-90
AB  - A 46-year-old female patient with terminal ileum Crohn's disease and ankylosing
      spondylitis presented with recurrent angioedema and urticaria. Investigations
      ruled out hereditary angioedema, and environmental or food allergen triggers. She
      was diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria with angioedema, and was treated 
      with a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin immunotherapy, danazol, prednisone and
      hydroxyzine. Due to ongoing bowel and arthritic complaints, she was started on
      infliximab infusions and within 2 treatments, she had complete resolution of the 
      angioedema and urticaria, as well as of the bowel and arthritic symptoms.
      Unfortunately she developed allergic reactions to the infliximab and was switched
      to another anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agent, adalimumab. Since then, 
      she has had no further angioedema or urticaria, and her Crohn's disease has been 
      quiescent. This is the first known case report of chronic idiopathic urticaria
      with angioedema coexistent with Crohn's disease that was successfully treated
      with anti-TNF-alpha agents.

TI  - Impact of environmental and dietary factors on the course of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 3814-22
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i29.3814 [doi]
AB  - Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted
      to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the
      outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of
      smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its
      influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD,
      active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this
      clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients
      who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit
      in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of
      IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very
      frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general
      dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients
      should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role 
      of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation
      of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem 
      to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil,
      medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a
      therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in
      inactive UC.

TI  - Cost per responder associated with biologic therapies for Crohn's disease,
      psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 620-34
LID - 10.1007/s12325-012-0035-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy and safety in several
      chronic systemic disorders. The authors indirectly compared response rates and
      costs per responder associated with biologic treatments for moderate-to-severe
      Crohn's disease (CD), psoriasis (Ps), and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: 
      A systematic literature search was performed to identify phase 3 randomized
      controlled trials of biologics for CD (adalimumab, infliximab), Ps (adalimumab,
      etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg), or
      methotrexate-refractory RA (abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept,
      golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab). Food and Drug
      Administration-approved dosing schedules were evaluated. Published response rates
      were extracted, with response defined in CD, Ps, and RA as: >/=70-point reduction
      in CD Activity Index at 12 months; >/=75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and
      Severity Index at 3 months; and >/=50% improvement in American College of
      Rheumatology component scores at 6 months. Within each indication,
      mixed-treatment comparison meta-analyses were conducted to derive pooled
      estimates and 95% CIs of response rate difference versus placebo for each
      biologic, adjusting for cross-trial variation in control-arm response rates. Cost
      per responder was estimated for each biologic as projected per patient drug costs
      (2011 US$) divided by response rate difference. RESULTS: Altogether, 23
      publications were selected. In CD, 12-month cost per responder was estimated at
      $116,291 (95% CI $71,637-208,348) for adalimumab and $125,169 (95% CI
      $60,532-267,101) for infliximab. Among biologics approved in Ps, 3-month cost per
      responder was lowest for adalimumab ($9,756; 95% CI $8,668-11,131), infliximab
      ($12,828; 95% CI $11,772-13,922), and ustekinumab 45 mg ($13,821; 95% CI
      $12,599-15,167). In RA, biologics with the lowest 6-month cost per responder were
      adalimumab ($27,853; 95% CI $19,284-40,270), etanercept ($29,140; 95% CI
      $14,170-61,030), and tocilizumab ($31,363; 95% CI $14,713-64,232). CONCLUSION:
      Meta-analyses of clinical trials found considerable variation in
      cost-effectiveness of biologic therapies for CD, Ps, and RA. These results may
      help determine biologic utilization in these chronic diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands
      long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of
      remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients 
      with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. 
      The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. 
      However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has
      prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds.
      Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral
      budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium.
      At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in
      microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral
      beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided
      or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these
      compounds in IBD clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn's
      disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a
      referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in
      relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of
      a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when
      measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up
      DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn
      indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol
      which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic
      patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were
      prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar 
      spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and 
      low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four
      patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4
      years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in
      lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD
      were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a
      contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD
      patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment
      of CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and 
      nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the
      proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions
      occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is
      important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this
      intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised
      with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial
      colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome,
      histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses
      were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the
      colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day 
      after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the
      basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during
      conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an
      oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue
      transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified 
      tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic
      reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response
      signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin
      sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the
      dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the 
      jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The
      molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the
      declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for
      instance.

TI  - Downregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in normal colonic macrophages
      and reinduction in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 34-47
LID - 10.1159/000336353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In normal mucosa, intestinal lamina propria macrophages (IMACs)
      maintain tolerance against food antigens and the commensal bacterial flora.
      Several mechanisms have been identified that mediate tolerance. The
      ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a large multiprotein complex that degrades
      cellular proteins. As the UPS may modulate immune functions of IMACs, we
      performed a detailed investigation of UPS expression and function under normal
      conditions and in cells derived from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). METHODS: IMACs were isolated from intestinal mucosa. mRNA
      expression of macrophages differentiated in vitro (i.v. MACs) and IMACs was
      compared by Affymetrix(R) oligonucleotide arrays. Quantitative Taqman-PCR was
      performed on five exemplary proteasomal and five ubiquitinylation genes each.
      Proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Proteasome
      function was assessed by a fluorimetric test. RESULTS: Affymetrix analysis showed
      downregulation of mRNA expression of almost all represented proteasomal and of 22
      ubiquitination-associated genes in IMACs as compared to i.v. MACs and monocytes. 
      By quantitative PCR, up to tenfold higher mRNA expression of 10 exemplary genes
      of the UPS (UBE2A, UBE2D2, UBE2L6, USP14, UBB and ATPase2, beta2, beta5,
      beta2i/MECL-1, beta5i/LMP7) was demonstrated in i.v. MACs as compared to IMACs.
      Immunohistochemistry and Western blots confirmed these findings in intestinal
      mucosa of controls and patients suffering from diverticulitis. In contrast, a
      significant increase in protein amounts was found in mucosa of patients with IBD.
      CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of subunits of the UPS in IMACs of normal mucosa
      supports the concept of the presence of a nonreactive, anergic macrophage
      phenotype in the gut under normal conditions. Reinduction in IMACs of IBD mucosa 
      reflects activated IMACs which can present antigenic peptides and thus support
      inflammation.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the
      intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that
      provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous
      studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be
      distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and
      faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC
      patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into
      two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and
      histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling
      techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be
      differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included
      TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison 
      of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the
      surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from
      UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to
      distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must 
      be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of
      confounding factors.

LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2012.04.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease. Elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition are effective therapies
      for Crohn's disease; however, changes of microbiota as a result of both
      treatments have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To elucidate changes of faecal
      microbiota in Crohn's disease patients treated with elemental diet and total
      parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 33 active
      Crohn's disease patients and 17 healthy subjects, and recollected after elemental
      diet (8 patients) and total parenteral nutrition (9 patients). Terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16srDNA was
      performed to evaluate the whole microbiota. Specific quantitative PCR was then
      used to determine populations of predominant bacterial groups. RESULTS: In
      Crohn's disease patients, the number of terminal restriction fragments, which
      reflects bacterial species, was significantly lower. Populations of total
      bacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly lower and the ratio of
      Enterococcus was higher. The number of terminal restriction fragments was
      significantly decreased after total parenteral nutrition, but not after elemental
      diet. Population of Bacteroides fragilis significantly decreased after elemental 
      diet, while population of Enterococcus significantly increased after total
      parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients
      was markedly different from healthy subjects. Species diversity was reduced by
      total parenteral nutrition, but not by elemental diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the
      clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is
      controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the
      performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS:
      Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 
      PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease,
      without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given,
      including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles
      were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the
      randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and
      outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford
      quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected
      for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of
      omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive
      inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials
      assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly
      ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use
      in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the
      heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's
      disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is
      questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make
      firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

AB  - Probiotics are organisms which provide a desired and beneficial effect on human
      health. With recent evidence implicating a disruption in the balance of the
      gastrointestinal microbiome and intestinal immunity as a potential trigger for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there has been growing interest in using
      probiotics as an adjunct to standard anti-inflammatory and immune suppressing
      therapy. Animal models describe potential and plausible mechanisms of action for 
      probiotics to counter inflammation of colonic mucosa. Although there are
      insufficient data to recommend probiotics in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease, good evidence supports the use of specific probiotics for maintenance of
      remission in pouchitis. Although there are limited regulatory standards for the
      agents, probiotics are relatively safe with minimal reported side effects or
      contraindications. More rigorous studies need to be published supporting efficacy
      and safety of these agents before they become a mainstay of IBD medical
      treatment.

AB  - Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis) are among the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. This group includes
      approximately 80 disorders, some of which can at times be associated in a single 
      patient. In psoriasis, Crohn's disease may be observed slightly more frequently, 
      but ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are also an issue. The underlying
      relations between these disorders comprise: i) genetic data obtained by
      genome-wide association studies that show the involvement of shared predisposing 
      loci and/or genes, for example, in innate immunity; ii) immunological data: these
      disorders share inflammation effector mechanisms, particularly the activation
      pathway of Th17 lymphocytes, which explains the efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies
      and anti-IL-12/23; and iii) environmental co-factors such as smoking, possibly
      certain food proteins (gliadin, etc.), and bacterial infections that are probably
      decisive elements in the genesis of these diseases.

TI  - Advances in inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 257-70
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition that
      burdens the lives of many children around the world. It is characterized by
      chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis
      and IBD-unknown are the three types of this disease. The management of children
      with inflammatory bowel disease is complex and requires skill, knowledge and
      experience with current advances in the field. Over the past several years, there
      have been a number of achievements and progress made in the care and management
      of this disorder. The diagnostic tools have greatly improved. The therapeutic
      armamentarium has expanded. The genetics of IBD has become more detailed and the 
      role of the gut microbiome has been better defined. The evolution of biological
      agents has revolutionized the way we approach this disease. This review
      highlights the recent advances in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and
      provides an overview for clinicians caring for children with this disorder.

      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 649-54
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2012.03.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine is often used as maintenance therapy in patients
      with Crohn's disease. However, toxicities like myelosuppression limit its
      clinical benefit. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of elemental diet versus
      6-mercaptopurine as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. METHODS: Ninety-five 
      eligible patients with Crohn's disease activity index </=150 were randomly
      assigned to: 6-mercaptopurine (0.5-1.5mg/kg/day, n=30); Elental as an elemental
      diet (>/=900 kcal/day, n=32); none (control, n=33). In the three groups, patients
      were and remained on 5-aminosalicylic acid (2250-3000 mg/day). Patients were
      observed for 2 years and the rate of relapse (Crohn's disease activity index
      >/=200) was monitored. RESULTS: At 24 months, the fractions of patients who had
      maintained remission were 60%, 46.9% and 27.2% for 6-mercaptopurine, Elental and 
      the control groups, respectively. Log-rank test showed better efficacy for
      6-mercaptopurine (P=0.0041) and Elental (P=0.0348) versus control. No significant
      difference was found between 6-mercaptopurine and Elental. Further, in the
      6-mercaptopurine group, 2 patients experienced liver injury and one developed
      alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: This 24 months comparison study showed that Elental as
      maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease patients was as effective as
      6-mercaptopurine. Elental should be useful for long-term maintenance therapy in
      Crohn's disease. This is the first comparison study evaluating nutritional
      therapy versus 6-mercaptopurine.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can
      affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune
      processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves
      some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children,
      in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with
      similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody
      stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed 
      during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in
      these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be
      especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As
      such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating
      patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a 
      variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved
      endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis 
      and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of
      complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for
      practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks
      and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and
      especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not
      geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the
      management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to
      educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for
      children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans
      between primary care and subspecialty providers.

TI  - The effects of provocation by foods with raised IgG antibodies and additives on
      the course of Crohn's disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 19-27
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study was designed to assess the role of foods with raised 
      IgG antibodies and additives on the symptoms and inflammation of Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: Eight patients with Crohn's disease in remission were studied. They
      followed a strict diet during phase I. Then, provocations with two, three-day
      periods (phases II and III) followed: in phase II, pure forms of foods with high 
      IgG antibodies and in phase III, off-the-shelf forms of those foods were added.
      Stool samples were collected for fecal calprotectin assay. Blood samples were
      taken on the 11th and 17th days for highly sensitive C-reactive protein,
      ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, and platelets.
      Patients kept a diet-symptom diary. RESULTS: Increased Crohn's disease activity
      index scores were found statistically significant (p=0.012) between pre- and
      during the provocation weeks. There were significant increases according to
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index when the highest values during the phases I, II (p=0.027)
      and I, III (p=0.027) were compared. The increases in highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein (p=0.025) and white blood cells (p= 0.036) were found statistically
      significant. Fecal calprotectin levels showed day-to-day variability. When
      compared, the levels of fecal calprotectin increased in all patients on the last 
      day of the restriction (10th day) and the first day of the provocation (11th day)
      with the exception of one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Foods with raised IgG antibody
      levels and food additives can provoke the symptoms and may stimulate the
      inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease. Addition of a proper diet with
      restriction of those foods may be beneficial in the medical treatment.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

TI  - Extracorporeal photopheresis: clinical use so far.
PG  - 126-31
LID - 10.1002/jca.21217 [doi]
AB  - Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP or photopheresis) is an advanced therapeutic
      apheresis procedure in which blood is separated into its various components and
      the isolated buffy coat is treated with 8-methoxypsoralen (a photoactivating
      drug), exposed to ultraviolet light and returned to the patient. All other
      remaining blood components are also returned to the patient. The purpose of this 
      procedure is immunomodulation. The treated leukocytes, specifically T-cells, are 
      returned to the patient's circulation and will induce cytotoxicity and reduce
      proliferation of new T-cells. In the United States, ECP was initially approved
      for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma by the US Food and Drug
      Administration in the late 1980s. Since that time, it has been used as an
      "off-label" therapy to treat several other autoimmune diseases in the United
      States and even more extensively in Europe and Asia. The following review is
      limited to the current clinical use of ECP in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Crohn's 
      disease, systemic sclerosis, graft versus host disease, and emerging data on
      nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

PG  - 260-70
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2012.41 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both
      genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of
      involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the
      probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various 
      environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut
      microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission,
      reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease
      is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback
      provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput
      genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are
      modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is 
      transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of
      thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers
      generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure
      the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods
      have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time 
      is right to move them to human studies.

AB  - The second scientific workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization
      (ECCO) focused on the relevance of intestinal healing for the disease course of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective was to better understand basic
      mechanisms, markers for disease prediction, detection and monitoring of
      intestinal healing, impact of intestinal healing on the disease course of IBD as 
      well as therapeutic strategies. The results of this workshop are presented in
      four separate manuscripts. This section describes basic mechanisms of intestinal 
      healing, identifies open questions in the field and provides a framework for
      future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physical activity is important for muscle and bone strength 
      in the growing child and may be impaired in paediatric patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) even during quiescent disease. The SenseWearPro(2) armband
      allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS:
      Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in 
      remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39
      healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI),
      lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related
      Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to
      record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality 
      of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy 
      intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and
      pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed
      lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34])
      and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards
      lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of
      physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients
      with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between
      patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass
      and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity 
      may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) will have intestinal 
      resection during their life. Most patients will, however, develop postoperative
      recurrence (endoscopic, clinical or surgical). Several medical and surgical
      strategies have been attempted to prevent postoperative recurrence. This review
      evaluates the efficacy of different drug regimens and surgical techniques in the 
      prevention of clinical, endoscopic and surgical postoperative recurrence of CD.
      METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials on medical or
      surgical interventions was performed. The endpoints for efficacy were clinical,
      endoscopic and surgical recurrence. Meta-analyses were performed in case two or
      more RCTs evaluated the same drug or surgical technique. RESULTS: Mesalamine is
      more effective in preventing clinical recurrence than placebo (P=0,012), as well 
      as nitroimidazolic antibiotics at one year follow-up (P<0.001) and thiopurines
      (P=0.018). Nitroimidazolic antibiotics are also more effective than placebo in
      preventing endoscopic recurrence (P=0.037), as well as thiopurines (P=0.015) and 
      infliximab (P=0.006). Budenoside, probiotics, Interleukin-10 nor any of the
      different surgical procedures showed any significant difference compared to
      placebo in postoperative recurrence rates of CD. CONCLUSION: Among the different 
      drug regimens and surgical techniques, only thiopurines and nitroimidazolic
      antibiotics are able to reduce postoperative clinical as well as endoscopic
      recurrence of CD. Mesalamine and infliximab also seem to be superior to placebo
      in preventing clinical recurrence and endoscopic recurrence, respectively. There 
      is a paucity of trials evaluating long-term follow-up and prevention of surgical 
      recurrence of CD.

TI  - Risedronate improves bone mineral density in Crohn's disease: a two year
      randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 777-86
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.01.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have an increased frequency of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis. This randomized, controlled, double-blind study
      assessed the efficacy of risedronate versus placebo in treating low bone mineral 
      density (BMD) in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: 88 Crohn's disease
      outpatients with BMD T-score<-1.0 by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for the two year study duration:
      one group received risedronate 35 mg weekly while another received placebo. Both 
      groups received daily calcium (Ca; 500 mg) and vitamin D (D; 400 IU)
      supplementation. Percent change in BMD relative to baseline was compared between 
      the two therapies at 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Using intent-to-treat analysis,
      at 12 months, risedronate+Ca+D increased BMD, relative to baseline, more than
      placebo+Ca+D in the femoral trochanter (1.4+/-3.4% vs -0.1+/-3.1%; p=0.03) and
      total hip (1.1+/-2.7% vs -0.1+/-2.5%;p=0.04). This trend in greater BMD continued
      for the 24 month duration of the study. There was no difference between the two
      treatment groups for changes in spine BMD. Subgroup analysis revealed that
      risedronate+Ca+D resulted in significantly better improvement in femoral
      trochanter BMD in non-smokers (p=0.01), males (p=0.01), those with a history of
      corticosteroid use in the preceding year (p=0.01), and current users of
      immunosuppressants (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate, in addition to daily
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation, is superior to calcium and vitamin D alone
      in improving femoral trochanter and total hip BMD in patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease: prevalence, risk factors and supplement 
      use in an outpatient setting.
PG  - 182-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.08.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency impacts on bone health and has
      potential new roles in inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and 
      risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and to explore vitamin D supplement usage
      in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in an outpatient setting, compared with
      controls. METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were
      measured by radioimmunoassay in 151 participants, comprising 81 CD patients and
      70 age-, sex- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls. Levels of
      25(OH)D <50 nmol/L were classed as deficient. Data on vitamin supplement usage
      were recorded for all participants at interview. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency
      was common in patients with CD (63%) and significantly higher in winter than
      summer (68% v 50%; p<0.001, chi(2)). Notably, the deficiency rate remained high
      even in summer (50%). On regression analysis, 25(OH)D levels were inversely
      associated with winter season. Disease-specific factors for lower serum 25(OH)D
      levels were longer disease duration and smoking. Overall, 43% of patients
      reported using a vitamin D-containing supplement, primarily at low dosages
      (200-400 IU/d); however, this level of supplement did not prevent deficiency. For
      the majority of CD patients, 25(OH)D remained below optimal levels proposed to
      confer bone and immune health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was
      common in patients with CD and associated with longstanding disease, smoking and 
      winter. While over 40% of patients used a vitamin D-containing supplement, the
      dosages were inadequate to prevent deficiency. Appropriate vitamin D screening
      and supplementation should be considered in the context of health promotion of
      outpatients with CD.

AB  - Although the use of CAM in pediatric CD is common, quality evidence-based
      research is limited. There is clearly a need for further randomized controlled
      trials. The role of psychosocial distress in children with CD should not be
      overlooked and thus biobehavioral techniques should be considered and
      incorporated when possible. Considering the potential for growth failure and need
      for surgical intervention in CD, any CAM therapies that are not harmful should be
      used only in combination with conventional medical treatment. The importance of
      all health care providers partnering with their patients and asking about CAM
      use, as well as maintaining an awareness of efficacy, safety, harm,
      drug-supplement interactions, and appropriate referral sources, should be kept in
      mind when caring for those afflicted with this chronic disease.

AB  - Five cases of intestinal toxemia botulism in adults were identified within an
      18-month period in or near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We describe findings for 3
      of the 5 case-patients. Clinical samples contained Clostridium botulinum spores
      and botulinum neurotoxins (types A and B) for extended periods (range 41-61
      days), indicative of intestinal toxemia botulism. Patients' clinical signs
      improved with supportive care and administration of botulinum antitoxin. Peanut
      butter from the residence of 1 case-patient yielded C. botulinum type A, which
      corresponded with type A spores found in the patient's feces. The food and
      clinical isolates from this case-patient could not be distinguished by
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Two of the case-patients had Crohn disease and 
      had undergone previous bowel surgery, which may have contributed to infection
      with C. botulinum. These cases reinforce the view that an underlying
      gastrointestinal condition is a risk factor for adult intestinal toxemia
      botulism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Differing protocols have been utilized in published studies evaluating
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in the management of active pediatric Crohn's
      disease. This study aimed to ascertain the protocols currently utilized in
      different pediatric centers around the world and to highlight their similarities 
      and differences. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated to individuals at
      pediatric centers in countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.
      Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at
      their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used
      for administering EEN to these children. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35
      separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks
      to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas 
      were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings
      were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with 
      the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The
      reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common
      recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual
      introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%). CONCLUSIONS:
      This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols
      used in different areas of the world. The development of consistent protocols may
      enhance the acceptance, efficacy and wider utilization of this therapy.

      its microbiota is currently considered key to the pathogenesis of the chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Probiotics offer a method to potentially alter
      the intestinal microbiome exogenously or may provide an option to deliver
      microbial metabolic products to alter the chronicity of intestinal mucosal
      inflammation characterizing IBD. At present, there is little evidence for the
      benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated
      conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice
      guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing
      antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative
      colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but 
      concerns remain about proof from trials.

TI  - Vitamin D status and cytokine levels in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 205-10
LID - 10.1024/0300-9831/a000066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is growing evidence that vitamin D may have immunomodulatory
      properties in Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to determine if
      serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] was associated with inflammatory cytokines, 
      IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels in patients with inactive CD. METHODS: This was a
      prospective study of 75 adults with quiescent CD. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by
      radioimmunoassay and serum IL-10 and TNF-alpha by ELISA. Disease activity was
      assessed by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein
      (CRP). RESULTS: IL-10 levels were significantly lower in patients with vitamin D 
      insufficiency compared with the vitamin D replete group (mean and SE 2.48 +/-
      0.51 v 6.77 +/- 2.49 pg/mL, p < 0.001). There were, however, no differences in
      serum TNF-alpha or CRP levels based on vitamin D status. The use of a vitamin D
      supplement at a low dose (200 IU) did not significantly influence IL-10 levels.
      CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of IL-10, but not TNF-alpha, were significantly
      lower in CD patients with inadequate serum 25(OH)D. This suggests that poor
      vitamin D status may be linked to reduced anti-inflammatory capacity in this
      group.

TI  - Aluminum as an adjuvant in Crohn's disease induction.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1177/0961203311430090 [doi]
AB  - Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a
      ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water,
      waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of
      aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal
      inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet
      unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of
      inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the
      immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be
      adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared
      cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and
      stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota,
      trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The
      inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology.
      It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of
      innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted
      with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound
      surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic
      criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by
      adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the
      consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.

TI  - Circulating epithelial cells in patients with benign colon diseases.
PG  - 936-40
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2011.175570 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood
      is a rapidly developing research field with clear clinical implications for the
      staging and monitoring of cancer patients. Current CTC assays, including the US
      Food and Drug Administration-cleared CellSearch(R) system, typically use markers 
      [e.g., cytokeratins (CKs), the transmembrane protein EpCAM (epithelial cell
      adhesion molecule)] that are expressed on normal and malignant epithelial cells
      but not on the surrounding normal leukocytes. METHODS: We enrolled 53 patients
      with benign colon diseases (e.g., diverticulosis, benign polyps, Crohn disease,
      ulcerative rectocolitis, colonic endometriosis) and analyzed their peripheral
      blood with 2 previously validated CTC assays: the epithelial immunospot (EPISPOT)
      assay and the CellSearch system. The EPISPOT assay detects only viable,
      CK19-releasing CTCs that were enriched by depletion of CD45(+) leukocytes,
      whereas the CellSearch system detects CK-positive CTCs after positive EpCAM-based
      immunomagnetic enrichment. RESULTS: In patients with benign colon diseases,
      positive events that met the criteria for "tumor cells" were detected with both
      the CellSearch system (11.3%) and the CK19-EPISPOT assay (18.9%), whereas no
      positive events were detected in samples from healthy volunteers. Positive events
      were detected most frequently in patients with diverticulosis and Crohn disease. 
      All positive events lacked expression of CD45, a common leukocyte antigen.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that patients with benign inflammatory colon 
      diseases in particular can harbor viable circulating epithelial cells that are
      detectable with current CTC assays. This finding points to the need for further
      molecular characterization of circulating epithelial cells and has important
      implications for the use of CTC testing.

PG  - 264-9
LID - 10.1007/s12664-011-0145-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) in India is
      increasing. This case-control study was designed to detect associations of
      environmental and dietary factors with the diagnosis of CD. METHODS: In 200
      consecutive patients with CD and 200 control subjects without gastrointestinal
      disease, environmental hygiene exposures in childhood and in the past one year,
      and dietary preferences were recorded using a questionnaire. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were done. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, CD showed
      positive association with urban residence (at birth and current), availability of
      protected drinking water (childhood and current), availability of piped water in 
      the house (childhood and current), and strict vegetarian dietary habit, and
      negative association with regular fish consumption and presence of cattle in the 
      house compound. Multivariate analysis showed that regular fish consumption (OR
      0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.80, p = 0.003), and presence of cattle in the house compound 
      currently (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92, p = 0.023) were significant protective
      associations, whereas use of safe drinking water was positively associated (OR
      1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.47, p = 0.042) with the disease. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of CD
      was associated with dietary and environmental exposures, which indicate that diet
      and hygiene may influence the development of this disease.

      attitudes and prescribing practices of gastroenterologists and surgeons.
PG  - 489-96
LID - 10.1111/j.1751-2980.2011.00534.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various
      gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current 
      attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for
      probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing,
      types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and
      clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were
      mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK.
      RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said 
      they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients,
      including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The
      most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing
      yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more
      popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were
      irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of
      prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants 
      had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their
      routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is
      necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of environmental factors in development of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to assess
      a number of formerly suggested environmental factors in a case-control study of
      an unselected and recently diagnosed group of patients with IBD and a control
      group of orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A total of 123 patients diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and 144 with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Copenhagen
      (2003-2004) were matched 1:1 on age and gender to 267 orthopaedic controls.
      Participants received a questionnaire with 87 questions concerning environmental 
      factors prior to IBD/orthopaedic admission. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Being breastfed >6 months (OR, 0.50; 95% CI,
      0.23-1.11) and undergoing tonsillectomy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78) decreased
      the odds for IBD, whereas appendectomy decreased the odds for UC only (OR, 0.29; 
      95% CI, 0.12-0.71). Vaccination against pertussis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03)
      and polio (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43) increased the odds for IBD, whereas
      measles infection increased the odds for UC (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.6). Low
      consumption of fibres and high consumption of sugar were significantly associated
      with development of CD and UC. Smoking increased the risk for CD and protected
      against UC. CONCLUSION: Among Danish patients with CD and UC belonging to an
      unselected cohort, disease occurrence was found to be associated both with
      well-known factors such as smoking and appendectomy, and with more debated
      factors including breastfeeding, tonsillectomy, childhood vaccinations, childhood
      infections, and dietary intake of fibres and sugar.

      disease.
PG  - 555-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.05.006 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Limited data suggest the absence of infliximab in breast milk,
      thereby implying the safety of this drug during breast-feeding. We aimed to
      re-evaluate the presence of infliximab in breast milk of nursing IBD patients.
      METHODS: Serum and breast milk were obtained post-partum from 3 breast-feeding
      patients with Crohn's disease before and after re-initiation of infliximab. ELISA
      assay was employed to measure infliximab level in maternal serum and in breast
      milk. The level of infliximab was also measured in breast milk of a control group
      of 8 nursing healthy mothers. RESULTS: Infliximab was undetectable in breast milk
      prior to the first infusion and was also not measurable in 8 lactating women not 
      exposed to infliximab. Infliximab levels in breast milk rose up to 101ng/ml
      within 2-3days of the infusion. These levels of infliximab in breast milk were
      roughly 1/200th of the level in blood. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with prior
      reports, infliximab can be detected in the breast milk of nursing mothers. The
      miniscule amounts of infliximab transferred in breast milk are unlikely to result
      in systemic immune-suppression of the infant. Nonetheless, local effects of this 
      exposure on the neonates' intestine and potential immune sensitization or
      tolerization towards the drug can not be excluded and merit further
      investigations.

TI  - Impact of exclusive enteral nutrition on body composition and circulating
      micronutrients in plasma and erythrocytes of children with active Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1672-81
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21916 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is the primary treatment for active pediatric
      Crohn's disease (CD) in the UK/Europe, improving disease activity and
      anthropometry. This study assessed changes in micronutrient status during
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Seventeen children (male/female: 8/9;
      median age: 12.7 years) with active CD were treated exclusively for 6-8 weeks on 
      a polymeric feed (Modulen IBD; Nestle, UK). Body impedance was measured at
      baseline, during EEN, and posttreatment on normal diet and converted to z-scores 
      of fat and lean mass. Blood samples for nutrient analysis were collected from 13 
      children at baseline, end of EEN, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Lean but not fat
      mass improved at the end of EEN (initiation vs. end of EEN; fat mass [z-score]:
      -0.5 vs. -0.3; P = 0.141; lean mass [z-score]: -2.1 vs. -0.8; P < 0.0001). At
      baseline several children presented with suboptimal concentrations of
      carotenoids, trace elements, vitamin C, B6, and folate in plasma but not in
      erythrocytes. EEN improved concentrations for several nutrients, but more than
      90% of patients had depleted concentrations of all carotenoids. The latter
      improved on normal diet but other micronutrients, which improved during EEN,
      returned toward pretreatment concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Lean but not fat mass
      improved at the end of EEN. Median concentrations for several plasma
      micronutrients improved on EEN but carotenoids were depleted. These findings may 
      have implications for clinical practice and producers of enteral feeds. As plasma
      concentrations for many micronutrients can be affected by the acute phase
      response, measurements in erythrocytes may be a better marker of actual body
      stores.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to
      inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and
      its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library
      were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition,
      smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are
      encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts,
      mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from
      meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of
      ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No
      effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total
      energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative
      colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits,
      vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate).
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated
      with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in
      other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended
      in high risk subjects.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic intestinal disease of animals caused by
      Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), which has some pathological
      features similar to Crohn's disease (CD) in humans. The presence of MAP in food
      for human consumption and in affected tissues of patients with CD has been
      detected. Therefore, a causal association between this microorganism and the
      disease in humans, has been postulated. However, several related studies have
      failed to confirm this hypothesis and the scientific acceptance of MAP as a
      zoonotic agent remains controversial. This review presents the main findings
      related to this issue, contrasting evidences for and against an association
      between MAP and CD. The need to promote national studies focusing on this area is
      suggested.

TI  - Glutamine and whey protein improve intestinal permeability and morphology in
      patients with Crohn's disease: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1000-12
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1947-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the
      etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD).
      Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP. AIM: We evaluated 
      the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD.
      METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in
      remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or 
      active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein,
      respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by 
      the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was
      performed by computerized image analysis system. RESULTS: Patients (age 34.5 +/- 
      10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen 
      patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and
      ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively,
      with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1%) patients in each group (P = 1.000).
      The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68
      (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR
      improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P =
      0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063). 
      VCR improved in the GG from 2.33 (0.77) to 2.68 (1.02) (P = 0.001), and in ACG
      from 2.26 (0.57) to 2.49 (0.67) (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal permeability
      and morphology improved significantly in both glutamine and ACG.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms module item development: qualitative methods.
PG  - 664-71
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31823c9b88 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present qualitative study was to develop the
      items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for pediatric patients with
      functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and organic GI diseases, hereafter
      referred to as GI disorders. METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase
      qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to
      generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with
      extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding
      the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 
      5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis],
      gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and
      cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing
      protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods
      involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content
      saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items
      measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines,
      and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients 
      and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for
      the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next
      iterative phase.

AB  - Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis after ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis in ulcerative colitis patients are often refractory to standard
      therapy. Over the last decade, the rational to use probiotics and its beneficial 
      efficacy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasingly under scrutiny. Although it has become clear that intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions and enteric bacteria play a critical role 
      in the development of IBD, the substantial clinical efficacy of probiotics in
      these disorders is less evident. This review outlines the clinical studies
      regarding probiotics before October 2007. These studies formed the foundation of 
      probiotic clinical trials in IBD, but they also indicated the need of larger and 
      better-controlled studies than the past experimental approaches. Furthermore,
      this review also examines in-depth the probiotic clinical trials published
      between 2007 and December 2010, providing new insights into the role of
      probiotics for inducing and maintaining remission of IBD, and highlighting some
      of the breakthroughs, especially regarding induction of remission for ulcerative 
      colitis.

TI  - From gut microflora imbalance to mycobacteria infection: is there a relationship 
      with chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases?
PG  - 361-8
AB  - The gut of a healthy adult harbours a myriad of different microbial species. It
      is estimated that approximately 10 14 are present in total bacterial colony
      forming units (CFU). Each colony colonizes a specific intestinal tract. In
      healthy adult, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs
      through gastric acidity but also other factors can influence the intestinal
      microenvironment such as pH, temperature, competition among different bacterial
      strains, peristalsis, drugs, radiotherapy and much more. Impaired microbial
      homeostasis leads to an alteration of the permeability of tissue, together with
      the activation of the intestinal immune system MALT (mucosal associated lymphoid 
      tissue). In this regard we discuss the increasing experimental evidences of the
      role of commensal microbiota in the activation of specific intestinal
      immunocompetent cells. The aforementioned micro-environmental changes provide the
      substrate for the etiopathogenetic outbreak of numerous pathologies of
      gastro-intestinal tract, such as intestinal chronic inflammation (Crohn's disease
      and Ulcerative Colitis), together with a miscellany of extra intestinal
      disorders. This article is an overview of the latest scientific findings about
      the close causal relationship between intestinal microbial flora and inflammatory
      bowel diseases or other extra-intestinal diseases; it is also mentioned the
      possible relationship between mycobacteria and Chron's disease. Finally we
      analyse the beneficial role of probiotics.

      dendritic cells from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - G1083-92
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00217.2011 [doi]
AB  - Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) is a probiotic yeast that has demonstrated efficacy 
      in pilot studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Microbial
      antigen handling by dendritic cells (DC) is believed to be of critical importance
      for immunity and tolerance in IBD. The aim was to characterize the effects of Sb 
      on DC from IBD patients. Highly purified (>95%), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
      CD1c(+)CD11c(+)CD123(-) myeloid DC (mDC) from patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC; n = 36), Crohn's disease (CD; n = 26), or infectious controls (IC; n = 4)
      were cultured in the presence or absence of fungal supernatant from Sb (SbS).
      Phenotype and cytokine production and/or secretion of IBD mDC were measured by
      flow cytometry and cytometric bead arrays, respectively. T cell phenotype and
      proliferation were assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with allogenic
      CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells from healthy donors. Mucosal healing was
      investigated in epithelial wounding and migration assays with IEC-6 cells. SbS
      significantly decreased the frequency of CD40-, CD80-, and CD197 (CCR7; chemokine
      receptor-7)-expressing IBD mDC and reduced their secretion of tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 while increasing IL-8. In the MLR, SbS 
      significantly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by IBD mDC. Moreover, SbS
      inhibited T(H)1 (TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma) polarization induced by UC mDC
      and promoted IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta-dependent mucosal healing. 
      In summary, we provide novel evidence of synergistic mechanisms how Sb controls
      inflammation (inhibition of T cell costimulation and inflammation-associated
      migration and mobilization of DC) and promotes epithelial restitution relevant in
      IBD.

      publications. In addition, references from publications identified were reviewed.
      STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English identified from the 
      data sources were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: The initial treatment of choice for 
      AIH is prednisone alone or with azathioprine. However, a significant number of
      patients do not respond adequately or have adverse reactions to this regimen;
      therefore, alternative treatments are required. Budesonide is an orally
      administered synthetic corticosteroid with high affinity for the glucocorticoid
      receptor that undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. It has Food and Drug
      Administration-approved labeling for the treatment and maintenance of remission
      of mild-to-moderate Crohn disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon. One
      prospective, active-controlled study of budesonide in the treatment of AIH was
      identified, as well as 5 small open-label studies and 1 retrospective chart
      review. Budesonide appears to have efficacy in the treatment of AIH, including in
      patients intolerant to standard therapy with prednisone alone or with
      azathioprine, with a reduced incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse
      reactions. However, in patients with AIH and cirrhosis, the efficacy of
      budesonide may be reduced and the incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse
      reactions may be increased. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may be an additional
      treatment option for patients with AIH but without cirrhosis who are intolerant
      to standard therapy with prednisone or prednisone with azathioprine.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's disease (CD), involve a
      poorly understood and complex immune response to both the biota of the human gut 
      and the gut itself. The role of the gut biota in human health has been ill
      defined and attitudes toward the intestinal flora have ranged from judging them
      largely irrelevant to declaring them a human organ system. A better way to view
      the intestinal flora is as a group of evolutionarily self-interested species that
      form large, potentially interbreeding populations that utilize human beings as a 
      series of semi-isolated habitats, like islands in an archipelago. Here we propose
      that the imposition of modern sanitation and hygiene standards has drastically
      attenuated the connection between the "islands" inhabited by the gut flora, and
      that existing work drawn from evolutionary biology studies of island ecosystems, 
      rather than medicine, predicts that the evolution of gut flora should now be
      pushed toward limited-dispersion forms of intestinal microorganisms - a
      proposition borne out by the discovery of so-called "adherent invasive
      Escherichia coli." This pathogenic variant of the gut bacterium E. coli clings to
      and invades the intestinal epithelium and has been implicated in CD. Gut flora
      and diseases of the gut should arguably be studied as ecology as much as
      medicine, and treated within this context.

TI  - Effects of dairy products on crohn's disease symptoms are influenced by fat
      content and disease location but not lactose content or disease activity status
      in a New Zealand population.
PG  - 1165-72
LID - 10.1016/j.jada.2011.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products have been perceived as having the potential to cause
      adverse effects in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) and are often avoided,
      potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis and related morbidity associated 
      with inadequate dietary calcium intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the self-reported 
      effects of dairy products on CD symptoms and to determine whether these effects
      differed between types of dairy products consumed and disease state or location. 
      DESIGN: Secondary analysis of dietary survey and clinical data from participants 
      in the Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Disease study based in Auckland, New 
      Zealand. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred and sixty-five men and women diagnosed
      with CD for which both dietary survey data and clinical information were
      available. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: chi(2) analysis was conducted to
      assess whether significant differences in the proportions of responses relating
      to a worsening of CD symptoms from individual dairy products were evident between
      individuals with active or quiescent CD, or ileal or colonic disease locations.
      Odds ratios with confidence interval were calculated to determine whether CD
      location was associated with risk of any type of adverse reaction to milk
      products. Logit scales were utilized to depict self-reported CD symptoms
      associated with individual dairy product consumption for ileal and colonic CD
      patients. RESULTS: Dairy products had no effect on self-reported CD symptoms for 
      most people. Dairy products with a high fat content were most frequently reported
      to worsen perceived CD symptoms. Clinically, self-reported CD activity status did
      not influence responses to dairy products; however, colonic inflammation was more
      frequently associated with adverse CD effects in comparison to ileal CD
      involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Research outcomes question the necessity of dairy
      product avoidance in CD patients and illustrate the highly individual nature of
      dairy product tolerance in this clinical population.

TI  - Serum concentrations of VEGF and TGF-beta1 during exclusive enteral nutrition in 
      IBD.
PG  - 150-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182144c74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of
      treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however,
      its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study
      was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and
      adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents 
      with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 
      healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at 
      the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in
      controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the
      baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P
      < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05).
      During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased
      in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease
      remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD
      during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1
      concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group
      (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving
      remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor
      production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which
      possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.

TI  - The effects of an oral supplement enriched with fish oil, prebiotics, and
      antioxidants on nutrition status in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 463-73
LID - 10.1177/0884533611413778 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) supports
      anti-inflammatory benefits of n-3 fatty acids from fish oil, prebiotics, and
      antioxidants. A nutritionally balanced inflammatory bowel disease nutrition
      formula (IBDNF) enriched with these compounds has the potential to improve
      nutrition status and disease activity in CD. METHODS: This is an open-label pilot
      study investigating the effects of IBDNF on nutrition status in CD patients.
      Twenty-eight patients with active CD on stable medication were asked to consume
      16 oz of IBDNF/d for 4 months. Nutrition status was assessed with dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry scans and serum micronutrient levels. Disease activity and
      quality of life were measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and
      the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Twenty patients
      completed the final visit. After 4 months, there was a significant decrease in
      plasma phospholipid levels of arachidonic acid with increases in eicosapentaenoic
      acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid. Ten patients had a final EPA concentration
      of >2%. There was improvement in fat-free and fat mass in patients with final EPA
      >2% (P = .014 and P = .05). Vitamin D (25-OH) levels improved in all patients
      (18.5-25.9 ng/mL, P < .001). Those with EPA >2% had significantly lower CDAI (116
      +/- 94.5 vs 261.8 +/- 86.5; P = .005) and higher IBDQ (179.1 +/- 26.6 vs 114.6
      +/- 35.9, P < .001) compared to those with EPA <2%. CONCLUSIONS: IBDNF has the
      potential to deposit fat-free and fat mass, improve vitamin D status, and improve
      quality of life in CD patients.

      syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to 
      improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about
      probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they
      consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and
      expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in
      collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted
      with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns
      Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common
      themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred
      thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August
      2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical
      drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option.
      Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their
      gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics,
      their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering 
      probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many
      unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD
      and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy
      advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to
      pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for
      patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits
      and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about
      their use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe a state of
      idiopathic, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main
      phenotypes of IBD are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The major
      cause of IBD-associated mortality is colorectal cancer. Although both
      host-genetic and exogenous factors have been found to be involved, the aetiology 
      of IBD is still not well understood. In this study we characterized thirteen
      Escherichia coli strains from patients with IBD by comparative genomic
      hybridization employing a microarray based on 31 sequenced E. coli genomes from a
      wide range of commensal and pathogenic isolates. RESULTS: The IBD isolates,
      obtained from patients with UC and CD, displayed remarkably heterogeneous genomic
      profiles with little or no evidence of group-specific determinants. No
      IBD-specific genes were evident when compared with the prototypic CD isolate,
      LF82, suggesting that the IBD-inducing effect of the strains is multifactorial.
      Several of the IBD isolates carried a number of extraintestinal pathogenic E.
      coli (ExPEC)-related virulence determinants such as the pap, sfa, cdt and hly
      genes. The isolates were also found to carry genes of ExPEC-associated genomic
      islands. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, these data suggest that E. coli isolates obtained
      from UC and CD patients represents a heterogeneous population of strains, with
      genomic profiles that are indistinguishable to those of ExPEC isolates. Our
      findings indicate that IBD-induction from E. coli strains is multifactorial and
      that a range of gene products may be involved in triggering the disease.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP), excreted in the feces and milk,
      is reported to be not easily inactivated by pasteurization and thermal treatments
      as other bacteria infecting humans and animals do. The D values of all MAP
      strains tested were considerably higher than those published for other pathogens.
      Culturing techniques for this organism are labor intensive. Although an
      increasing amount of scientific evidence suggests that this organism can be
      responsible for at least some cases of Crohn's disease (CD), there is controversy
      about MAP being a cause of CD in humans. In general, although some studies have
      described an association between the presence of MAP and CD, the role of
      Mycobacterium species and MAP in the etiology of this human disease remains
      unestablished. Although published reports indicate that it may not be completely 
      inactivated by pasteurization of milk, the effectiveness of increasing the time
      or temperature in the pasteurization process has not been established and hence
      any potential benefit to human health cannot be determined. This article
      summarizes the incidences of MAP in milk and milk products with respect to human 
      health and brief discussion of various serological as well as molecular
      techniques used for their isolation, enumeration, and characterization.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine with
      pleiotropic effects. Currently, TNF-alpha inhibitors are approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis,
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn
      disease, and ulcerative colitis. We report a patient with seropositive rheumatoid
      arthritis with concurrent primary myelofibrosis, who had transfusion-dependent
      anemia and moderate thrombocytopenia that reversed during treatment with
      adalimumab. Rheumatoid arthritis and myeloproliferative disorder or
      myelodysplastic disorder often coexist, and treatment with standard
      immunosuppressants becomes complex. This report adds to the accumulating evidence
      of the safety of TNF-alpha inhibitors when primary myelofibrosis is present and
      generates discussion for further exploration of the potential therapeutic benefit
      of TNF-alpha inhibitors in cytopenias associated with primary myelofibrosis.

TI  - Clinical utility of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) use probiotics to manage this
      intestinal condition. Despite widespread use of these natural therapies by
      patients, health care providers may be unfamiliar with probiotics as a treatment 
      modality. This review describes the rationale for use of probiotics in IBD, the
      history behind current research directions, and recent controlled clinical
      studies in which efficacy of probiotics has been explored in patients with IBD.
      Emphasis is placed upon critical analysis of study designs for investigations
      that used lactic acid-producing bacteria or Saccharomyces boulardii in management
      of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. While there is suggestion of benefit
      when patients with ulcerative colitis use bacterial therapies and when patients
      with Crohn's disease use S boulardii, small sample sizes and methodological flaws
      in study designs necessitate that additional investigations be conducted before
      probiotics can be routinely recommended in clinical practice.

TI  - Prevalence and management of anemia in children, adolescents, and adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 513-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their
      disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized
      that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and
      adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the
      WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity,
      type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric,
      adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) 
      in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83%
      [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01).
      Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio
      [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric
      clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron
      deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents
      (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none
      had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41%
      (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children 
      than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults
      but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with
      iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy 
      include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including
      worsening of IBD activity.

AB  - Disease-associated undernutrition of all types is very common in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent weight loss remains one of the triad of 
      clinical manifestations and a cornerstone for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease
      (CD), although significantly fewer patients now present as being underweight.
      Recent evidence suggests that the introduction of medical treatment will quickly 
      restore body weight, although this does not reflect concomitant changes in body
      composition. CD children present with features of nutritional cachexia with
      normal fat stores but depleted lean mass. Poor bone health, delayed puberty and
      growth failure are additional features that further complicate clinical
      management. Suboptimal nutritional intake is a main determinant of
      undernutrition, although activation of the immune system and secretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines exert additional independent effects. Biochemically
      low concentrations of plasma micronutrients are commonly reported in IBD
      patients, although their interpretation is difficult in the presence of an acute 
      phase response and other indices of body stores adequacy are needed. Anaemia is a
      common extraintestinal manifestation of the IBD child. Iron-deficient anaemia is 
      the predominant type, with anaemia of chronic disease second. Decreased dietary
      intake, as a result of decreased appetite and food aversion, is the major cause
      of undernutrition in paediatric IBD. Altered energy and nutrient requirements,
      malabsorption and increased gastrointestinal losses are additional factors,
      although their contribution to undernutrition in paediatric CD needs to be
      studied further.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal
      tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs 
      in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is
      unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition,
      environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted 
      a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What
      are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's 
      disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain
      remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of
      surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's
      disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in
      adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What
      are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with
      Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other
      important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety
      of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics,
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral
      nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental
      colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

TI  - Nutritional modulation of the inflammatory bowel response.
PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1159/000323456 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The
      corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment 
      for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. 
      Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various
      chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and
      the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of
      reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of
      the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional
      treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote 
      the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify
      the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction.
      Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a
      significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional
      components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to
      present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the
      management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Aberrant response to commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in Crohn's disease:
      an ex vivo human organ culture study.
PG  - 1201-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human ex vivo evidence indicating that an inappropriate immune
      response(s) to nonpathogenic bacteria contributes to disease pathogenesis in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is limited. The aim of the present study was to
      compare and contrast the early innate immune response of pediatric "healthy"
      versus CD mucosa to pathogenic, probiotic, and commensal bacteria. METHODS:
      "Healthy control" and CD pediatric mucosal biopsies (terminal ileum and
      transverse colon) were cocultured for 8 hours with E. coli O42, Lactobacillus GG 
      (LGG), Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (B. theta), or stimulated with interleukin
      (IL)-1beta (positive control). Matched nonstimulated biopsies served as
      experimental controls. IL-8 was the immune marker of choice. IL-8 mRNA and
      protein levels were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
      sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: IL-8 secretion
      was observed when control, ileal biopsies were exposed to pathogenic O42 and
      probiotic LGG, with no response noted to commensal B. theta. In comparison,
      Crohn's ileal biopsies showed impaired ability to induce IL-8 in response to O42 
      and LGG. Control colonic tissue showed a limited response to O42 or B. theta and 
      LGG significantly reduced IL-8 secretion. Unlike control tissue, however, Crohn's
      ileal and colonic tissue did respond to B. theta, with more enhanced expression
      in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first ex vivo data to support the
      notion that aberrant mucosal recognition of commensal bacteria may contribute to 
      pediatric CD. While IL-8 responses to O42 and LGG varied with disease status and 
      anatomical location, B. theta consistently induced significant IL-8 both in ileal
      and colonic CD tissue, which was not seen in control, healthy tissue.

TI  - Presence of intestinal Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) DNA 
      is not associated with altered MMP expression in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-11-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is suspected to
      be a causative agent in human Crohn's disease (CD). Recent evidence suggests that
      pathogenic mycobacteria and MAP can induce the expression of Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMP), which are the main proteases in the pathogenesis of
      mucosal ulcerations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Within this study we
      assessed the prevalence of intestinal MAP specific DNA in patients with Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy controls. We further analysed
      regulation patterns of MMPs in mucosal tissues of UC patients with and without
      intestinal MAP DNA detection. METHODS: Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 
      63 Norwegian and German IBD patients and 21 healthy controls. RNA was quantified 
      by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study MMP gene
      expression in both pathological and healthy mucosal specimens. The presence of
      MAP DNA in colonic mucosa was examined using MAP specific PCR. RESULTS: MAP DNA
      was detected in 20% of UC patients and 33% of healthy controls but only in 7% of 
      patients with CD. UC patients treated with corticosteroids exhibited a
      significantly increased frequency of intestinal MAP DNA compared to those not
      receiving corticosteroids. Expression of MMP-1, -2, -7, -9, -13, -19, -28 and
      TNF-alpha did not differ between UC patients with presence of intestinal MAP DNA 
      compared to those without. MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 were significantly decreased
      in UC patients receiving corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of intestinal
      MAP specific DNA is not associated with altered MMP expression in UC in vivo.
      Corticosteroids are associated with increased detection of intestinal MAP DNA and
      decreased expression of certain MMPs. Frequent detection of MAP DNA in healthy
      controls might be attributable to the wide environmental distribution of MAP and 
      its presence in the food-chain.

TI  - Dietary intake and risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic
      review of the literature.
PG  - 563-73
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.44 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing.
      Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein
      but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although
      many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has 
      been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using
      guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness
      intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits,
      vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies
      were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and 
      manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD 
      patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) 
      and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high
      intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and
      disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a
      negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk.
      High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were
      associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated
      with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats,
      PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD
      and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and 
      high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.

      METHODS: Newly diagnosed CD children were randomized to EF or PF for 6 weeks.
      Change in the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), fecal
      calprotectin, and plasma fatty acids were measured at 0 and 6 weeks. Patients
      were followed up for 2 years. Time and treatment choice for first relapse were
      documented. RESULTS: Thirty-four children completed the study; EF: 15 (7 M, 8 F),
      PF: 19 (13 M, 6 F). The mean age was (years) EF: 12.6, PF: 11.7. Ninety-three
      percent of children (14/15) achieved remission in the EF group and 79% (15/19) in
      the PF group. One-third of patients maintained remission for 2 years. Mean time
      to relapse (days); EF: 183 (63-286), PF: 162 (53-301). Most children who relapsed
      used feed as a treatment for that relapse (EF: 9/10 and PF: 8/13). With PF, an
      increase of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and alpha linolenic acid was found with a 
      reciprocal decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). With EF, AA and EPA levels were
      reduced with a significant decrease in docosahexaenoic acid. Fecal calprotectin
      measurements decreased significantly but did not normalize at the end of week 6. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between EF and PF in inducing
      remission. One-third of children maintained remission. Changes in plasma
      polyunsaturated fatty acid status were subtle and may be relevant; however,
      further evaluation is recommended.

TI  - A systematic review and economic evaluation of the use of tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, adalimumab and infliximab, for Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1-244
LID - 10.3310/hta15060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a severe, lifelong disease characterised by
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The impact on patients and society
      is high as ill health can be lifelong and can negatively affect patients' quality
      of life. Costs to the NHS are high, particularly for patients needing
      hospitalisation. Conventional treatment pathways are complex. More recently, a
      group of drugs called tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (anti-TNF-alpha
      agents) have been evaluated for their effectiveness in CD. One of these,
      infliximab, is currently recommended by the National Institute for Health and
      Clinical Excellence (NICE; 2002) for patients with severe, active CD where
      patients are refractory to or intolerant of conventional treatment. OBJECTIVES:
      To investigate whether there is evidence for greater clinical effectiveness or
      cost-effectiveness for either adalimumab or infliximab. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane
      Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) 2007 Issue 2; MEDLINE
      (Ovid) 2000 to May/June 2007; MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations
      (Ovid) 4 June and 26 June 2007; EMBASE (Ovid) 2000 to May/June 2007. The European
      Medicines Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration and other relevant
      websites. REVIEW METHODS: Standard systematic review methods were used for study 
      identification and selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Only
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adalimumab or infliximab with
      standard treatment (placebo), RCTs comparing adalimumab with infliximab, or RCTs 
      comparing different dosing regimens of either adalimumab or infliximab in adults 
      and children with moderate-to-severe active CD intolerant or resistant to
      conventional treatment were eligible for inclusion. A systematic review of
      published studies on the cost and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab and infliximab
      was undertaken. The economic models of cost-effectiveness submitted by the
      manufacturers of both drugs were critically appraised and, where appropriate,
      rerun using parameter inputs based on the evidence identified by the authors of
      the technology asessment report. A de novo Markov state transition model was
      constructed to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adalimumab 
      and infliximab therapy compared with standard care. RESULTS: Based on 11 trials, 
      there was evidence from both induction and maintenance trials that both
      adalimumab and infliximab therapy were beneficial compared with placebo (standard
      care) for adults with moderate-to-severe CD and, for infliximab, for adults with 
      fistulising CD; results were statistically significant for some time points.
      Between 6% and 24% (adalimumab), and 21% and 44% (infliximab) more patients
      achieved remission with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies than with placebo in the
      induction trials. Between 24% and 29% (adalimumab), and 14% and 24% (infliximab) 
      more patients achieved remission with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies in the two large 
      maintenance trials at reported follow-up. In fistulising CD, between 29% and 42% 
      (induction trial) and 23% (maintenance trial) more patients achieved a > 50%
      reduction in fistulas with infliximab than with placebo at reported follow-up.
      There was no direct evidence to show that 'responders' were more likely to
      benefit from treatment than 'non-responders' in the longer term. Few differences 
      were found between treatment and standard care arms for selected adverse events, 
      though high proportions of scheduled crossovers resulted in a lack of a true
      placebo group in most of the maintenance trials. No published studies on the
      cost-effectiveness of adalimumab were identified. The four independently funded
      studies identified for infliximab suggested high cost-effectiveness ratios [all
      above pound50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for non-fistulising disease
      and all above pound100,000/QALY for fistulising disease]. A budget impact
      assessment suggested that total cost to the NHS in England and Wales for
      induction in severe disease only could range between pound17M and pound92M and
      for maintenance for 1 year between pound140M and pound200M. LIMITATIONS:
      Regarding clinical effectiveness, there were concerns about the trial design and 
      lack of clarity, which may have affected interpretation of results. None of the
      trials matched exactly the licence indications or NICE guidance, which specify
      the use of these drugs in patients with 'severe' disease. All trials were
      multicentre, and applicability to UK populations, particularly in terms of
      standard care being provided and in terms of patients having failed or having
      become intolerant to conventional treatment, was uncertain. The published
      economic models relied heavily on little information and data from small samples.
      CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy with adalimumab or infliximab may have a beneficial
      effect compared with standard care on outcome measures for induction and
      maintenance. The findings were that for induction, both adalimumab and infliximab
      are cost-effective (dominant relative to standard care) in the management of
      severe CD, and adalimumab (but not infliximab) is cost-effective for moderate CD,
      according to limits generally accepted by NICE. On the basis of the analysis
      presented here, neither drug is likely to be cost-effective as maintenance
      therapy for moderate or severe disease. Perhaps, most importantly, the analysis
      reflected the fact that a substantial number of patients would achieve remission 
      under standard care and that the incidence of relapse among those in remission
      was such that maintenance therapy would have to show greater effectiveness than
      at present and/or be much less costly than it currently is in order to reach the 
      levels of generally accepted cost-effectiveness. Any future trials need to be
      designed to meet the particular challenges of measuring and quantifying benefit
      in this patient group. FUNDING: The research was funded by the HTA programme on
      behalf of NICE.

      Sweden: a questionnaire survey.
PG  - 1018-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02178.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: The general use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as therapy for children
      with Crohn's disease (CD) in Sweden has not previously been studied. Thus, the
      aim of this study was to investigate how EEN is used as therapy in Sweden for
      children with CD. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all 37 paediatric units in
      Sweden that treat children with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The response
      rate was 78%, which covers nearly 90% of Sweden's paediatric population between 0
      and 17 years of age. Ninety-six per cent of the units used EEN as a treatment
      option for children with CD, and 65% of the units used EEN as their primary
      therapy in newly diagnosed CD. The standard duration of EEN was 6 weeks, but the 
      questionnaire revealed a span of 4-8 weeks. The use of polymeric formula was just
      as common as a combination of polymeric and elemental formulas. Fifty-seven per
      cent used oral nutrition supplements, and 81% allowed some extent of concomitant 
      feeding, the addition of food and fluids, during EEN. All units used enteral
      nutrition to some extent as maintenance therapy after EEN was discontinued.
      CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, EEN is used as therapy for children with Crohn's disease 
      (CD), but the EEN protocols vary as to choice of formula and type of food and
      fluids allowed during EEN. Standardized EEN protocols would enable multicentre
      studies in Sweden, with the objective of investigating how EEN treatment can be
      improved and employed in the most efficient way.

      active Crohn's disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The commensal intestinal microbiota drive the inflammation
      associated with Crohn's disease. However, bacteria such as bifidobacteria and
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii appear to be immunoregulatory. In healthy subjects
      the intestinal microbiota are influenced by prebiotic carbohydrates such as
      fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). Preliminary data suggest that FOS increase faecal 
      bifidobacteria, induce immunoregulatory dendritic cell (DC) responses and reduce 
      disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. AIMS AND METHODS: To assess
      the impact of FOS in patients with active Crohn's disease using an adequately
      powered randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with predefined
      clinical, microbiological and immunological end points. Patients with active
      Crohn's disease were randomised to 15 g/day FOS or non-prebiotic placebo for 4
      weeks. The primary end point was clinical response at week 4 (fall in Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index of >/= 70 points) in the intention-to-treat (ITT)
      population. RESULTS: 103 patients were randomised to receive FOS (n = 54) or
      placebo (n = 49). More patients receiving FOS (14 (26%) vs 4 (8%); p = 0.018)
      withdrew before the 4-week end point. There was no significant difference in the 
      number of patients achieving a clinical response between the FOS and placebo
      groups in the ITT analysis (12 (22%) vs 19 (39%), p = 0.067). Patients receiving 
      FOS had reduced proportions of interleukin (IL)-6-positive lamina propria DC and 
      increased DC staining of IL-10 (p < 0.05) but no change in IL-12p40 production.
      There were no significant differences in the faecal concentration of
      bifidobacteria and F prausnitzii between the groups at baseline or after the
      4-week intervention. CONCLUSION: An adequately powered placebo-controlled trial
      of FOS showed no clinical benefit in patients with active Crohn's disease,
      despite impacting on DC function. ISRCTN50422530.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes the disease of cattle,
      Johne's. The economic impact of this disease includes early culling of infected
      cattle, reduced milk yield, and weight loss of cattle sold for slaughter. There
      is a possible link between MAP and Crohn's disease, a human inflammatory bowel
      disease. MAP is also a potential human food borne pathogen because it survives
      current pasteurization treatments. We review the current knowledge of MAP,
      Johne's disease and Crohn's disease and note directions for future work with this
      organism including rapid and economical detection, effective management plans and
      preventative measures.

TI  - Practice patterns in the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents in the
      management of Crohn's disease: a US national practice survey comparing experts
      and non-experts.
PG  - 1160-4
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1530-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration currently approves three types of
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy for treatment of
      moderate to severe Crohn's disease. There are no guidelines to clarify which of
      the drugs may be better suited to individual clinical scenarios. AIMS: We
      gathered national data on the prescribing pattern, comfort levels, and algorithms
      gastroenterologists use for management of their biologic-requiring Crohn's
      disease patients. METHODS: An internet survey was mailed to members of the
      American Gastroenterology Association. Responses were separated into "non-expert"
      and "expert" physician groups on the basis of whether a practice consisted of
      >50% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared experts with
      non-experts with regard to the use of the three anti-TNF agents, attitudes
      regarding their relative efficacy, and their experience with adverse events.
      RESULTS: Of 3,990 eligible gastroenterologists, 473 replied in full (11.9%).
      Sixty (12.6%) respondents met the criterion for IBD expert physician. Experts
      were comfortable using both immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha therapy. Community
      physicians were equally comfortable prescribing 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine,
      infliximab, and adalimumab, but less comfortable than experts with methotrexate
      (56 vs. 86%, P<0.05) and certolizumab (68 vs. 89%, P<0.05). Expert physicians
      were much more likely to have encountered adverse reactions to anti-TNFalpha
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that experts are more comfortable using
      a broader array of medical therapy than non-expert physicians. Although both
      groups had similar concerns regarding side-effects of anti-TNFalpha therapy,
      expert physicians were much more likely to have managed a broad range of
      complications in their patient population.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence: an update
      for a new decade.
PG  - 95-100
LID - 10.1007/s11894-010-0152-x [doi]
AB  - Poorly controlled Crohn's disease (CD) often requires surgery for such
      complications as strictures, fistulas, and abscesses. The goal of postoperative
      treatment is to suppress or prevent inflammation and maintain mucosal healing.
      Probiotics, antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and antibodies to 
      tumor necrosis factor are all used to prevent postoperative recurrence. In this
      article, recent studies are reviewed. Azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine are
      moderately effective at preventing and treating postoperative CD, whereas
      infliximab/adalimumab are highly effective and probiotics and 5-aminosalicylates 
      minimally effective. We base the choice of postoperative medical therapy on the
      patient's risk profile for postoperative recurrence. Whatever postoperative
      therapy is used, the mucosa should be assessed within 12 months to determine if
      the approach is effective. If active inflammation is found, then treatment should
      be intensified. By treating CD aggressively after a first surgery, future
      surgeries can be delayed or averted.

TI  - Food-specific IgG4-guided exclusion diets improve symptoms in Crohn's disease: a 
      pilot study.
PG  - 1009-13
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02373.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Exclusion diets have been shown to prolong remission in Crohn's disease
      (CD). We assessed IgG4-targeted exclusion diets in patients with CD. METHOD:
      Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for
      IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most
      reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a
      modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were
      measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients
      did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported 
      symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P =
      0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the 
      excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION:
      IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with 
      an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in
      clinical practice.
