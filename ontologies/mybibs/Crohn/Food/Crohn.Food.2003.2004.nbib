TI  - Efficacy of pasteurization conditions for the inactivation of Mycobacterium avium
      subsp. paratuberculosis in milk.
PG  - 2719-26
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the causative agent of a chronic
      enteritis in ruminants (Johne's disease), has been linked to Crohn's disease in
      humans. This microorganism is shed by infected animals primarily in the feces but
      is also shed in the milk at much lower levels. Therefore, dairy products from
      infected animals may be one mode of transmission of this animal pathogen. This
      study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the holder and
      high-temperature short-time pasteurization standards on the destruction of M.
      paratuberculosis. One hundred eighty experiments were conducted in this study
      using a slug-flow pasteurizer unit and a laboratory scale pasteurizer unit.
      Ultrahigh-temperature milk was inoculated at two concentrations, 10(8) and 10(5) 
      CFU/ml, with three different field strains of M. paratuberculosis. Five different
      time-temperature combinations were evaluated: 62.7 degrees C for 30 min, 65.5
      degrees C for 16 s, 71.7 degrees C for 15 s, 71.7 degrees C for 20 s, and 74.4
      degrees C for 15 s. Three replicates of each experiment were run for the
      pasteurizer unit, time-temperature combination, and strain of M.
      paratuberculosis. Treatment of milk regardless of bacterial strain or pasteurizer
      unit resulted in an average 5.0- and 7.7-log kill for the low and high
      concentrations of inoculum, respectively. Milk treated for cheese production
      (65.5 degrees C for 16 s) resulted in a much lower and more variable kill.
      Results from this study indicate that the current U.S. minimum standards for
      batch and high-temperature short-time pasteurization of grade A milk
      significantly reduced the survivability of M. paratuberculosis, but some bacteria
      survived subpasteurization heat treatment of milk used for cheese manufacture.

TI  - Dietary sources of inorganic microparticles and their intake in healthy subjects 
      and patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 947-55
AB  - Dietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Endogenous 
      sources are derived from intestinal Ca and phosphate secretion. Exogenous sources
      are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant
      to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is
      some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However,
      whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been
      studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in
      subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general
      practice-based controls (ninety-one per group) completed 7 d food diaries. Intake
      data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controls. All foods,
      pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and
      intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups. 
      Dietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for
      dietary fibre (12 (SD 5) v. 14 (SD 5) g/d; P=0.001) and sucrose (52 (SD 27) v. 45
      (SD 18) g/d; P=0.04) but not for Ca. Estimated median TiO2 and Psil intakes (2.5 
      and 35 mg/individual per d respectively, totalling 10(12)-10(13)
      microparticles/individual per d) were broadly similar to per capita estimates and
      while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no
      significant difference between subjects with CD and controls. Hence, if exposure 
      to microparticles is associated with the inflammation of CD, then the present
      study rules out excess intake as the problem. Nonetheless,
      microparticle-containing foods have now been identified which allows a
      low-microparticle diet to be further assessed in CD.

TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus induces peripheral hyporesponsiveness in stimulated CD4+ 
      T cells via modulation of dendritic cell function.
PG  - 1618-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is widely recognized that the intake of so-called
      probiotic microorganisms is beneficial in chronic mucosal inflammation and
      topical allergic disease, the immunologic details explaining how such bacteria
      can exert these effects remain obscure. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus can modulate T cell responses in vitro and in vivo.
      DESIGN: In vitro, human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) matured in the
      presence of L. rhamnosus were used to instruct naive CD4+ T cells; subsequently, 
      the T cell response was assessed with the use of CD3/CD28 and interleukin (IL) 2.
      Cytokine production by ex vivo-stimulated naive cells and memory T cells was
      measured before and after oral supplementation with L. rhamnosus in 6 healthy
      volunteers and 6 patients with Crohn disease. RESULTS: A decreased T cell
      proliferation and cytokine production, especially of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, was
      observed in CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells derived from L. rhamnosus-matured DCs.
      This T cell hyporesponsiveness was associated with enhanced DC-T cell interaction
      and normal responsiveness of T cells for IL-2. In vivo oral supplementation of L.
      rhamnosus for 2 wk induced a similar T cell hyporesponsiveness, including
      impaired ex vivo T helper subsets 1 and 2 responses without up-regulation of
      immunoregulatory cytokines in cohorts of both healthy volunteers and patients
      with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that L. rhamnosus modulates DC
      function to induce a novel form of T cell hyporesponsiveness; this mechanism
      might be an explanation for the observed beneficial effects of probiotic
      treatment in clinical disease.

TI  - Adalimumab: human recombinant immunoglobulin g1 anti-tumor necrosis factor
      monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 196-210
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is involved with
      normal inflammatory and immune responses and with the pathogenesis of chronic
      inflammatory medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic
      arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Crohn's disease. The newest therapies for these 
      inflammatory conditions include the TNF biologic response modifiers infliximab,
      etanercept, and adalimumab. Adalimumab is a human recombinant immunoglobulin G1
      anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. As monotherapy, or in combination with methotrexate
      or other traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, adalimumab can
      produce improvements in the signs and symptoms associated with rheumatoid
      arthritis and can slow progression of the joint destruction. The adverse effect
      profile of adalimumab seems to be comparable to that of etanercept. Adalimumab
      also seems to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and
      Crohn's disease; however, none of these indications are approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration, and the optimal dosing regimen for these indications has
      not been established.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of tumor necrosis factor antagonists in Crohn's disease:
      overview of randomized clinical studies.
PG  - S18-24
AB  - The past decade has brought forth a series of novel biologic agents targeting
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for the treatment of Crohn's disease. The
      introduction of infliximab has paved the way for additional anti-TNF strategies
      that have the potential to build on that drug's efficacy and safety profile.
      However, the anti-TNF strategies might not have identical efficacy and safety
      profiles and might differ in dosing compared with therapy for rheumatoid
      arthritis. Most recently, adalimumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and is undergoing
      evaluation in Crohn's disease, with promising initial results. This review
      discusses the results of controlled clinical trials of anti-TNF agents for
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: dysfunction of GALT and gut bacterial flora (II).
PG  - 125-36
AB  - The precise cause(s) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown. From 
      animal models and human studies it is well established that gut bacterial flora
      are essential for inducing the bowel inflammation. Animal models, when kept in a 
      germ-free environment, do not develop colitis until the gut flora is
      reconstituted. It is not clear whether the bacterial antigens (Ags) from the
      normal flora or some other pathogenic bacterial Ags induce/propagate the
      inflammatory process in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite extensive
      research it has not been possible to identify any specific bacteria or virus as a
      credible cause of IBD. Recent understanding of quorum sensing molecules (QSMs)
      secreted by bacteria helps to explain the community behaviour in bacterial
      species. When QSMs reach a defined concentration, they activate bacterial
      proliferation and a number of virulence genes. Also, these molecules have been
      found to modulate the immune system to the advantage of the gut bacteria. They
      have not been well studied, however, in the gut. Inappropriate secretion of QSMs 
      may alter the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and, thereby, deregulate the 
      immune tolerance normally present. Usefulness of probiotics and their immune
      modulating effects are being increasingly reported. Probiotics are also being
      used in the treatment of IBD. The interaction between the epithelial cells and
      the gut flora is very important as this is the first line of contact; this
      interaction may determine the induction of tolerance and mucosal integrity or
      immune activity, tissue inflammation and abnormal permeability. The latter is
      documented in patients with IBD and their healthy relatives. This may be an
      important factor in disruption of mucosal integrity and GALT dysfunction.

      to ascertain the frequency of use by a group of children with proven inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) and to consider the reasons for their use. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was sent by mail to the parents of patients currently attending a
      paediatric IBD clinic. Parents were asked to describe their child's usage of
      alternative and probiotic therapies and to comment on a number of aspects of such
      therapies. RESULTS: Forty-six (77%) of 60 mailed questionnaires were returned.
      The mean age of the children was 10.9 (+/- 4.1) years and they were taking an
      average of 1.7 (+/- 0.8) prescribed medications. Thirty-three (72%) of the
      children were said by their parents to be having CAM, with four having five or
      more such therapies (average 2.4 +/- 1.3 agents per child). The most commonly
      used agents were probiotics (78%) and fish oils (56%). A minority (12%) of
      respondents reported that their child's CAM was very effective, although many
      (50%) noted partial benefits. The 13 children who had never used any CAM
      therapies ('non-users') did not differ from the 'users' in terms of gender, age, 
      disease or duration of disease. As expected, non-users expressed greater concerns
      about use of CAM and described different attitudes towards such therapies.
      CONCLUSION: Complementary and alternative medicines, especially probiotic
      therapies, frequently are administered to children and adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Often this appears to be due to parental frustration 
      with managing their child's chronic illness. Practitioners caring for children
      and adolescents with IBD need to be aware that their patients may be using
      alternative therapies and adopt an open attitude in this situation.

TI  - [Environmental factors in the etiopathology of inflammatory bowel syndrome].
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a
      tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has
      increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development
      and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory
      (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors.
      Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive
      enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are
      impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of
      secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine,
      somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal 
      mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and
      activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet,
      smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are
      jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined
      dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances
      in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.

TI  - Vitamin K status in patients with Crohn's disease and relationship to bone
      turnover.
PG  - 2178-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's 
      disease (CD). There is some evidence that a deficiency of certain bone-active
      nutrients (including vitamins K and D) may have a partial role in this bone loss.
      AIMS: To compare the intake and the status of vitamin K in CD patients, currently
      in remission, with age- and sex-matched controls, and furthermore to investigate 
      the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients.
      SUBJECTS: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 yr) and matched controls (n = 44)
      were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area,
      respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analyzed for the total and undercarboxylated
      (Glu)-osteocalcin and urine analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I
      collagen (NTx). Vitamin K(1) intake was estimated by food frequency
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Vitamin K(1) intake in CD patients tended to be lower
      than that of controls (mean (SD), 117 (82) vs 148 (80) mug/d, respectively; p=
      0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than controls (mean
      (SD), 5.1 (3.1) vs 3.9 (2.1) ng/ml, respectively; p= 0.03 for Glu; and 49 (41) vs
      25.8 (19.5) nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p= 0.001 for NTx). In CD
      patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r= 0.488; p < 0.001), even
      after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and
      corticosteroid use. CONCLUSION: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than
      that of the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in the CD 
      was inversely correlated with vitamin K status, suggesting that it might be
      another etiological factor for CD-related osteopenia.

TI  - Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison with soy oil.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty
      acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to
      compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with
      IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had
      ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was
      self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. 
      RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the
      duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035),
      intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease
      activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the
      effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for
      the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment
      suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint
      pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition.
      Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid 
      to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on
      IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).

TI  - Fish oil and antioxidants alter the composition and function of circulating
      mononuclear cells in Crohn disease.
PG  - 1137-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is associated with osteoporosis and other
      extraintestinal manifestations that might be mediated by cytokines from
      circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fish oil rich in
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces disease
      activity in patients with CD with raised laboratory markers of inflammation and
      in healthy subjects alters PBMC function. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect
      of fish oil plus antioxidants on cytokine production by PBMCs from patients with 
      CD with raised C-reactive protein concentrations (>/=6.9 mg/L) or erythrocyte
      sedimentation rates (>/=18 mm/h). DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled trial
      of fish oil (2.7 g EPA and DHA/d; n = 31) or placebo (olive oil; n = 31) for 24
      wk was conducted in patients with CD. The fish-oil group additionally received an
      antioxidant preparation (vitamins A, C, and E and selenium). Exclusion criteria
      included corticosteroid use. Fatty acid composition was measured by gas
      chromatography. Production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma
      (IFN-gamma), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays after stimulation with mitogen and endotoxin
      (lipopolysaccharide). RESULTS: Fish-oil plus antioxidant dietary supplementation 
      was associated with higher EPA and DHA incorporation into PBMCs (P < 0.001) and
      lower arachidonic acid (P = 0.006) and lower production of IFN-gamma by
      mitogen-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.012) and of PGE(2) by
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Dietary
      supplementation with fish oil plus antioxidants is associated with modified PBMC 
      composition and lower production of PGE(2) and IFN-gamma by circulating monocytes
      or macrophages. The response of extraintestinal manifestations of CD should be
      investigated in a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Culture of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis from the blood of
      patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1039-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, resembles some
      aspects of tuberculosis, leprosy, and paratuberculosis. The role of Mycobacterium
      avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      METHODS: We tested for MAP by PCR and culture in buffy coat preparations from 28 
      individuals with Crohn's disease, nine with ulcerative colitis, and 15 without
      inflammatory bowel disease. FINDINGS: MAP DNA in uncultured buffy coats was
      identified by PCR in 13 (46%) individuals with Crohn's disease, four (45%) with
      ulcerative colitis, and three (20%) without inflammatory bowel disease. Viable
      MAP was cultured from the blood of 14 (50%) patients with Crohn's disease, two
      (22%) with ulcerative colitis, and none of the individuals without inflammatory
      bowel disease. Current use of immunosuppressive medication did not correlate with
      a positive MAP culture. Sequencing of PCR products from MAP cultures confirmed
      the presence of the MAP-specific IS900 fragment. Among 11 MAP isolates assessed, 
      we identified nine strains that were not identical. INTERPRETATION: We detected
      viable MAP in peripheral blood in a higher proportion of individuals with Crohn's
      disease than in controls. These data contribute to the evidence that MAP might be
      a cause of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Bacterial colonization and the development of intestinal defences.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - In humans, intestinal defences develop during gestation and, at full term, have
      the capacity to respond in an appropriate manner to infectious agents and foreign
      antigens. Before an active protective response can occur, however, the gut must
      first be exposed to colonizing bacteria. Colonization with diverse intestinal
      microbes is necessary for the development of important gut defenses such as the
      synthesis and secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A and the generation of a
      balanced T helper (Th) cell response. Insights into normal immune physiological
      development of the gut have been made by studying the germ-free animal and
      intestinal defenses. These studies have provided insights into the physiology of 
      immune responses. Two important immunological functions are the secretion of
      polymeric immunoglobulin A to protect the intestinal surface against harmful
      stimuli and inhibition of the systemic response to commensal bacteria and food
      proteins (eg, oral tolerance) to prevent chronic inflammation. Neither function
      exists in the germ-free state, but rapidly develops after conventionalization
      (colonization) of the germ-free animal. In the present review, the importance of 
      bacterial colonization on the appearance of normal mucosal immune function and to
      the clinical consequences of inadequate colonization to the development of
      disease will be discussed. For example, excessive Th2 activity can lead to atopy,
      whereas Th1 predominance is found in conditions such as Helicobacter pylori
      gastritis and Crohn's disease. With the eradication of infectious diseases in
      developed countries in the past three decades, the incidence of atopic and
      autoimmune diseases has increased. This epidemiological observation has been
      explained by the 'hygiene hypothesis', which suggests that a reduction in
      microbial burden by public health measures has contributed to an immunological
      imbalance in the intestine. A family of pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like 
      receptors) on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells mediates innate immune responses 
      to bacterial molecular patterns and, thereby, orchestrates acquired immunity. As 
      the role of bacterial communication within the gut (bacterial-epithelial
      cross-talk) is clarified, physicians should be able to modulate gut immune
      responses, for example, by the use of probiotics.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of budesonide (Entocort EC) capsules for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 803-21
AB  - This overview summarises available pharmacokinetic data on budesonide capsules
      (Entocort EC), approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate active Crohn's
      disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon and for prolongation of
      symptom control. Budesonide is a locally-acting glucocorticosteroid with an
      extensive, primarily hepatic, metabolism after oral administration. It is rapidly
      absorbed and biotransformed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A to metabolites with
      negligible glucocorticoid activity. Entocort EC, a pH- and time-dependent oral
      formulation of budesonide, was developed to optimise drug delivery to the ileum
      and throughout the colon. Pharmaco-scintigraphic studies have confirmed that the 
      Entocort EC formulation delays budesonide absorption and prolongs the rate of
      elimination but maintains complete absorption. This improves the delivery of
      budesonide to the intestinal lumen relative to a plain formulation. A low
      systemic availability of 9-21% indicates extensive first-pass elimination. Food
      appears to have little impact on the absorption of budesonide from Entocort EC
      capsules and the pharmacokinetics are dose-proportional between 3 and 15 mg. On
      average, systemic availability was 2.5-fold higher in patients with cirrhosis
      compared with healthy controls; however, mild liver impairment had little effect 
      on systemic exposure. Pharmacokinetics appear unaffected by gender and age,
      although this has not been tested in younger children. Renal impairment is not
      expected to have an impact on the kinetics of Entocort EC. Budesonide is unlikely
      to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, including CYP3A4 substrates, mainly
      because of the very low plasma concentrations obtained with the compound even
      after high doses of Entocort trade mark EC capsules. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors,
      such as ketoconazole, will inhibit the metabolism of budesonide, resulting in
      several-fold increases in the area under the concentration-time curve of
      budesonide. Also, grapefruit juice intake may increase systemic availability of
      budesonide, probably by inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 activity. Unlike
      prednisolone, oral contraceptives do not alter plasma budesonide concentrations. 
      An increased pH obtained by gastric acid inhibitory drugs, such as omeprazole,
      does not affect the pharmacokinetics of budesonide. In summary, budesonide
      capsules (Entocort EC) possess many pharmacological features that make the
      formulation well adapted for a targeted treatment of inflammatory disorders, such
      as Crohn's disease involving the ileum and ascending colon.

TI  - Review article: chronic active disease and maintaining remission in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 102-5
AB  - The clinical management of Crohn's disease can be considered in relation to the
      treatment of acute disease and the maintenance of remission. The medication used 
      to achieve these two goals may or may not be the same. Some patients with mildly 
      active disease may respond to high-dose (4 g/day) mesalazine (mesalamine), and
      5-aminosalicylic acid may also be helpful in weaning a patient off steroids after
      treatment for a flare-up. However, the value of 5-aminosalicylic acid in
      maintaining remission in Crohn's disease remains controversial. Subgroups of
      patients may be helped: for example, patients with Crohn's disease who have
      experienced a relapse within the last 2 years may benefit. Steroids form the
      first-line therapy for acute episodes of inflammation but do not maintain
      remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the first-line drugs for the
      maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and by titrating 
      the dose up from 2 mg/kg daily, some previously resistant patients will be
      brought into remission. One-half of patients who do not tolerate azathioprine
      will tolerate mercaptopurine. Methotrexate is effective in inducing and
      maintaining remission, and is useful for patients who fail azathioprine
      treatment. Thalidomide is not proven in controlled studies, but two open studies 
      have demonstrated its efficacy. The optimal dose, however, remains to be defined.
      Purified liquid diets with food exclusion can induce remission in patients with
      active disease, but food exclusion is difficult to maintain long term. Infliximab
      can induce and maintain remission in patients resistant to other therapies, with 
      two-thirds of patients initially responding to treatment. One-third go into
      remission and, of those who respond to a single treatment, approximately one-half
      maintain remission when treated regularly for a year. Infliximab is, however,
      associated with an increased risk of infection, and its effect on cancer
      incidence is uncertain. The development of antibodies against the drug is
      associated with a loss of effect and allergic infusion reactions. In summary,
      simple proven therapies should be used first, because of their safety and benefit
      in some patients. However, aggressive therapy should be used when needed.

TI  - Review article: the role of nutrition in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at
      least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal
      role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the
      uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals.
      Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore
      influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes,
      nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response,
      such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition 
      of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence
      cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical
      data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary
      composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both
      children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception
      of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these
      deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological
      significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to
      defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against
      damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These 
      events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as
      in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary
      manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
      and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an
      effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient
      patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary
      therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active
      nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of
      clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Review article: antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - Treatment with antibiotics in inflammatory bowel disease has a long tradition and
      is widely used. The indications for antibiotic therapy are wide ranging, from
      specific situations such as abscesses or fistulae, to patients with severe
      disease (as an unspecific 'protective' measure), and to address the hypothesis
      that the enteric flora as a whole, or specific microorganisms such as
      mycobacteria, are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      best-studied single antibiotic compound is metronidazole. However, overall, the
      scientific basis for the use of antibiotics is limited, which may reflect a lack 
      of interest from sponsors within the pharmaceutical industry. Despite this weak
      evidence base, antibiotics are a globally established therapeutic tool in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Growing evidence from human and animal studies points
      towards a pivotal pathogenetic role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel 
      disease. In view of these experimental findings, clinical trials have been
      undertaken to elucidate the therapeutic effects of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease. Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms which confer
      health benefits to the host by improving the microbial balance of the indigenous 
      microflora. So far, of the many candidates, one specific strain (Escherichia coli
      Nissle 1917) and a mixture of eight different bacteria have demonstrated
      convincing therapeutic efficacy in controlled studies. Maintenance therapy in
      ulcerative colitis and prevention therapy, as well as the treatment of pouchitis,
      have emerged as areas in which probiotic therapy offers a valid therapeutic
      alternative to current treatments. Further investigations may detect additional
      clinically effective probiotics and other clinical indications.

TI  - Allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis in a child with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 159-61
AB  - A case of a child with Crohn's disease who developed an eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis is reported. Although symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis at
      age 8 could mimic those of Crohn's disease, laboratory, radiographic and
      histologically studies are clearly different. Peripheral blood eosinophilia
      (7,476 cells per mm3), high serum IgE level (1,050 kU/l) and normal C-reactive
      protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are common in eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis and uncommon in Crohn's disease. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis was
      due to bovine serum albumin (BSA) hypersensitivity, confirmed with skin tests,
      serum levels to specific IgE and a SDS-PAGE IgE-immunoblotting. A strict
      meat-free diet was started, with progressive relief of symptoms and decrease of
      eosinophil count twelve months later; the patient became fully symptom-free and
      eosinophil count was normal.

TI  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fatty acid composition and inflammatory
      mediator production in adult Crohn's disease.
PG  - 647-55
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with nutritional
      deficiencies, altered plasma concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
      and an anti-inflammatory response to fish oil that contains n-3 PUFA. This
      suggests that, in CD, immune cells may have altered n-3 PUFA composition with
      functional consequences. The aim of this study is to investigate n-3 and n-6 PUFA
      composition and synthetic function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      in the basal state. METHODS: A case control study of 52 adult CD patients and
      healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Composition of PBMC and plasma
      phospholipids were measured by gas chromatography and production of tumour
      necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
      by PBMC were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: CD was associated with higher
      concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and other n-3 PUFA, and lower arachidonic
      acid (AA) (n-6 PUFA) in PBMC. This was not explained by differences in dietary
      fat intake. Lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma by PBMC were noted in
      quiescent and active CD, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: CD is
      associated with a greater availability, and not a deficiency, of n-3 PUFA in
      PBMC, but lower concentrations of AA, and lower rates of production of PGE2 and
      IFN-gamma, compared to healthy controls.

TI  - Probiotics and the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 286-99
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of
      probiotics beyond simple barrier and antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic
      mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been
      elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial 
      pathogens for a limited number of receptors present on the surface epithelium;
      (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response of gut-associated
      lymphoid and epithelial cells; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of
      pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier function; and (5) induction of T cell
      apoptosis in the mucosal immune compartment. The unraveling of these mechanisms
      of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of
      clinical inflammatory bowel disease. Though level 1 evidence now supports the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of postoperative pouchitis, only
      levels 2 and 3 evidence is currently available in support of the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged during the
      course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar
      therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials are vital to
      investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use,
      single or multi-strain formulation, and the concomitant use of probiotics,
      synbiotics, or antibiotics.

TI  - [Natural therapy instead of chemistry? Probiotics in gastroenterology].
PG  - 13-7
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that upon ingestion exert health benefits.
      The impact of probiotics on gut flora represents a new and interesting
      therapeutic approach in a number of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
      According to actual publications and guidelines of medical societies, the
      clinical relevance of probiotics can be described as follows: (a) In the case of 
      ulcerative colitis, available data demonstrate benefits of probiotic therapy. (b)
      The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect
      seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics
      is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before 
      probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome
      have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been
      encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and
      therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.

      disease.
PG  - 1050-2
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Enteral nutrition is the currently established primary therapy
      for Crohn's disease in Japan. We examined the effects of postoperative
      nutritional therapy in patients with perforating type and non-perforating type
      Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 218
      patients who underwent surgical interventions for Crohn's disease in our hospital
      between January 1, 1974 and September 30, 2001. They were divided into four
      groups: 92 patients in the non-perforating type (NP type) + Elemental Diet (ED)
      group had received ED therapy and nutritional education, 22 patients in the NP
      type + NoED group had not received ED therapy or nutritional education, 88
      patients in the perforating type (P type) + ED group and 16 patients in P type + 
      NoED group. We evaluated the incidence of reoperation rate for each group.
      RESULTS: Patients with a postoperative ED therapy demonstrated a significant
      decrease in the incidence of second resection. The incidence of second resection 
      in the NP type + ED group was significantly lower than that of the other groups. 
      The NP type + NoED group and the P type + ED group followed similar courses.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease postoperative ED therapy and
      nutritional education is effective in reducing the incidence of second resection.
      It appears that postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is more
      important in patients with P type Crohn's disease.

TI  - Microflora in inflammatory bowel diseases: a pediatric perspective.
PG  - S91-3
AB  - Several lines of evidence link inflammatory bowel diseases to modifications of
      intestinal microflora. Epidemiologic and clinical data suggest a triggering role 
      for select agents in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease. Experimental
      evidence indicates that intestinal microorganisms are needed for developing
      intestinal inflammation in IL-10 knockout mice, and this is associated with an
      increased number of adherent clostridia and a decrease of lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria. It may be hypothesized that a host-agent-specific relationship
      leads to an abnormal immune response, which may be genetically driven in select
      inflammatory bowel diseases. However, different from adults, the pattern of
      intestinal microflora undergoes profound changes during the early stage of life, 
      contributing to the development of the immune system. A close relationship exists
      between microbiologic and immunologic imprinting. The microbiologic imprinting in
      neonates may be modified using bacterial probiotics that colonize the intestine, 
      modify the immune response, and decrease the risk for atopy. Probiotics may
      decrease the recurrences of inflammatory bowel diseases. Preliminary evidence of 
      intestinal antiinflammatory effects has been detected in children with cystic
      fibrosis. Overall these data provide the rationale to investigate the interaction
      between intestinal microflora and the local and general immune response in
      children with, or at risk for, inflammatory bowel diseases. This approach may be 
      a key for understanding the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation and may
      disclose novel strategies to educate better the immune system, particularly
      during its developmental stage.

TI  - Immune sensitization to yeast antigens in ASCA-positive patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alimentary antigens may play a role in the perpetuation of
      inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). Yeast antigens are widespread components of
      food. A proportion of CD patients develop antibodies against the yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), but little is known about the cellular immune
      reactivity against food antigens in antibody-positive and -negative patients.
      METHODS: Lymphocytes from patients with CD, ulcerative colitis, and healthy
      controls were tested for their proliferative response after stimulation with the 
      yeast antigen mannan and ovalbumin. The cellular phenotypes and activation
      markers were analyzed via FACS. Cytokine concentrations and antibody titers were 
      determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Only lymphocytes of ASCA-positive patients with CD 
      proliferated after stimulation with mannan. These lymphocytes expressed increased
      activation markers (CD25, CD69). Activation of T cells was mediated by
      antigen-presenting cells and was associated with increased tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. The immune reactivity to ovalbumin was
      predominantly found in CD patients. It was weaker compared with mannan,
      independent of ASCA status, and also present in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      disturbed humoral and cellular response to the yeast antigen mannan is
      specifically seen in a subgroup of CD patients. This phenomenon may be due to a
      loss of tolerance toward yeast and is possibly genetically determined.

TI  - Environmental risk factors (excluding tobacco and microorganisms): critical
      analysis of old and new hypotheses.
PG  - 497-508
AB  - The increase in incidence in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease during
      the 20th century has led to an abundance of different hypotheses on what sort of 
      exposures are responsible. There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as 
      well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast
      food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of
      this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational 
      studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research
      agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious
      exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better
      hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral
      contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into
      the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - The metabolic activity of fecal microbiota from healthy individuals and patients 
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - The hypothesis was studied that intestinal microbial metabolites play a role in
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. For that purpose, an in vitro
      model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and
      eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over
      time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation.
      Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more 
      short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals.
      Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after
      inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with
      microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all
      microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially
      toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory
      bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from
      these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.

TI  - Elemental versus polymeric enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease: a
      multicentre randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 327-35
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of an elemental and a polymeric diet as
      the primary therapy for active Crohn's disease in children. METHODS: In a
      randomized, non-blind, multicentre, controlled trial in Sweden, 16 children with 
      Crohn's disease received Elemental 028 Extra (E028E) and 17 Nutrison Standard
      (NuS). Remission rates (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) < 10 or
      a PCDAI decrease of 40% or 15 points of initial level) were compared at 6 wk.
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in remission 
      rate at 6 wk (intent-to-treat analysis): E028E 11/16 (69%) and NuS 14/17 (82%) (p
      = 0.438). There was no difference in the decrease in PCDAI and CDAI between
      patients treated with E028E and those treated with NuS from 0 to 6 wk. Patients
      treated with NuS gained significantly more weight than patients treated with
      E028E (+2.5 kg; 95% CI 0.9, 4.1; p = 0.004), this difference remained when
      adjusting for maximum caloric intake per kilogram bodyweight (+2.9 kg; 95% CI
      1.4, 4.5; p = 0.001). Concomitant disease, complications and side effects were
      seen in 5/33 patients (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess,
      perianal abscess and borborygmi). CONCLUSION: E028E and NuS did not differ in
      terms of remission rate. Patients treated with NuS gained more weight than
      patients with E028E. Polymeric diet may be superior to elemental diet in the
      treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease where the primary aim is to increase the 
      patient's weight.

TI  - Lactobacillus GG in inducing and maintaining remission of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in
      chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
      colitis. Alteration of the intestinal microflora by antibiotic or probiotic
      therapy may induce and maintain remission. The aim of this randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effect of oral Lactobacillus GG (L.
      GG) to induce or maintain medically induced remission. METHODS: Eleven patients
      with moderate to active Crohn's disease were enrolled in this trial to receive
      either L. GG (2 x 10(9) CFU/day) or placebo for six months. All patients were
      started on a tapering steroid regime and received antibiotics for the week before
      the probiotic/placebo medication was initiated. The primary end point was
      sustained remission, defined as freedom from relapse at the 6 months follow-up
      visit. Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI of >100 points. RESULTS: 5/11
      patients finished the study, with 2 patients in each group in sustained
      remission. The median time to relapse was 16 +/- 4 weeks in the L. GG group and
      12 +/- 4.3 weeks in the placebo group (p = 0.5). CONCLUSION: In this study we
      could not demonstrate a benefit of L. GG in inducing or maintaining medically
      induced remission in CD.

TI  - High incidence of anergy in inflammatory bowel disease patients limits the
      usefulness of PPD screening before infliximab therapy.
PG  - 309-13
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reports of tuberculosis (TB) in patients administered
      infliximab prompted the Food and Drug Administration to recommend that all
      patients being considered for this therapy be evaluated for the risk for latent
      TB infection by means of a tuberculin skin test (TST). The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the utility of a TST as an adequate screen for TB exposure in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive
      patients with IBD (Crohn's disease, 70 patients; ulcerative colitis, 4 patients; 
      indeterminate colitis, 8 patients) seen at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IBD Center
      (Los Angeles, CA) being treated with or considered for infliximab therapy
      underwent a standard intradermal purified protein derivative (PPD) TST before or 
      between infusions of infliximab. One or more control antigens (Candida, tetanus, 
      and/or mumps) were concurrently placed on 69 of these patients. Skin tests were
      read for induration at 48-72 hours after placement, and results were recorded.
      RESULTS: None of 82 patients had a positive PPD TST result. Overall, 71% of
      patients (49 of 69 patients) with controls placed failed to react to any antigen.
      Eighty-three percent of patients (40 of 48 patients) who were administered
      corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive medications, not including infliximab,
      for at least 1 month were anergic compared with 43% of patients (9 of 21
      patients; P < 0.002) who were not administered those medications. CONCLUSIONS:
      Given the high prevalence of anergy, a negative TST result in patients with IBD
      administered infliximab is an unreliable indicator for TB exposure. Evaluation
      for TB risks should include not only a TST, but also a detailed history of
      travel, TB exposures, and such symptoms as chronic cough and weight loss, and a
      chest radiograph should be considered.

TI  - Population-based case control study of seroprevalence of Mycobacterium

PG  - 1129-35
AB  - There is renewed enthusiasm for exploring the possibility that Mycobacterium
      paratuberculosis may be causative in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to determine 
      whether CD subjects are more likely to be M. paratuberculosis seropositive than
      controls. Using our population-based University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Research Registry, we recruited CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) subjects
      between 18 and 50 years of age for a study involving detailed questionnaires and 
      venipuncture. We accessed the population-based databases of Manitoba Health
      (single provincial health insurer) to get age-, gender-, and geography-matched
      controls to our inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population. We asked enrolling
      IBD subjects for potential nonaffected sibling controls. We used an enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum antibodies to M. paratuberculosis initially
      developed for cattle but adapted for human use. The rate of positive ELISA
      results, based on previously published interpretation criteria, was significantly
      higher for all study groups. There was no difference in M. paratuberculosis
      seropositivity rate among CD patients (37.8%; n = 283), UC patients (34.7%; n =
      144), healthy controls (33.6%; n = 402), and nonaffected siblings (34.1%; n =
      138). For siblings, there was no correlation between M. paratuberculosis
      serological status and that of the corresponding IBD affected sibling. None of
      the demographic or questionnaire variables studied were predictive of M.
      paratuberculosis status. Subjects with CD and UC were less likely to have
      ingested unpasteurized milk and less likely to have had a non-tap water source as
      a primary water source. In conclusion, in this population-based case control
      study, the M. paratuberculosis seropositivity rate was approximately 35% for all 
      groups and there was no difference in rates between CD patients, UC patients,
      healthy controls, or nonaffected siblings. The much higher rate of seropositivity
      for subjects from Manitoba, Canada, than for those from Denmark or Wisconsin
      cannot be obviously explained. While these data seem to refute any association of
      CD with M. paratuberculosis, the high seroprevalence in Manitobans raises the
      possibility that the high rates of CD in Manitoba could be related to high
      exposure rates for M. paratuberculosis. Hence, the possibility of an association 
      between M. paratuberculosis and CD remains inconclusive.

TI  - Intake of dietary iron is low in patients with Crohn's disease: a case-control
      study.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often experience Fe deficiency (ID) and
      frequently alter their diet to relieve abdominal symptoms. The present study set 
      out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe
      intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients
      with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe
      and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food
      diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a
      recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer
      patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients 
      v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by
      2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with
      controls (both P<0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD
      patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. 
      In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects
      for men (P<0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic
      acid (P<0.001) and phytic acid (P<0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were
      lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted
      percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients
      with CD due to lower intakes (P<0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients,
      which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary
      advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe
      supplementation should be carefully considered.

TI  - Probiotics in gastroenterology: indications and future perspectives.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the
      intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several
      gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been
      disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated
      with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii.
      Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits
      have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea.
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized 
      by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which
      probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and 
      Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce
      relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses
      has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies
      probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for
      probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are
      inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption.
      Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of
      colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this
      disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been
      reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled
      studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use
      can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and
      duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available
      probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be
      elucidated.

      in patients with intestinal resections.
PG  - 985-8
AB  - Specially processed cereals (SPC) can increase antisecretory factor (AF) activity
      in humans with an intact intestine. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate whether AF synthesis could be induced in patients who had been
      subjected to intestinal resections. Eight patients with varying extents of
      intestinal resections due to Crohn's disease and six healthy controls
      participated. All subjects received 54 g SPC daily for 2 weeks. Plasma AF
      activity was determined before, during and after the treatment period. Baseline
      diet and medications were kept unchanged. The patients registered the daily
      number of bowel movements. The SPC diet increased AF activity in all controls. In
      the patients there was a significant correlation between the length of the
      remaining small intestine and AF induction (r=0.94, p<0.01) and only those
      patients with a remaining small intestine of about 3 m reached AF values
      comparable to those in healthy subjects. It is concluded that small bowel length 
      is related to the ability of humans to induce AF activity by dietary means.

TI  - Study of animal-borne infections in the mucosas of patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and population-based controls.
PG  - 4986-90
AB  - Crohn's disease may be triggered by an infection, and it is plausible to consider
      that such an infection may be animal borne and ingested with our food. There has 
      been considerable interest in the past in determining whether Mycobacterium avium
      subsp. paratuberculosis (M. avium) might be the etiologic agent in Crohn's
      disease since it causes a disease in cattle that is similar to Crohn's disease in
      humans. We aimed to determine if there was an association between Crohn's disease
      and infection with M. avium or other zoonotic agents and compared the findings
      with those for patients with ulcerative colitis, unaffected siblings of Crohn's
      disease patients, or population-based controls without inflammatory bowel
      disease. Patients under age 50 years with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, 
      unaffected siblings of patients, or healthy controls drawn from a
      population-based age- and gender-matched registry were enrolled in a study in
      which subjects submitted to a questionnaire survey and venipuncture. A nested
      cohort underwent colonoscopy plus biopsy. Samples were batched and submitted to
      PCR for the detection of M. avium and other zoonotic agents known to cause
      predominately intestinal disease in cattle, sheep, or swine. Only one patient
      with ulcerative colitis, no patients with Crohn's disease, and none of the
      sibling controls were positive for M. avium, whereas 6 of 19 healthy controls
      were positive for M. avium. Since the control subjects were significantly older
      than the case patients, we studied another 11 patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease who were older than age 50 years, and another single subject with
      ulcerative colitis was positive for M. avium. One other subject older than age 50
      years with ulcerative colitis was positive for circovirus, a swine-borne agent of
      infection. In conclusion, by performing PCR with mucosal samples from patients
      with Crohn's disease and controls, no association between Crohn's disease and
      infection with M. avium or any of the other six zoonotic agents studied could be 
      found.

TI  - Rationale for probiotic and antibiotic treatment strategies in inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 105-28
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), commonly referred to as Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis are chronic aggressive disorders which share many similarities
      concerning pathomechanism and clinical course, but have very distinct features.
      Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations,
      such as the terminal ileum and cecum in Crohn's disease and the rectum in
      ulcerative colitis. In recent years, overwhelming evidence accumulated,
      supporting the hypothesis that IBD are characterized by a genetically determined,
      overly aggressive immune response towards ubiquitous luminal antigens, especially
      commensal bacteria and their products. Trials in both human IBD and experimental 
      colitis have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotics may influence the
      course of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and antibiotics with narrow
      activity against the anaerobic fraction of the flora can prevent relapse in
      Crohn's disease after surgically induced remission. Since relevant antibiotic
      strategies can be associated with some side effects, the ongoing research
      recently focused on alternative methods to modify the intestinal flora in
      patients with IBD. Clinical observations including few controlled trials, basic
      research, and animal studies have suggested a potential role for probiotic
      bacteria within the treatment regimens for IBD. However, the mode of action of
      these organisms is still largely unclear and in vitro studies are inconclusive.
      This review summarizes recent in vitro and in vivo data regarding the role of the
      intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and 
      possible therapeutic mechanisms of probiotic bacteria relevant to IBD.
      Furthermore, we will review clinical trials examining the efficacy of antibiotic 
      and probiotic treatment strategies in IBD.

TI  - Sugar intake, taste changes and dental health in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 252-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increased intake of sucrose has been reported in patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD). Since subclinical zinc deficiency reduces taste perception 
      for sweet, we investigated taste perception, sucrose intake and plasma zinc
      levels as well as dental status in CD patients. METHODS: Carbohydrate intake and 
      plasma zinc levels were assessed in 24 CD patients and 24 age-matched controls
      (Con). Taste threshold for sucrose, oral hygiene and caries prevalence were
      evaluated. RESULTS: In CD a higher sucrose intake (CD 107.1 +/- 27.7 vs. Con 71.9
      +/- 13.7 g/day; p < 0.001), a higher taste threshold for sweet (CD 7.31 vs. Con
      2.91 g/l; p < 0.001) and lower plasma zinc levels (CD 11.5 +/- 1.5 vs. Con 13.5
      +/- 2.0 micromol/l; p < 0.001) were found. API was poor (CD 85.4 +/- 23.6, Con
      31.8 +/- 24.1, p < 0.001) and correlated with sucrose intake (p < 0.01). Caries
      prevalence was increased in patients with longer disease (>3 years) (DMFT index: 
      >3 years 15.6 +/- 5.7 vs. <3 years 9.5 +/- 4.3; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dental
      status in CD patients is poor. Both increased sugar consumption and insufficient 
      oral hygiene seem to cause the higher caries prevalence. Obviously, patients with
      CD belong to a high-risk group, and preventive measures should be taken early in 
      the course of the disease.

PG  - 1017-32
AB  - Biological therapies in inflammatory bowel disease reflect the exponential
      advancement in understanding the human intestinal immune system and particularly 
      the biology of intestinal inflammation during the past decade. The better
      understanding of the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease has evolved from
      desriptive clinical data and genetically engineered animal models. It led to
      great interest in the evaluation of a variety of new therapeutic agents with
      novel actions. This review will discuss the mechanisms of biologicals (antibodies
      against pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell antibodies, anti-inflammtory
      cytokines, adhesion molecule blockers, growth factors, hormones, colony
      stimulating factors, fusion proteins, anti-sense oligonucleotides, trefoil
      peptides, immunostimulatory [ISS] DNA) used in the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease and summarizes the available data on established biologic therapies
      as well as investigational agents and briefly touch on probiotics. Based on the
      data discussed, it seems that biologicals will play an important role in managing
      inflammatory bowel disease in the near future.

PG  - 821-31
AB  - Probiotics are living micro-organisms that belong to the normal enteric flora and
      exert a beneficial effect on health and well-being. The rationale for the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in pouchitis (the most frequent long-term
      complication following pouch surgery for ulcerative colitis) and postoperative
      recurrence in Crohn's disease is based on convincing evidence suggesting a
      crucial role for the endogenous intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of
      these conditions. Positive results have been obtained with the administration of 
      highly concentrated probiotic preparations in preventing the onset and relapses
      of pouchitis. Further controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of 
      probiotics in the prophylaxis of postoperative recurrences of Crohn's disease and
      in the treatment of mild pouchitis.

TI  - Probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: a critical review.
PG  - 805-20
AB  - Intestinal bacteria play a key role in inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics
      attempt to modify disease by favourably altering bacterial composition, immune
      status, and inflammation. Until recently, probiotic therapy was considered 'folk'
      medicine, but there now is emerging interest on the part of the general public
      and scientific communities in the use of probiotics in human disease. This
      practical, evidence-based review examines probiotics as therapy for inflammatory 
      bowel disease in humans. There are very few such published randomized clinical
      trials, but some data exist that possibly show an efficacy of probiotics as
      maintenance therapy in chronic relapsing pouchitis. Obstacles to providing
      probiotic therapy include selection of appropriate strains, poorly regulated
      probiotic quality standardization, processing and human biologic factors which
      impair probiotic viability, difficulty in maintaining new bacterial populations
      in the gut, and local product unavailability. Studies have focused on specific
      inflammatory bowel disease subgroups, limiting general applicability for the
      practitioner. Basic research highlights the importance of bacteria in these
      conditions, and the possibility that probiotics will modify physiological
      parameters. Well-designed, randomized clinical studies are still required to
      define the role of probiotics as therapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      the mechanism of their action is described. The possibilities of the therapeutic 
      use of probiotics, in particular for cases of Crohn's disease, viral
      gastroenteritis and travelers' diarrhea are discussed. The conclusion is made
      that the effectiveness of the use of probiotics has not yet been proved due to
      the fact that in clinical trials of these preparations many uncontrolled
      variables are not taken into consideration. For this reason at the present moment
      the prophylactic and curative use of probiotics is an idea whose constructive
      character has yet to be proved.

PG  - 6-9
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a feared and potentially life-threatening
      complication of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis. Currently, the main 
      preventive strategy is a secondary one, i.e. surveillance colonoscopy usually
      after 8 years of disease duration, when the risk for neoplasia begins to
      increase. Despite its widespread acceptance, dysplasia and cancer surveillance is
      unproven in terms of reducing mortality or morbidity and there is a remarkable
      lack of uniformity in the manner in which it is practised. In this review
      article, the pitfalls of dysplasia surveillance are summarized and the need for
      novel chemopreventive and perhaps pharmabiotic approaches for prevention are
      highlighted.

TI  - Probiotic lactobacilli: a new perspective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1973-80
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      results from an interaction between susceptibility genes, the host's bacterial
      environment, gut barrier defects, and immunological factors. New management
      approaches have been evolved from advances in our understanding of the
      pathobiology of this common gut disorder In particular, the therapeutic
      manipulation of the bacterial microenvironment in the gut seems to offer an
      innovative tool for the treatment of those patients. Since the gut is a highly
      sensitizing organ that contributes to the systemic immune response, potent
      treatments need to be developed to reduce gut inflammation in this disorder.
      Recent studies have demonstrated that probiotic lactobacilli, and also
      immunostimulatory DNA sequences from those same bacteria have an important
      anti-inflammatory potential in this context. Future research should better define
      among patients with inflammatory bowel disease the various clinical phenotypes
      with the greatest potential of response to probiotic treatment. Identification of
      the genes leading to the disease and a rather better understanding of the
      underlying immunoregulatory abnormalities will be crucial steps to define the
      different profiles of interaction between endogenous digestive bacterial flora
      and the immune system in each individual patient. Such advances will probably
      lead to targeting of effective treatments, including bacteriotherapy with
      probiotic lactobacilli, to subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 on adhesion to
      and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by adherent-invasive E. coli strains 
      isolated from patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 45-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenic adherent-invasive Escherichia coli have been isolated from
      ileal lesions of Crohn's disease. AIM: : To investigate the non-pathogenic E.
      coli strain Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor) as possible maintenance therapy in
      inflammatory bowel disease by testing its ability to prevent adherent-invasive E.
      coli strains from adhering to and invading human intestinal epithelial cells in
      vitro. METHODS: Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells
      (Intestine-407) were assessed by counting the colony-forming units. The
      inhibitory effect of E. coli Nissle 1917 was determined after co-incubation with 
      adherent-invasive E. coli strains or after pre-incubation of the intestinal
      epithelial cells with this probiotic strain prior to infection with
      adherent-invasive E. coli strains. RESULTS: Strain Nissle 1917 exhibited dose-
      and time-dependent adherence to intestinal epithelial cells and inhibited the
      adhesion and invasion of various adherent-invasive E. coli strains. In
      co-infection experiments, the inhibitory effect on adherent-invasive E. coli
      adhesion reached 78-99.9%. Pre-incubation of intestinal epithelial cells with
      strain Nissle 1917 reduced adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion by 97.2-99.9%. The 
      inhibitory effect on adherent-invasive E. coli invasion paralleled that on
      adhesion. CONCLUSION: As strong and significant inhibitory effects on
      adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion and invasion were observed in co-infection and
      pre-infection experiments, E. coli Nissle 1917 could be efficient for preventive 
      or curative probiotic therapy in patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - CBP 1011: Colirest, Hematrol.
PG  - 241-2
AB  - InKine Pharmaceutical Co. is developing an oral compound, CBP 1011, for the
      treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [Hematrol] and for the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      (Colirest). This profile has been selected from R&D Insight, a pharmaceutical
      intelligence database produced by Adis International Ltd. CBP 1011 or
      medroxyprogesterone, is a progesterone agonist and inhibits pro-inflammatory
      mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). CBP 1011 was
      originally developed by CorBec Pharmaceuticals, which in 1997 was aquired by
      Panax and then intergrated into InKine Pharmaceuticals. According to a company
      spokesperson, InKline is pursuing outlicensing opportunities for Hematrol since
      the company's current commercial focus is on gastrointestinal products. In June
      2000, InKine announced the completion of a study comparing the bioavailability of
      a commercially viable tablet formulation of CBP 1011 to the original capsule
      formulation that is currently being used in the company's phase III studies in
      patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Preliminary results from this 
      study indicate that the bioavailability of the tablet formulation does not differ
      significantly from that of the capsule formulation. The trial enrolled ITP
      patients (i) who are HIV positive, (ii) who are chronic ITP sufferers despite
      having had a splenectomy, (iii) who are older, or (iv) who have less severe
      thrombocytopenia. In preclinical trials, CBP 1011 was shown to decrease
      lymphocyte infiltration into the bowel compared with the control. Studies also
      show that it possibly offers safety benefits over steroid therapies. In June
      2001, InKine commenced enrolment for a pivotal phase III trial in the treatment
      of Crohn's disease. This randomised, double-blind trial will enrol approximately 
      250 patients and will compare two doses of CBP 1011 (400 and 1000mg) with
      placebo. In April 2003, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted InKine
      Pharmaceutical a 'Notice of Allowance' for the 'Method of Treating Inflammatory
      Conditions with Progesterone or Progesterone Analogs'. This patent for
      medroxyprogesterone (Colirest) provides InKine patent protection for the use of
      Colirest in treating patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
      proctitis, microscopic colitis, allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, food
      allergies, drug-induced oesophagitis, coeliac disease, recurrent polyps and
      haemorrhoids. The patent protection also covers Colirest in a variety of delivery
      forms such as tablet, enema, suppository, foam, gel, ointment and suspension.

TI  - Crohn's disease: a defensin deficiency syndrome?
PG  - 627-34
AB  - This comprehensive review promotes the novel concept that a defensin deficiency, 
      i.e. lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics, may play a pivotal role in the
      aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Such an impaired function of this chemical 
      barrier is consistent with the epidemiological relationship of good domestic
      hygiene with the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. The disregulated
      adaptive immune system, formerly believed to be the major cause in the
      development of Crohn's disease, may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal
      defence since the immune response is mostly directed against lumenal bacteria.
      Recent work has identified five different defensins expressed in colonic mucosa. 
      In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease is characterised by an
      impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. This deficient induction may 
      be due to changes in the intracellular transcription by NFkappaB and the
      intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2, mutated in Crohn's disease. These
      findings are consistent with the mucosal attachment of lumenal bacteria in
      inflammatory bowel diseases and the frequent occurrence of other infectious
      agents. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also
      consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain
      inflammatory bowel disease states.

TI  - Probiotics: a perspective on problems and pitfalls.
PG  - 34-6
AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut flora with probiotics promises to be a useful
      strategy for several disorders, including infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic
      conditions. However, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the normal flora
      and of the optimal use of probiotic products. At present, there is no reliable in
      vitro predictor of in vivo efficacy of putative probiotics. Indeed, probiotic
      performance should be defined in the context of the disease indication for which 
      it is intended. This will require rigorous prospective clinical trials. In
      addition, guidelines for routine clinical use of probiotics are confounded by
      insufficient data on optimum strain selection, dose, delivery vehicle and
      monitoring. Before the promise can be fulfilled, problems and potential pitfalls 
      with probiotic therapy need resolution.

TI  - Ferrous fumarate deteriorated plasma antioxidant status in patients with Crohn
      disease.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anaemia is a frequent complication of Crohn disease. 
      Treatment with ferrous iron (Fe2-) compounds is often unsatisfactory and is
      associated with gastrointestinal side effects. Theoretically, oral iron
      supplementation may even be harmful, because iron may reinforce intestinal
      inflammation by catalysing production of reactive oxygen species. We investigated
      the effect of ferrous iron on disease activity and plasma antioxidant status in
      patients with active Crohn disease. METHODS: Ten patients with Crohn disease and 
      iron deficiency and 10 healthy controls were given ferrous fumarate 120 mg for 7 
      days. The Crohn Disease Activity Index, gastrointestinal complaints and blood
      samples for antioxidant status, anaemia, inflammation and iron absorption were
      investigated on day 1 and day 8. RESULTS: During 1 week of ferrous fumarate
      supplementation, the Crohn Disease Activity Index tended to increase (P = 0.071).
      Patients experienced aggravation of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea.
      Plasma-reduced cysteine was lower (P = 0.038) in patients than it was in
      controls. One week of ferrous iron supplementation further decreased reduced
      cysteine (P < 0.001) and significantly decreased plasma-reduced glutathione (P = 
      0.004) in the patients. Serum iron increased significantly in patients after an
      oral iron load test (from 5.8 +/- 3.2 micromol/L to 30.9 +/- 13.1 micromol/L).
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of iron deficiency with ferrous fumarate deteriorated
      plasma antioxidant status and increased specific clinical symptoms in patients
      with active Crohn disease. Plasma reduced cysteine may be a sensitive indicator
      for oxidative stress in the intestine.

PG  - 38-42
AB  - After first resection in Crohn's disease at 1 year 60-80% of patients have
      endoscopic recurrence, 10-20% have clinical relapse, and 5% have surgical
      recurrence.1, 2 This review focuses on the actual evidence on the prevention of
      recurrence and relapse dealing with risk factors and with drugs. Smoking is the
      only risk factor for Crohn's disease, that has been shown to be related to both
      endoscopic and surgical recurrence and relapse. Among the different drugs
      evaluated, some (Mesalamine and Metronidazole) have been shown to be effective,
      whereas others (immunosuppressive) need to be evaluated in further, new trials.

TI  - Case reports of heart failure after therapy with a tumor necrosis factor
      antagonist.
PG  - 807-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Etanercept and infliximab are U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration-approved tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. OBJECTIVE: To
      describe adverse event reports of heart failure after TNF antagonist therapy.
      DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch
      program. PATIENTS: 47 patients who developed new or worsening heart failure
      during TNF antagonist therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory reports.
      RESULTS: After TNF antagonist therapy, 38 patients developed new-onset heart
      failure and 9 patients experienced heart failure exacerbation. Of the 38 patients
      with new-onset heart failure, 19 (50%) had no identifiable risk factors. Ten
      patients younger than 50 years of age developed new-onset heart failure after
      receiving TNF antagonists. After TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued and
      heart failure therapy was started in these 10 patients, 3 had complete resolution
      of heart failure, 6 improved, and 1 died. CONCLUSION: In a fraction of patients, 
      TNF antagonists might induce new-onset heart failure or exacerbate existing
      disease.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis: evidence
      for limited strain diversity, strain sharing, and identification of unique
      targets for diagnosis.
PG  - 2015-26
AB  - The objectives of this study were to understand the molecular diversity of animal
      and human strains of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolated in the 
      United States and to identify M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific
      diagnostic molecular markers to aid in disease detection, prevention, and
      control. Multiplex PCR of IS900 integration loci (MPIL) and amplified fragment
      length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses were used to fingerprint M. avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis isolates recovered from animals (n = 203) and patients with
      Crohn's disease (n = 7) from diverse geographic localities. Six hundred bacterial
      cultures, including M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (n = 303), non-M. avium
      subsp. paratuberculosis mycobacteria (n = 129), and other nonmycobacterial
      species (n = 168), were analyzed to evaluate the specificity of two IS900
      integration loci and a newly described M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific 
      sequence (locus 251) as potential targets for the diagnosis of M. avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis. MPIL fingerprint analysis revealed that 78% of bovine origin M.
      avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates clustered together into a major node,
      whereas isolates from human and ovine sources showed greater genetic diversity.
      MPIL analysis also showed that the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates from
      ovine and bovine sources from the same state were more closely associated than
      were isolates from different geographic regions, suggesting that some of the
      strains are shared between these ruminant species. AFLP fingerprinting revealed a
      similar pattern, with most isolates from bovine sources clustering into two major
      nodes, while those recovered from sheep or humans were clustered on distinct
      branches. Overall, this study identified a high degree of genetic similarity
      between M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains recovered from cows regardless
      of geographic origin. Further, the results of our analyses reveal a relatively
      higher degree of genetic heterogeneity among M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis
      isolates recovered from human and ovine sources.

TI  - Selenium deficiency in a patient with Crohn's disease receiving long-term total
      parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - We report a case of selenium deficiency in a patient with Crohn's disease on
      long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She manifested lassitude of the legs,
      discoloration of the nail beds, and macrocytosis. Since her plasma selenium level
      was found to be below the measurable level, we diagnosed this case as selenium
      deficiency. After intravenous administration of sodium selenite, her symptoms
      were reversed. Careful attention should be paid to selenium deficiency when a
      patient receives long-term TPN; supplementary administration of selenium via TPN 
      may be required because selenium is often not routinely added to TPN
      formulations.

TI  - [Allergy-associated colitis. Characterization of an entity and its differential
      diagnoses].
PG  - 28-35
AB  - There is substantial evidence that allergic reactions exist in the
      gastrointestinal tract (GI). However, patients with food allergy-related
      enteropathy pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians because the clinical
      features are variable, unspecific, occur in other gastrointestinal disorders, and
      specific diagnostic tools are missing. Several recent studies and reviews have
      focused on the function of eosinophilic granulocytes in GI disease. The role of
      eosinophils in the pathophysiology of GI hypersensitivity reactions is poorly
      defined. However, some findings have been reported that imply an involvement of
      eosinophils in allergic reactions of the gut. The presumptive histology of
      allergy-associated colitis in colonic and ileal biopsies is based on prominent
      pure eosinophilic infiltration of a normal lamina propria, submucosa and
      epithelium with variable degrees of degranulation. An immunoperoxidase stain for 
      eosinophilic peroxidase is supportive in establishing the diagnosis if suspected.
      Neutrophils or mononuclear infiltrates are not significantly increased and damage
      to the intestinal tissue is not prominent. Despite characteristic histologic
      changes in colonic biopsy specimens, a final diagnosis depends on careful
      clinical examination and exclusion of several differential diagnoses.

TI  - Supplement of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture for Crohn's disease: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 137-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease remains unclear, dietary 
      fat is thought to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. Chitosan is a
      water-insoluble dietary fiber, and a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture has been 
      shown in rats to increase fecal fat excretion without affecting protein
      digestibility. However, it remains unclear whether a chitosan and ascorbic acid
      mixture is safe and effective for patients with Crohn's disease. We designed a
      pilot trial to investigate the tolerability and amount of fat excretion after the
      oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture for inactive Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: Eleven outpatients were given seven tablets daily of a chitosan
      and ascorbic mixture (chitosan was given at 1.05 g/d) for 8 wk. Patients did not 
      interrupt their respective therapies for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: The bowel
      movements of most patients increased slightly during the study. Nutritional and
      inflammatory markers in patients did not differ before and after treatment. The
      chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture significantly increased the fat concentration 
      in the feces during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oral
      administration of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture in patients with Crohn's
      disease is tolerable and increases fecal fat excretion without affecting disease 
      activity.

TI  - New indications for treatment of chronic inflammation by TNF-alpha blockade.
PG  - 75-92
AB  - The impressive anti-inflammatory effects of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha 
      blockers etanercept and infliximab have led to their use in multiple inflammatory
      diseases besides their original indication, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The
      well-studied clinical effects of both agents in RA are the reduction of signs and
      symptoms of joint inflammation as well as the arrest of bone destruction.
      Infliximab has also been Food and Drug Administration-approved in the treatment
      of Crohn disease; etanercept is now FDA-approved for juvenile chronic arthritis
      and psoriatic arthritis. Favorable initial clinical trials have been reported in 
      other rheumatic diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and adult Still
      disease. In addition, TNF alpha blockade is being studied in the treatment of
      uveitis, myelodysplastic syndromes, and graft-versus-host disease. Studies in
      sepsis and septic shock have identified small subsets of patients that may
      benefit from TNF alpha blockade, but broader use in septic patients has not
      improved survival. The TNF alpha blockers have had relatively infrequent serious 
      side effects, especially compared with the immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents
      otherwise employed to treat these diseases. Further studies of optimal dosing,
      combination with other therapies, and long-term benefits and side effects will
      emerge from future trials.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - Dietary fat attenuates the benefits of an elemental diet in active Crohn's
      disease: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although an elemental diet has been established as the primary
      treatment for patients with Crohn's disease, the influence of dietary fat on the 
      elemental diet remains unclear. We have designed the first randomized, controlled
      trial for elemental diets containing different fat percentages in patients with
      active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Each patient was randomized to receive one of
      three dose levels of fat in an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks: 10 patients 
      received low fat (3.06 g/day), 10 patients received medium fat (16.56 g/day) and 
      eight patients received high fat (30.06 g/day). The additional fat was composed
      of long-chain fatty acids. All patients were evaluated using the International
      Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, plus C-reactive protein level 
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were measured at weekly intervals.
      RESULTS: Although the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      rating, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the
      low-fat group decreased, the values in the medium- and high-fat groups fluctuated
      during the study. The remission rate after 4 weeks in each group was 80%, 40% and
      25% for patients in the low-, medium- and high-fat groups, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: When the fat consisted of long-chain triglycerides, a high amount of
      this fat in the elemental diet formula decreased its therapeutic effect against
      active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease: fat in the formula.
PG  - 115-8
AB  - Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease.
      Speculation on the underlying mechanism of action has moved away from the
      presentation of nitrogen and towards the fat content of the various enteral
      feeds. Evidence is accumulating that additional long-chain triglyceride in such
      feeds impairs the response rate in active Crohn's disease, whereas no deleterious
      effects of additional medium-chain triglyceride have been identified. It has been
      proposed that long-chain triglycerides composed from n-6 fatty acids may be the
      most harmful, since such fatty acids are substrates for inflammatory eicosanoid
      production. However, recent studies comparing different enteral feeds are not
      consistent in identifying which additional fatty acids impair response rates to
      the greatest extent. Despite meta-analyses concluding that polymeric diets
      (typically containing large amounts of fat) are as effective as elemental diets, 
      it would seem sensible to use enteral feeds with minimal fat content when
      treating active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Laparoscopic vs conventional ileocolectomy for primary Crohn disease.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Laparoscopic ileocolectomy can reduce the length of hospital stay and
      hospital charges compared with conventional surgery in the treatment of primary
      Crohn disease. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, comparative, retrospective analysis of a
      prospective database. SETTING: University hospital tertiary care center for
      inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS: Forty patients, 20 in the laparoscopic
      group (group A) and 20 in the conventional group (group B). INTERVENTION: From
      July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2001, we collected data on the following demographic
      clinical end points: age, sex, duration of disease, preoperative medical
      treatment, previous abdominal surgery, procedure performed, conversions to open
      surgery, operating time, number of trocars used, size of incision, blood loss,
      time to resolution of ileus, time to starting solid food diet, duration of
      hospital stay, hospital charges, morbidity, and mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Surgical results, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and recurrences.
      RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.7 years (range, 20-68 years) in
      group A vs 40.0 years (range, 18-75 years) in group B. The male-female ratio was 
      1:2 in group A vs 1:1 in group B. The morbidity was 5% in group B. There was no
      mortality. Operating time was longer in group A (mean, 145.0 minutes; range,
      45-270 minutes) compared with group B (mean, 133.5 minutes; range, 98-177
      minutes) (P =.36). Blood loss was significantly higher in group B (mean, 265.5
      mL; range, 100-400 mL) compared with group A (77.2 mL; range, 25-350 mL)
      (P<.001). Also, the size of the incision was significantly longer in group B
      (mean, 13.5 cm; range, 8-18 cm) compared with group A (mean, 5.5 cm; range, 3-12 
      cm) (P<.001). Bowel function returned more quickly in the laparoscopic group vs
      the conventional group in terms of return of bowel movements (1.70 vs 2.63 days) 
      (P<.001) and resumption of a regular diet (1.35 vs 2.73 days) (P<.001). The mean 
      length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (4.25 days) vs
      the conventional group (8.25 days) (P<.001). The mean hospital charges were US
      $9614 in group A vs US $17 079 in group B (P<.05). The mean follow-up was 17.2
      months in group A (range, 2.3-59.9 months) vs 18.7 months in group B (range,
      1.0-37.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary
      Crohn disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most
      cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn disease should be considered as the
      preferred operative approach for primary resections.
