TI  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) antigen in obese and normal weight
      subjects.
PG  - 42-7

AB  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its cell wall components have been
      used as one of the alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in the feed
      industry. Antibodies to cell wall mannan of this yeast (ASCA) have been
      traditionally used in the study of Crohn's disease (CD). We applied ASCA in
      relation to obesity. This study aims (i) to determine the concentration of ASCA
      (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in obese compared with normal
      weight individuals and (ii) to determine if there is a correlation between ASCA
      concentrations, obesity indices and C-reactive protein. Forty obese individuals
      (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg m(-2) ) and 18 healthy (BMI < 25 kg m(-2) )
      volunteers participated in this case-control study. Binding activity of serum IgA
      and IgG to the cell wall mannan of S. cerevisiae was measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. More than one-third of the obese individual (35%) showed
      elevated titres of ASCA compared with the control group (5%). This antibody was
      positively associated with weight (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02) and waist
      circumference (P = 0.02), but not with C-reactive protein. It seems that ASCA are
      not only specific for CD but are also associated with obesity. S. cerevisiae or a
      related antigen may play a role in the matrix of this complex condition.

TI  - Probiotics and antibiotics in IBD.
PG  - 10-7
LID - 10.1159/000367820 [doi]
AB  - The involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is supported by 
      many findings and is thus now commonly acknowledged. The imbalance in the
      composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) observed in IBD patients is one of the 
      strongest arguments and provides the rationale for a therapeutic manipulation of 
      the gut microbiota. The tools available to achieve this goal include fecal
      microbiota transplantation, but antibiotics and probiotics have been the most
      used one until now. Although antibiotics have shown some efficacy in inducing
      remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as
      preventing postoperative relapse in CD, they are not currently recommended for
      the treatment of IBD except for septic complications, notably because of
      long-term tolerance and ecological issues. Some probiotics have been shown to be 
      as good as 5-aminosalicylic acid to maintain remission in mild-to-moderate UC,
      but have been disappointing until now in CD in all tested indications. In
      pouchitis, antibiotics and probiotics have shown efficacy for inducing and
      maintaining remission, respectively. Targeting the gut microbiota in IBD is an
      attractive strategy. Current efforts to better understand the host-microbiota
      interactions in physiological as well as disease settings might lead to the
      development of rational-based treatments.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

TI  - The probiotic VSL#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic
      recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not 
      been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We 
      investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic
      species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of
      ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were
      randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria,
      comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain
      of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo
      (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the
      neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine
      analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence 
      at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of
      patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the
      proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ
      significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions 
      of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic
      recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the
      entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90
      through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365)
      were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 
      42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal
      inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's
      disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were
      similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in
      endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and
      patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and
      a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the
      entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for 
      prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence. Clinical trials.gov number:

AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

AB  - Clostridium difficile (CD) infection is increasing in frequency and severity in
      in-hospital and outpatient clinical settings, with a recurrence that can reach
      30% after first episode. The recurrences are usually treated with longer courses 
      of metronidazole or vancomycin. Other treatments have been used, such as
      probiotics, fidaxomicin, rifaximin, immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies
      against toxins A and B. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a
      promising strategy in this group of patients, with effectiveness greater than
      90%. We present the first case reported in Chile of this therapeutic strategy in 
      a patient with Crohn's disease and recurrent CD infection who presented after the
      fecal transplantation an Escherichia coli bacteremia, suggesting the need for
      caution in the use of this strategy. 10 months after the FMT the patient
      presented a new episode of E. coli bacteremia and two episodes of diarrhea due to
      CD infection, treated both of them with vancomycin with good clinical response.

AB  - The way we treat inflammatory bowel disease is rapidly changing. Biologics have
      accounted for the biggest change in recent years, and they are being used on a
      more regular basis, on more indications and at earlier stages. However, primary
      response failure and, above all, secondary response failure and cost represent
      serious limitations for their use. Combination immunosuppressant therapy,
      individualization depending on levels and response, increasing compliance and a
      more suitable choice of cases can all enhance effectiveness. However in many
      cases, new alternatives will be necessary. Recently, 2 new antibodies have been
      approved: golimumab is a new option for ulcerative colitis and with another more 
      selective mechanism of action; vedolizumab could be useful for ulcerative colitis
      as well as Crohn's disease. Ustekinumab is an alternative treatment option for
      refractory Crohn's disease. In addition to biologics, autologous bone marrow
      transplants and, anecdotally, the use of immunoglobulins have been suggested as
      alternatives in some carefully selected cases. Although effective for Clostridium
      difficile infection, the potential role of fecal transplants in inflammatory
      bowel disease is still to be determined, without initially observing very
      promising results. The use of probiotics has not produced significant positive
      results.

TI  - The use of probiotics in IBD and IBS.
PG  - 491-500
AB  - While the role of microflora is well established in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBS); data is still emerging regarding IBS as the
      knowledge on brain-gut interaction grows. For both patient groups multiple
      efficacious treatments exist, but there are still unmet needs as long term
      disease control remains an issue. Given the importance of the microbiome on the
      development of the immune system and the interaction between the microbiome and
      the host organism, this "route" is being examined increasingly as a therapeutic
      possibility in both pathologies with variable results. We here provide a short
      overview on the existing data, meta-analysis and single studies, on probiotic
      treatment in both diseases.

AB  - Important advances during the last decade have been made in understanding the
      complex etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). While many gaps in our
      knowledge still exist, it has been suggested that the etiology of CD is
      multifactorial including genetic, environmental and infectious factors. The most 
      widely accepted theory states that CD is caused by an aggressive immune response 
      to infectious agents in genetically predisposed individuals. The rise of
      genome-wide association studies allowed the identification of loci and genetic
      variants in several components of host innate and adaptive immune responses to
      microorganisms in the gut, highlighting an implication of intestinal microbiota
      in CD etiology. Moreover, numerous independent studies reported a dysbiosis,
      i.e., a modification of intestinal microbiota composition, with an imbalance
      between the abundance of beneficial and harmful bacteria. Although microorganisms
      including viruses, yeasts, fungi and bacteria have been postulated as potential
      CD pathogens, based on epidemiological, clinicopathological, genetic and
      experimental evidence, their precise role in this disease is not clearly defined.
      This review summarizes the current knowledge of the infectious agents associated 
      with an increased risk of developing CD. Therapeutic approaches to modulate the
      intestinal dysbiosis and to target the putative CD-associated pathogens, as well 
      as their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 11505-24
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11505 [doi]
AB  - It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms
      in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis 
      of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence
      supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central
      role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes
      chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of
      probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic 
      strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different
      immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use 
      of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative
      pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for
      maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated
      barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some
      benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in
      remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are
      disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is
      weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with
      medical therapy in maintenance treatment.

TI  - Gut microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease: the role of antibiotics in disease
      management.
PG  - 7-19
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2779 [doi]
AB  - Imbalances in the composition and number of bacteria in the gut microbiota have
      been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and modulation of the gut
      microbiota by probiotics and antibiotics in IBD has been an active area of
      research, with mixed results. This narrative review summarizes the findings of
      relevant publications identified using the PubMed database. Although antibiotics 
      have been associated with an increased risk of IBD development and flares,
      several meta-analyses demonstrate that antibiotics are efficacious for the
      induction of remission and treatment of flares in patients with IBD. Data
      supporting their use include a large number of antibiotic studies in Crohn's
      disease and evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious in both Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis, although there are fewer studies of the latter. For
      Crohn's disease, antibiotics have been shown to be useful for the induction of
      remission and in the postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery.
      Additionally, patients with fistulizing disease, particularly perianal, can
      benefit from antibiotics administered short term. Both antimicrobials and
      probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pouchitis.
      Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the role 
      of bacteria in IBD and to better inform clinicians about appropriate antibiotic
      therapies.

AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries 
      and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune
      system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to 
      relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune
      dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the
      environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota
      or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has
      upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and
      antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western
      countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of 
      diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a
      chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an
      abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has
      been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against
      extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed,
      by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG)
      developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food
      bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera
      collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease
      patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of
      IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei
      subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; 
      n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA
      antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients 
      appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the 
      basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association
      of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food
      and probiotic bacteria.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing disorders leading to
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise aetiology of IBD
      remains unclear, several factors are believed to contribute to disease
      pathogenesis. Among these, the role of the intestinal microbiota has become more 
      and more appreciated. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies strongly
      suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation results from a dysregulated immune 
      response towards components of the microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts.
      The growing perception of the microbiota as a major driver of disease
      pathogenesis raises the question, if the intestinal microbiota can be used as a
      therapeutic target in CD. Based on what we know about host microbiota
      interactions in health and disease, the objective of this review is to address
      the question if the microbiota holds the key to the future therapy in CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain
      topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD
      expands. METHODS: Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed,
      based on recent preclinical and clinical research. RESULTS: A top-down approach
      to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors
      for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt
      the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce
      mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be
      used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined
      through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised
      throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action
      will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to
      another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of
      biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms
      of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and
      requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve
      manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet
      and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is
      also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking. CONCLUSIONS:
      The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an
      outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological
      processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.

AB  - Our understanding of the microbial involvement in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) pathogenesis has increased exponentially over the past decade. The
      development of newer molecular tools for the global assessment of the gut
      microbiome and the identification of nucleotide-binding oligomerization
      domain-containing protein 2 in 2001 and other susceptibility genes for Crohn's
      disease in particular has led to better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of
      IBD. The microbial studies have elaborated the normal composition of the gut
      microbiome and its perturbations in the setting of IBD. This altered microbiome
      or "dysbiosis" is a key player in the protracted course of inflammation in IBD.
      Numerous genome-wide association studies have identified further genes involved
      in gastrointestinal innate immunity (including polymorphisms in genes involved in
      autophagy: ATG16L1 and IGRM), which have helped elucidate the relationship of the
      local innate immunity with the adjacent luminal bacteria. These developments have
      also spurred the search for specific pathogens which may have a role in the
      metamorphosis of the gut microbiome from a symbiotic entity to a putative
      pathogenic one. Here we review advances in our understanding of microbial
      involvement in IBD pathogenesis over the past 10 years and offer insight into how
      this will shape our therapeutic management of the disease in the coming years.

AB  - Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide 
      association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that
      implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More
      recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the
      pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered
      interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced 
      technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host 
      and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a
      large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important
      microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about
      the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent
      progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting
      associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that
      have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by
      metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and
      methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with
      inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Paediatric Crohn's disease is a disorder characterised by a chronic
      inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal
      dysbiosis is a key factor in the multifactorial pathogenesis of this disease.
      Different dietary supplements have been proposed as alternative therapy both on
      induction and on maintaining remission of this disease. OBJECTIVE: To review
      current scientific evidence of intestinal dysbiosis in paediatric Crohn's disease
      patients, as well as efficacy of dietary supplement therapy (especially
      probiotics). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensive search of scientific publications
      was performed in specialized electronic databases: NBCI, Elsevier, Scielo, Scirus
      and Science Direct. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An increase of Proteobacteria and a
      reduction of Firmicutes were observed in Crohn's disease paediatric patients.
      However the results referring to phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria are
      disperse. Referring the use of dietary supplements, the use of probiotics did not
      show any positive impact in paediatric Crohn's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: A
      better knowledge and understanding of the bacterial flora modifications in
      paediatric Crohn's disease patients is possible with the current published
      results. However, it is not possible to define the precise microbiota associated 
      or causing this disease. In addition, current results do not bring solid evidence
      of the efficacy of probiotic therapy in those patients.

AB  - Verhulst's logistic differential equation, popular in mathematical ecology, is
      used in modeling of population growth, neural networks, statistics, reaction
      models, Fermi distribution, modeling of tumor growth, etc. We used this function 
      to characterize growth of commensal Escherichia coli isolates from gut microflora
      in Crohn's disease patients. The results of our investigations show differences
      in growth parameters of commensal E. coli, isolated from the gut microflora in
      Crohn's disease patients and healthy volunteers; it is most likely explained by
      the influence of chronic inflammatory processes on growth and reproduction of
      these bacteria. It has been established that the used mathematical model well
      characterizes growth of patients' gut E. coli isolates, and it can be important
      for the expedient probiotics' application during the disease.

AB  - Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought
      new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota 
      is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it
      interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly,
      at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked
      to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease
      or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently
      in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is
      essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it 
      healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating
      certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be
      very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define
      standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics
      need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they
      induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the
      potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.

TI  - British Dietetic Association evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management
      of Crohn's disease in adults.
PG  - 207-18
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
      Appropriate use of diet and nutritional therapy is integral to the overall
      management strategy of Crohn's disease. The aim was to develop evidence-based
      guidelines on the dietary management of Crohn's disease in adults. METHODS:
      Questions relating to the dietary management of Crohn's disease were developed.
      These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food
      re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission,
      and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or
      prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was
      conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified
      using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE,
      MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations,
      practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS:
      Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the
      basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, 
      enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative
      option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food
      re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help
      maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of
      strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of
      probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an
      alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce
      disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food
      re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to
      reduce variation in clinical practice.

AB  - The diverse and complex community of microorganisms that has co-evolved with the 
      human gut is vital to intestinal functioning, and disturbances in the microbiota 
      and its relationship with the host immune system have been linked to inflammatory
      bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This has
      suggested several treatment options, including antibiotics, probiotics and faecal
      transplantation. The human microbiome project has been established to enable
      comprehensive characterisation of the human microbiota and in the coming years,
      knowledge in this area is expected to continue to expand.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on inducing remission and maintaining therapy in ulcerative 
      colitis, Crohn's disease, and pouchitis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled
      trials.
PG  - 21-35
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437495.30052.be [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in
      inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial. METHODS:
      Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing
      probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related
      to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were 
      also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total
      of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis,
      probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates
      were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than
      placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only
      VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in
      patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P <
      0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for
      maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different
      adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of 
      UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Administration
      of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients
      with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with
      pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic
      acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events
      presented.

AB  - Ample research has described multiple biological activities of probiotics in
      animals and in humans. Probiotics interfere with local and systemic immune
      reactions and thus exert an influence on the barrier function of the intestinal
      mucosa. Therefore, attempting inflammatory bowel disease treatment with
      probiotics seems reasonable. In fact, a growing number of trials have studied the
      therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Promising results 
      have been found and in some, indications such as maintenance of remission of
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis guidelines recommend therapy with probiotics
      already today. However, many open questions still remain and the urgent need for 
      high-quality trials requires much more research in the future.

AB  - The drugs available for inflammatory bowel disease are aminosalicylates,
      antibiotics, steroids, immunosuppressors and biologics. The effectiveness of
      these drugs has been evaluated in many randomized clinical trials, mainly versus 
      placebo. Few studies have been conducted comparing the different drugs among
      themselves, owing to the methodological problems raised by comparative trials,
      such as sample size and blindness. This review focuses mainly on the randomized
      clinical trials that have compared different treatments. Of course comparisons
      are mainly between drugs used in a particular setting (mild, moderate and severe 
      disease). However, on many occasions there is no homogeneity in these clinical
      settings, and therefore the results are difficult to interpret.

AB  - Probiotics are nowadays frequently used by patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease, however literature data are conflicting related to their importance. In 
      mild to moderate ulcerative colitis probiotics can be used effectively in
      induction and maintaining remission, and prevention of pouchitis. As the other
      side of the shield, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of
      probiotics in daily clinical practice in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present 
      review is to provide help for clinicians about the probiotic use in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The comparison of literature data is limited by the
      large number of probiotic strains, various combined preparations, and different
      doses applied in the clinical studies. Small number of comparable protocols and
      lack of standardization encumber the analysis of study results.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of
      colonic microflora in patients with colitis and if this could be altered with one
      month's treatment with synbiotics. METHODS: This was a pilot study in which
      patients were randomised to either receive a synbiotics preparation for a month
      and then "crossed over" to receive a placebo, or alternatively to receive the
      placebo first followed in the second month by synbiotic. Stool samples were
      collected on entry into the study and then at the end of first and second months 
      respectively. Colonic microflora was measured by terminal restriction fragment
      length polymorphism technique. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the
      concentration of individual species. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the
      study of whom 8 had Crohn's colitis and 8 had ulcerative colitis. Their median
      age was 62 (IQR 50-65) years. An average of 22 terminal restriction fragments
      (T-RF's) was identified in each patient. Dice cluster analysis showed that each
      patient had a unique microbial composition which did not change significantly at 
      different time points in the study, irrespective of whether they had probiotics
      or the placebo. Probiotic organisms were identified in stool samples but did not 
      alter overall spectrum of microflora. In this pilot study we were unable to
      identify any specific characteristics related to nature of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that there is no difference in colonic microflora between
      patients with Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis and that the spectrum of bacteria was
      not altered by synbiotic administration.

AB  - The human gut is a unique organ in which hundreds of different microbial species 
      find their habitat and in which different host physiologic functions, such as
      digestion, nutrition, and immunity, coexist. Although all these players were
      studied separately for decades, recently, there has been an explosion of studies 
      demonstrating the essential role for interactions between these components in gut
      function. Furthermore, new systems biology methods provide essential tools to
      study this complex system as a whole and to identify key elements that define the
      crosstalk between the gut microbiota, immunity, and metabolism. This review is
      devoted to several human diseases resulting from the disruption in this
      crosstalk, including immunodeficiency-associated and environmental enteropathies,
      celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity. We describe findings in 
      experimental models of these diseases and in germ-free animals that help us
      understand the mechanisms and test new therapeutic strategies. We also discuss
      current challenges that the field is facing and propose that a new generation of 
      antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics coupled with novel, systems
      biology-driven diagnostics will provide the basis for future personalized
      therapy.

AB  - Surgery is an almost inevitable event in Crohn's disease but is not curative;
      post-operative recurrence follows a sequential and predictable course. Prevention
      of post-operative recurrence in Crohn's disease is therefore a relevant problem
      in the management of the disease. Several drugs have been evaluated to decrease
      the risk of recurrence: these include mesalazine, antibiotics, probiotics,
      budesonide, thiopurines and biologic agents. This review focuses on the
      randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses addressing different drugs and
      strategies for preventing post-operative recurrence in Crohn's disease.

AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still incompletely
      understood. While the development of the immune system and the establishment of
      the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe 
      and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of
      intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria 
      prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course.
      Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on
      the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial
      microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been
      disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An
      overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on
      specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by transmural inflammation that is most
      frequently located in the region of the terminal ileum. Although the
      physiopathological mechanisms of the disease are not yet well defined, the
      unregulated immune response is associated with high production of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS). These elements are associated with complex systems known as
      antioxidant defenses, whose function is ROS regulation, thereby preventing the
      harmful effects of these elements. However, the presence of an imbalance between 
      ROS production and ROS elimination by antioxidants has been widely described and 
      leads to oxidative stress. In this article, we describe the most significant
      findings on oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: a review of the effect of obesity and surgically
      induced weight loss.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular,
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically,
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic yeast that has been
      shown to have beneficial effects on the intestinal epithelial barrier and
      digestive immune system. There is preliminary evidence that S boulardii could be 
      used to treat patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We performed a randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of S boulardii in patients with 
      CD who underwent remission during therapy with steroids or aminosalicylates.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 165 patients who achieved remission 
      after treatment with steroids or salicylates; they were randomly assigned to
      groups given S boulardii (1 g/day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point
      was the percentage of patients in remission at week 52. Time to relapse, Crohn's 
      disease activity index scores, and changes in parameters of inflammation were
      secondary end points. RESULTS: CD relapsed in 80 patients, 38 in the S boulardii 
      group (47.5%) and 42 in the placebo group (53.2%, a nonsignificant difference).
      The median time to relapse did not differ significantly between patients given S 
      boulardii (40.7 weeks) vs placebo (39.0 weeks). There were no significant
      differences between groups in mean Crohn's disease activity index scores or
      erythrocyte sedimentation rates or in median levels of C-reactive protein. In a
      post hoc analysis, nonsmokers given S boulardii were less likely to experience a 
      relapse of CD than nonsmokers given placebo, but this finding requires
      confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the probiotic yeast S boulardii is safe and
      well tolerated, it does not appear to have any beneficial effects for patients
      with CD in remission after steroid or salicylate therapies.

AB  - After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the
      development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and
      the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic
      administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews
      significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases
      based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating
      diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain
      Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 
      5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of
      the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality 
      of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative
      colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of
      probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht
      IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics
      containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of
      preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The
      author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In
      Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased
      in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than
      evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims
      for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence
      on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further
      research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the
      international guidelines.

TI  - The interplay between fiber and the intestinal microbiome in the inflammatory
      response.
PG  - 16-28
LID - 10.3945/an.112.003046 [doi]
AB  - Fiber intake is critical for optimal health. This review covers the
      anti-inflammatory roles of fibers using results from human epidemiological
      observations, clinical trials, and animal studies. Fiber has body weight-related 
      anti-inflammatory activity. With its lower energy density, a diet high in fiber
      has been linked to lower body weight, alleviating obesity-induced chronic
      inflammation evidenced by reduced amounts of inflammatory markers in human and
      animal studies. Body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fiber has
      also been extensively studied in animal models in which the type and amount of
      fiber intake can be closely monitored. Fermentable fructose-, glucose-, and
      galactose-based fibers as well as mixed fibers have shown systemic and local
      intestinal anti-inflammatory activities when plasma inflammatory markers and
      tissue inflammation were examined. Similar anti-inflammatory activities have also
      been demonstrated in some human studies that controlled total fiber intake. The
      anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed 
      as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of
      synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been
      observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies,
      although patients with Crohn's disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake.
      Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight-unrelated
      anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in
      vivo evidence. Fermentable fibers are known to affect the intestinal microbiome. 
      The immunomodulatory role of the intestinal microbiome and/or microbial
      metabolites could contribute to the systemic and local anti-inflammatory
      activities of fibers.

PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

TI  - The gut microbiota elicits a profound metabolic reorientation in the mouse
      jejunal mucosa during conventionalisation.
PG  - 1306-14
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301955 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and 
      nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the
      proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions
      occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is
      important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this
      intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised
      with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial
      colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome,
      histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses
      were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the
      colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day 
      after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the
      basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during
      conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an
      oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue
      transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified 
      tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic
      reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response
      signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin
      sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the
      dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the 
      jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The
      molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the
      declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for
      instance.
