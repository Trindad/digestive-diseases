AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that the intestinal bacterial flora together with
      genetic predisposing factors significantly contribute to the immunopathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as reflected by mucosal immune dysregulation.
      Recently, there has been an increased interest in nutraceutical therapies,
      including probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Other dietary interventions with
      low carbohydrate diet, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glutamine have
      been attempted to downregulate the gut inflammatory response and thereby
      alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. Enteral nutrition has been widely used as
      induction and maintenance therapies in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). In
      this review, a critical assessment of the results of clinical trial outcomes and 
      meta-analyses was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dietary and enteral
      interventions for CD.

TI  - Does Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy trigger or protect against Crohn's
      disease?
PG  - 349-354
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is involved in multiple
      gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal disorders. This review focuses on
      possible link between H. pylori eradication and Crohn's disease (CD) which is a
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal calprotectin and; to lesser
      extent; fecal lactoferrin are sensitive and specific markers for monitoring CD
      activity. Data about link between H. pylori eradication and CD are limited and
      inconclusive. The infection likely shifts equilibrium between T helper 1 (Th1)
      and Th2 immune responses to the Th2 pattern. In subjects genetically predisposed 
      to CD (a Th1-related disease), H. pylori eradication increases Th1
      proinflammatory cytokines causing development of CD. In contrast, clarithromycin 
      and/or proton pump inhibitors that are used to eradicate H. pylori can suppress
      Th1 factors, and theoretically can protect against CD, but there are no data to
      support this supposition. This Th1/Th2 approach seems very simplistic. Another
      theory is that alterations in gut microbiota form "continuous antigenic
      stimulation" predisposing to IBD. H. pylori infection can inhibit such
      stimulation through activation of regulatory T cells, and thus eradication may
      predispose to CD. Probiotics weren't found useful in treatment of CD. The
      reported data about link between H. pylori eradication and CD are currently
      limited. Case reports, suggesting a positive association between both conditions,
      provide a very little evidence. On eradicating H. pylori in CD patients and/or
      patients with high risk for CD, patient counseling and follow-up in addition to
      measuring fecal calprotectin may help monitor CD activity. (Acta gastro-enterol.

TI  - Should Immunomodulation Therapy Alter the Surgical Management in Patients With
      Rectovaginal Fistula and Crohn's Disease?
PG  - 670-6
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000000614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rectovaginal fistula in Crohn's disease is challenging for both
      healthcare providers and patients. The impact of immunomodulation therapy on
      healing after surgery is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to
      examine whether immunomodulation therapy impacts healing after surgery for
      rectovaginal fistula in Crohn's disease. DESIGN: This was a retrospective
      analysis with a follow-up telephone survey. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at 
      two major tertiary referral centers. PATIENTS: All of the patients who underwent 
      rectovaginal fistula repair from 1997 to 2013 at our centers were included. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: A chi test and logistical regression analysis were used to
      study treatment outcomes according to type of procedure, recent use of
      immunosuppressives, and number of previous attempted repairs. Age, BMI, smoking, 
      comorbidities, previous vaginal delivery/obstetric injury, use of probiotics,
      diverting stoma, and use of seton were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 120
      (62%) patients were contacted, and 99 (51%) of them agreed to participate in the 
      study. Mean follow-up after surgical repair was 39 months. Procedures included
      advancement flap (n = 59), transvaginal repair (n = 14), muscle interposition (n 
      = 14), episioproctotomy (n = 6), sphincteroplasty (n = 3), and other (n = 3);
      overall, 63% of patients experienced healing. Sixty-eight patients underwent
      recent immunomodulation therapy but did not exhibit statistical significance in
      outcome after surgical repair. In the subset of patients with fistula related to 
      obstetric injury, a 74% (n = 26) healing rate after surgical repair was observed.
      Age, BMI, diabetes mellitus, use of steroids, probiotics, seton before repair,
      fecal diversion, and number of repairs did not affect healing. LIMITATIONS: This 
      was a retrospective analysis; the high volume tertiary referral inflammatory
      bowel disease centers studied may not be reflective of rectovaginal fistula
      presentation, treatment, or results in all patients, and the 3-year follow-up may
      not be sufficiently long. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively low success rate
      (63%) in healing after surgical repair of a rectovaginal fistula, the recent use 
      of immunomodulation therapy did not negatively impact healing. However, tissue
      interposition techniques had the highest success rates.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are
      debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and
      prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal
      permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be
      caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of
      them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the
      influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional
      foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some
      hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will
      soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to
      make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.

AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota has proven valuable in the management 
      of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. Despite some similarities among the various 
      inflammatory bowel conditions, the probiotics investigated thus far seem to
      confer little benefit in Crohn's disease. In this review, we aim to bring
      together the evidence available on the clinical effect of probiotics and
      prebioltics in Crohn's disease patients, and to clarify the place of probiotic
      treatment in current Crohn's therapeutic regimens.

TI  - Characterisation and therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiome in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 266-73
LID - 10.1111/imj.13003 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation
      of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the
      immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised
      the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease 
      based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are
      characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and
      anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data 
      suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional
      activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and
      disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota
      using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal
      microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. 
      However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve 
      therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and
      function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent
      studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and
      to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut
      microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies
      underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and
      metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests 
      that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, 
      drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an
      adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early
      gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies
      using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have 
      yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use 
      is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric 
      disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in
      most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are
      anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut 
      microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for
      improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential to Modify the Mucus Barrier in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu8010044 [doi]
LID - E44 [pii]
AB  - Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays 
      an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly
      in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by
      published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ
      hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus
      barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria.
      Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may
      provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, 
      prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We 
      also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the
      disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with
      short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S,
      neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.

AB  - Since the first publication on "regional ileitis", the relevance of this chronic 
      inflammatory disease condition termed finally as Crohn's disease is continuously 
      increasing. Although we are beginning to comprehend certain aspects of its
      pathogenesis, many facets remain unexplored. Host's gut microbiota is involved in
      a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including immune system 
      development, and pathogen regulation. Further, the microbiome is thought to play 
      a key role in Crohn's disease. The presence of Crohn's-associated variants of
      NOD2 and ATG16L genes appears to be associated not only with alterations of
      mucosal barrier functions, and bacterial killing, but the gut microbiota, as
      well, reflecting a potential relationship between the host's genotype and
      intestinal dysbiosis, involved in disease etiology. This review aims to
      characterize some exciting new aspect of Crohn's disease pathology, focusing
      mainly on the role of intestinal microbes, and their interplay with the immune
      system of the host.

TI  - Dietary Supplement Therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Crohn's Disease and 
      Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 180-8
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are chronic relapsing and remitting chronic diseases for which there is no cure. 
      The treatment of IBD frequently requires immunosuppressive and biologic therapies
      which carry an increased risk of infections and possible malignancy. There is a
      continued search for safer and more natural therapies in the treatment of IBD.
      This review aims to summarize the most current literature on the use of dietary
      supplements for the treatment of IBD. Specifically, the efficacy and adverse
      effects of vitamin D, fish oil, probiotics, prebiotics, curcumin, Boswellia
      serrata, aloe vera and cannabis sativa are reviewed.

AB  - The alterations in the gut microbiota observed in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and in particular in Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis
      patients with pouchitis, provide the rationale for administering probiotic agents
      in the medical treatment of those conditions. In the maintenance treatment of
      inactive Crohn's disease probiotics, when administered alone, were found
      ineffective in preventing clinical and/or endoscopic recurrence. By contrast, a
      combination of a probiotic agent (eg, Saccharomyces boulardii) with standard
      pharmacological therapy can promote clinical benefit. In patients with pouchitis,
      so far only the probiotic mixture VSL #3 proved to effectively prevent relapses
      after successful antibiotic treatment of active inflammation. Further controlled 
      studies, enrolling higher numbers of patients, are needed to better identify the 
      exact role of probiotics in this area.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

TI  - Fragments of Citrullinated and MMP-degraded Vimentin and MMP-degraded Type III
      Collagen Are Novel Serological Biomarkers to Differentiate Crohn's Disease from
      Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 863-72
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is chronic
      inflammation, which leads to excessive extracellular matrix [ECM] remodelling and
      release of specific protein fragments, called neoepitopes. We speculated that the
      biomarker profile panel for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]
      represent a heterogeneous expression pattern, and may be applied as a tool to aid
      in the differentiation between UC and CD. METHODS: Serum biomarkers of degraded
      collagens I, III-IV [C1M, C3M, and C4M], collagen type 1 and IV formation [P1NP, 
      P4NP], and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin [VICM] were studied with a
      competitive ELISA assay system in a cohort including 164 subjects [CD n = 72, UC 
      n = 60, and non-IBD controls n = 32] and a validation cohort of 61 subjects [CD n
      = 46, and UC n = 15]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and
      logistic regression modelling were carried out to evaluate the discriminative
      power of the biomarkers. RESULTS: All biomarkers were corrected for confounding
      factors. VICM and C3M demonstrated the highest diagnostic power, alone, to
      differentiate CD from UC with an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.77 and 0.69,
      respectively. Furthermore, the biomarkers C1M [AUC = 0.81], C3M [AUC = 0.83],
      VICM [AUC = 0.83], and P1NP [AUC = 0.77] were best to differentiate UC from
      non-IBD. The best combinations of biomarkers to differentiate CD from UC and UC
      from non-IBD were VICM, C3M, C4M [AUC = 0.90] and VICM, C3M [AUC = 0.98]
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Specific extracellular matrix degradation markers are 
      elevated in IBD and can discriminate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD controls with
      a high diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - The Roles of Inflammation, Nutrient Availability and the Commensal Microbiota in 
      Enteric Pathogen Infection.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.MBP-0008-2014 [doi]
AB  - The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to
      more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed
      diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members
      engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several
      layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the
      field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our
      understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes
      that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of
      human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2
      diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered
      microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the
      composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over 
      time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by
      environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A
      general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in
      the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed
      colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be
      transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high
      levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes 
      in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of
      diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or
      increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion
      is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease.
      Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial
      families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
      Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio
      cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members
      of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of
      the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic
      trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy,
      dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota
      not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic
      immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over
      microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the
      microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out,"
      respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is
      particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The
      symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an
      excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is
      assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic
      predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier
      function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an
      abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed 
      (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance
      of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at
      the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes
      Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or
      a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are
      equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in
      the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way
      that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current
      state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut
      inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections
      and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric
      pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic
      microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of
      pathogenicity.

TI  - Glucose breath test and Crohn's disease: Diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial

PG  - 1376-81

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by an
      abnormal proliferation of bacterial species in the small bowel. It has been shown
      that patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a higher risk of SIBO development.
      The aim of the present study was to investigate SIBO prevalence in CD patients,
      possible clinical predictors of SIBO development and response to antibiotic
      therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients (42 male, 26 female; mean age
      49.3 +/- 12.8 years) with CD reporting abdominal complaints were prospectively
      evaluated for SIBO with H2/CH4 glucose breath test (GBT). RESULTS: Of the 68
      patients enrolled, 18 (26.5%) tested positive for SIBO. Patients with SIBO
      exhibited increased stool frequency and significant reduction of stool solidity
      (p = 0.014), were older than patients tested negative to GBT (54.3 +/- 13.0 years
      vs. 47.5 +/- 12.3 years, p = 0.049), reported a longer history of CD (21.2 +/-
      10.3 years vs. 15.7 +/- 10.2 years, p = 0.031) and showed a significant higher
      frequency of prior surgery (p = 0.001), revealing an association of number of
      surgical procedures (OR = 2.8315, 95% CI = 1.1525-6.9569, p = 0.023) with SIBO.
      Breath test normalization occurred in 13/15 patients evaluated after antibiotic
      and probiotic therapy. Although vitamin B12 levels were lower in patients with
      SIBO (p = 0.045) and a significant improvement was found after treatment (p =
      0.011), this could be due to the heterogeneity, regarding vitamin B12 treatment, 
      in our cohort. CONCLUSION: SIBO is a frequent but underestimated condition in CD,
      which often mimics acute flare, effectively identified with GBT and could be
      treated with a combined antibiotic and probiotic therapy.

TI  - Can inflammatory bowel disease be permanently treated with short-term
      interventions on the microbiome?
PG  - 781-95
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2015.1013031 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by
      an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease
      remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal
      microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut
      microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both
      prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its
      growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that
      the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term
      interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic
      agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which
      then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on
      these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through
      short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient
      effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic
      options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota
      transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the
      alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.

      subjects.
PG  - 42-7

AB  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its cell wall components have been
      used as one of the alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in the feed
      industry. Antibodies to cell wall mannan of this yeast (ASCA) have been
      traditionally used in the study of Crohn's disease (CD). We applied ASCA in
      relation to obesity. This study aims (i) to determine the concentration of ASCA
      (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in obese compared with normal
      weight individuals and (ii) to determine if there is a correlation between ASCA
      concentrations, obesity indices and C-reactive protein. Forty obese individuals
      (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg m(-2) ) and 18 healthy (BMI < 25 kg m(-2) )
      volunteers participated in this case-control study. Binding activity of serum IgA
      and IgG to the cell wall mannan of S. cerevisiae was measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. More than one-third of the obese individual (35%) showed
      elevated titres of ASCA compared with the control group (5%). This antibody was
      positively associated with weight (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02) and waist
      circumference (P = 0.02), but not with C-reactive protein. It seems that ASCA are
      not only specific for CD but are also associated with obesity. S. cerevisiae or a
      related antigen may play a role in the matrix of this complex condition.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

TI  - The probiotic VSL#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic
      recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not 
      been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We 
      investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic
      species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of
      ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were
      randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria,
      comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain
      of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo
      (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the
      neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine
      analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence 
      at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of
      patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the
      proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ
      significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions 
      of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic
      recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the
      entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90
      through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365)
      were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 
      42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal
      inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's
      disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were
      similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in
      endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and
      patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and
      a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the
      entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for 
      prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence. Clinical trials.gov number:

      disease in children.

LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0067 [doi]
AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.
