TI  - [Enteral alimentation at home: why PEG now?].
PG  - 232-44
AB  - The history of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is relatively short. In 
      1980, a report entitled "Gastrostomy without laparotomy: A percutaneous
      endoscopic technique" by Ponsky and Gaudere was first published in the Journal of
      Pediatric Surgery. Thereafter, PEG soon saw widespread use in Western countries
      because of its clinical efficacy and economy. It has been performed in about
      170,000 cases annually in the US. In contrast, its spread in Japan has been
      extremely slow: only about 10,000 cases have undergone this procedure annually,
      and this number accounted for less than 5% of patients receiving enteral
      alimentation. The reason why PEG has not spread may be the medical insurance
      system in Japan and the local distaste for operation scarring. However, in
      consideration of the unprecedented ageing of society that is surely coming in the
      near future, the role of PEG in Japan must be reexamined. In this report, we
      presented the methodology of enteral alimentation at home by means of PEG, giving
      special consideration to: (1) "What points are improved by using enteral
      alimentation at home by means of PEG in various diseases; (2) dysphagia due to
      cerebral angiopathy; (3) terminal cancer; (4) otolaryngological diseases; and (5)
      Crohn disease. We also discussed "Why PEG is important now?" in performing
      enteral alimentation at home.

TI  - Effect of low- and high-fat, peptide-based diets on body composition and disease 
      activity in adolescents with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 401-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of nasogastric feeding with high- and low-fat,
      peptide-based diets on body composition and disease activity was studied in
      adolescents with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Fourteen patients with active
      Crohn's disease (12 to 17 years) were fed exclusively through nasogastric
      feedings with two isocaloric, isonitrogenous, peptide-based diets, either with
      low- or high-fat content, for 3 weeks each in a randomized manner then were
      "crossed over" to the other diet for another 3 weeks of feeding. At the end of
      each 3-week period, urine and stools were collected for 72 hours for measuring
      energy absorption and nitrogen utilization (n = 6). Weight, height, triceps skin 
      folds, fat free body mass, and disease activity were also monitored (n = 14).
      RESULTS: There was no difference in any parameter of energy absorption or
      nitrogen utilization between the two formulas irrespective of the order in which 
      they were administered. The changes in nutritional parameters were also
      comparable with both formulas. There was a significant increase in weight, fat
      free body mass and triceps skinfold thickness during both the 3-week periods of
      feeding (p < .05). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the
      pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Peptide-based
      diets may be useful in restoring the fat free body mass and improving the disease
      activity in patients with Crohn's disease. A high fat (high medium-chain
      triglycerides) diet did not offer any nutritional advantage over a similar but
      low-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity during feeding with a low-fat
      diet was comparable to that with a high-fat diet. The improvement in disease
      activity seems to be associated with improvement in lean body mass irrespective
      of the type of diet used to achieve it.

TI  - Psychiatric evaluations of small intestine transplantation patients.
PG  - 25S-29S
AB  - We are gaining experience in small intestine transplantation, however, the
      procedure is still experimental. Morbidity and mortality can be significant with 
      frequent rehospitalizations. The indications for small intestine transplantation 
      are varied though most patients have developed short gut syndrome requiring total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutritional support. Patients may present with a
      chronic illness (such as Crohn's disease), chronic pain, and psychiatric
      comorbidity that may need to be addressed during the perioperative period. Faced 
      with the complicated postoperative course, transplant recipients develop a range 
      of endogenous and organic psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric treatment may be
      complicated by these factors in addition to the nutritional, biochemical, and
      metabolic abnormalities of a transplanted small intestine.

TI  - Therapeutic strategies for pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - The main aims of therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) in
      children and adolescents are (1) the induction and maintenance of remission, (2) 
      the correction of nutrient deficits and (3) the restoration of growth and
      maturation. These goals are reached with the use of a combination of therapeutic 
      methods, including pharmacologic agents, nutritional and psychological support,
      and surgical intervention. The commonly used drugs sulfasalazine, corticosteroids
      and metronidazole have all been shown to be safe and efficacious when given to
      children. Newer steroid preparations that are rapidly degraded either in the
      target tissue or elsewhere are being studied. Of these, budesonide currently
      shows promise as an efficacious drug with few side effects, but its use in
      children needs further study. Newer 5-amino-salicylate preparations such as
      Asacol have been shown to be effective in children, but the number of patients
      studied is small. Immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine and
      6-mercaptopurine appear to be safe and efficacious for children; cyclosporine has
      been used infrequently to treat refractory Crohn disease in children. The use of 
      other agents such as methotrexate, tacrolimus, monoclonal antibodies to
      cytokines, antibiotics and specific dietary products such as fish oils have not
      been intensively studied in children with Crohn disease. Nutritional therapy
      remains a mainstay of treatment because it corrects nutritional deficits,
      replaces losses and stimulates growth.

PG  - 884-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal disease is an unfrequent extraintestinal manifestation of
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease. CASE REPORT: A 12-year-old girl suffered from
      recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea and growth impairment due to Crohn's disease
      of ileocaecal region. After six months of nutritional rehabilitation, an
      ileo-caecal resection was performed because of intestinal stenosis. The surgical 
      procedure was followed by parietal abcess and cutaneous fistula. One year later, 
      a purulent secretion came out of the fistula associated with fever, hematuria and
      acute renal failure. Renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy. The course was
      favorable under parenteral nutrition and after surgical closure of the
      sigmoido-cutaneous fistula. The microscopic hematuria only persisted but the
      nephropathy did not relapse even during a further digestive exacerbation.
      CONCLUSION: IgA nephropathy has been reported in association with chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. Its mechanism remains unclear: increased mucosal IgA 
      production in inflammatory bowel, increased serum IgA and/or immune complex
      deposition in the renal mesangium appear the most relevant hypotheses.

PG  - 577-608
AB  - Despite intense investigative efforts, the causes of ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease remain elusive. The mainstay of medical therapy focuses on
      inhibition of the effects of the inflammatory mediators operant in inflammatory
      bowel disease because the causes of these two chronic disorders are unknown.
      During recent years, the physician's armamentarium for medical treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease has increased substantially. In this article, the
      current standard medical therapies available for treatment of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease are reviewed along with their efficacy; the side
      effects and status of other investigative drugs also are reviewed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess haemodynamics in patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) receiving total parenteral or enteral nutrition (TPEN).
      METHODS: We compared changes in systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) before and 
      after 48 courses of TPEN in 34 patients with CD and 19 courses of TPEN in 10
      patients with other gastrointestinal diseases. We simultaneously measured the
      Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: BP
      increased significantly during TPEN in CD patients (after: 85.1 +/- 7.4 mmHg vs. 
      before: 75.2 +/- 7.9 mmHg, P < 0.001). The increase in BP was negatively
      correlated with changes in the Crohn's disease activity index. BP decreased
      significantly after TPEN in patients with other diseases (P < 0.001), despite an 
      improvement in their general condition. There was no significant difference in
      volume status between CD patients and patients with other diseases. CONCLUSION:
      These findings suggest that determination of arterial blood pressure may be
      useful for assessing disease severity in patients with CD and that a fall in
      blood pressure may contribute to disease activity.

TI  - Elevation of serum interleukin-6 but not serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor in 
      children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 164-71
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
      and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R, CD25) in individuals with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of our study was to compare serum IL-6 
      and IL-2R levels to see if one marker better distinguished IBD from other
      intestinal disorders or better reflected disease activity. Blood samples were
      obtained from 41 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 22 with ulcerative
      colitis, 19 with other gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, and 13 with
      functional abdominal pain. Disease activity and disease location were determined 
      for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Serum levels of IL-6
      and IL-2R were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean
      serum levels of IL-6 were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in patients with
      Crohn's disease when compared with individuals with ulcerative colitis, other
      gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, or functional abdominal pain. By
      comparison, there was no significant difference in mean serum levels of IL-2R in 
      individuals with Crohn's disease compared with these other groups. Patients with 
      moderate/severe Crohn's disease had elevated mean serum levels of IL-6 and IL-2R 
      when compared with those with mild and inactive disease (p < 0.05); however,
      neither marker distinguished between inactive and mild disease. IL-6 correlated
      better with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; r = 0.57, p < 0.001) than
      did IL-2R (r = 0.28, p < 0.01). Our results suggest that elevated IL-6 levels a.e
      more likely to be seen in patients with Crohn's disease. Although IL-6 may be a
      better marker for Crohn's disease and active disease than IL-2R, it does not
      appear to offer any advantage over the ESR.

TI  - [Ambulatory education of patient with Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 411-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient education has been accepted widely over the past years as a
      valid component of disease management in patients with chronic diseases. The aim 
      of our study was to evaluate the effects of patient education in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Participation in a patient education program should
      increase the patient's disease-related knowledge and positively influence the
      patient's quality of life, depression, beliefs of internal control and social
      activity. METHODS: We studied 36 patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis: 18 were educated in four sessions, 18 were not educated (control-group).
      The following topics were presented: diagnosis, causes and course of disease;
      medication and surgery; nutrition and social benefits and stress management and
      coping with the disease. RESULTS: The effects of the program were evaluated
      before, immediately and three months after the intervention using questionnaires.
      Participants in the program showed a significant increase in knowledge after
      three months compared with the non-participants. There were positive, although
      not significant effects on psychosocial variables. CONCLUSION: Patient education 
      is a valuable means to increase knowledge of disease and treatment in patient's
      with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Effects on psychosocial variables
      need to be examined on a long term basis in larger patient groups.

TI  - Correlation of various Crohn's disease activity indexes in subgroups of patients 
      with primarily inflammatory or fibrostenosing clinical characteristics.
PG  - 40-3
AB  - Several activity indexes, including clinical variables, laboratory variables or
      both, have been proposed to assess the activity and severity of Crohn's disease
      (CD). Although activity indexes are commonly used in clinical trials, doubts
      exist as to whether it is correct to group together and quantify under the same
      numerical expression the very heterogeneous clinical manifestations of CD. The
      aim of our study was to try to establish a correlation between clinical and
      laboratory activity indexes of CD in subgroups of patients with primarily
      inflammatory or primarily fibrostenosing clinical characteristics. At least two
      activity indexes were calculated among 232 outpatient examinations in 61 CD
      patients. Indexes were classified as clinical, laboratory, or both. A close
      correlation was observed when indexes calculated on clinical variables were
      compared or when those that include only or prevalently laboratory parameters
      were compared. Conversely, the correlation between clinical and laboratory
      indexes tended to be poor. Taking into consideration the subgroups of patients,
      the correlation between clinical and laboratory indexes was high in primarily
      inflammatory disease but low in the primarily fibrostenosing form. The clinical
      activity of CD does not always reflect the quantity of inflammation measured by
      laboratory parameters. This is particularly true in primarily fibrostenosing
      disease. Different clinical patterns of CD should always be considered in the
      attempt to quantify with an activity index the activity and severity of disease.

TI  - Resting energy expenditure before and after surgical resection of gut lesions in 
      pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - In pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), resection of gut lesions is necessary to
      remove stenoses and when frequent relapses occur despite nutritional support and 
      medical treatment. After surgery, improved nutritional status and accelerated
      growth usually follow increased nutritional intake and lower doses of steroids.
      The aim of this study was to compare energy balance before and after surgery
      while nutritional intake and steroid therapy were unchanged. Eleven patients,
      aged 14.5 +/- 2.5 years and with mildly active CD, were explored 1 week before
      and 1 month after gut resection for stenosis (n = 7) and medical treatment
      failure (n = 4). Eleven matched children participated in the study as controls.
      Disease activity was assessed by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and
      serum orosomucoid concentration. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by
      indirect calorimetry, and fat-free body mass (FFM) was measured by anthropometry.
      The patients' mean REE decreased from 46.6 +/- 10.5 kcal/kg FFM/day before
      surgery to 42.6 +/- 10.3 kcal/kg FFM/day after surgery, while the controls' mean 
      REE was 39 +/- 7 kcal/kg FFM/day (analysis of variance, p = 0.02). After surgery,
      body weights were not significantly different, but the mean protein oxidation
      rate was reduced and arm muscle area was increased. Changes in REE per kilogram
      of FFM per day were not correlated with changes in orosomucoid serum
      concentrations (r2 = 0.35; p = 0.4). In conclusion, in children with mildly
      active CD, while nutritional intake and steroid therapy were maintained at
      preoperative levels, a significant decrease in REE and improved nitrogen
      utilisation were observed 1 month after resection of the CD gut lesion. This
      finding suggests better use of energy substrates when CD lesions are removed.

TI  - Cyclosporine and 6-mercaptopurine for active, refractory Crohn's colitis in
      children.
PG  - 1355-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open trial of treatment was conducted to determine 
      whether cyclosporine A (CSA) is effective in inducing remission in children with 
      severe, active Crohn's colitis refractory to other medical treatment and if
      remission may be maintained by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid 
      (5-ASA) after discontinuing CSA. METHODS: Ten children (five males, five
      females), ages 1.2-16 yr (mean 11), all had failed to respond to 4 wk of
      treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone and total parenteral nutrition/elemental
      diet; three were already receiving 6-mercaptopurine. CSA was initially given as a
      twice daily i.v. dosage and was switched to oral CSA when a clinical response was
      observed. At the same time, corticosteroids were switched to the oral route and
      tapered over the next 3 months. Patients were grouped by treatment outcome.
      "Responders" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA therapy, "relapsers"
      were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA but relapsed later, and
      nonresponders had not achieved remission after 4 wk of i.v. CSA. Responders were 
      given 6-MP with intent to discontinue CSA after 6 months and maintain remission
      by 6-MP and 5-ASA. RESULTS: There were seven responders to CSA. For all patients,
      the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) (score range 0-100) had a
      mean value of 55 (range 40-65) just before treatment; PCDAI improved to a mean of
      19 (range 5-42.5) after 2 wk of CSA therapy. Four of the seven responders
      discontinued CSA after 6 months and remain well on 6-MP and 5ASA alone for 22,
      13, 8, and 3 months. One patient had massive GI bleeding (from active Crohn's
      colitis), which stopped within 48 h of CSA treatment. There were three relapsers 
      (at 2-6 months of CSA), and three were nonresponders. Three patients who were
      already receiving 6-MP before CSA therapy either did not respond to CSA or
      relapsed while receiving it. The six nonresponders and relapsers required
      surgical resection. Transient side effects included hypertension responding to
      nifedipine in one child and hirsutism and tremors in another. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that CSA offers a good remission rate for children with severe Crohn's
      colitis failing other medical treatment, although relapse was common especially
      if the child was already on 6-MP. In addition, CSA may offer "temporizing"
      therapy in severe, active Crohn's colitis; this may allow surgery to be performed
      electively, with time for psychosocial and nutritional preparation before
      surgery.

AB  - We describe a 22-year-old man with Crohn's ileocolitis accompanied by intestinal 
      stenosis and ileovesical fistula in whom laparoscopically-assisted surgery was
      successfully performed after thorough nutritional therapy. Laparoscopic
      procedures are characterized by minimal access and minimal invasion, features
      which can contribute to the early recovery of patients who undergo surgery. It is
      suggested that laparoscopic (or laparoscopically-assisted) surgery after strict
      nutritional therapy can be effective in the treatment of patients with Crohn's
      disease who have intestinal complications.

TI  - Effect of pregnancy on the clinical course of a cohort of women with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - The incidence of relapses of inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy ranges from 
      20 to 35%. The effect of pregnancy on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      after pregnancy has been investigated here. During the survey period, 29
      pregnancies occurred in 18 Crohn's patients, and 25 in 19 ulcerative colitis
      patients. Incidence of relapses during pregnancy and post-partum was 14 and 17%
      in Crohn's, and 36 and 12% in ulcerative colitis. Fourteen Crohn's patients (17
      pregnancies) and 17 ulcerative colitis patients (19 pregnancies) were followed
      for 3 years before pregnancy and for 4 years after delivery. During the 3 years
      after pregnancy, the number of relapses/year was significantly lower compared to 
      the 3 years before pregnancy and to the incidence in controls, both in Crohn's (p
      < 0.05) and ulcerative colitis (p < 0.005). Changes in nutritional status were
      recorded in 41% of Crohn's, but in none of the ulcerative colitis patients. The
      reduced incidence of relapses following delivery in Crohn's patients was more
      marked in the 10 with normal nutritional status at the time of conception (70%
      reduction in number of relapses, p < 0.05), while in the 7 significantly
      underweight patients, the reduction was slight (27% reduction in number of
      relapses, p = NS). In conclusion, the incidence of relapses in the first 3 years 
      after pregnancy is lower than in the pre-pregnancy period. In Crohn's disease,
      the effect is more evident in patients with normal nutritional status at the time
      of conception than in malnourished patients.

TI  - Perianal Crohn's disease in children and adolescents.
PG  - 922-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the frequency, severity, course, and outcome of perianal
      Crohn's disease in children and adolescents. METHODS: Records of 141 children and
      adolescents with Crohn's disease were reviewed. Of these, 18 patients (eight
      female, 10 male) between 9 and 18 yr of age (nine blacks and nine whites) had
      significant perianal disease. The disease was classified on the basis external
      appearance, degree of inflammation, presence of infection or abscess formation,
      spread to vulva, loss of perineal body, and occurrence of anal canal stricture as
      being mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: Eight patients had severe involvement, 
      whereas moderate and mild degree of perianal disease was seen in six and four
      patients, respectively. Disease localization was as follows: pancolitis, 12;
      ileocolitis, four; and left colitis, two. Therapy with Azulfidine or 5-amino
      salicylic acid preparation, local and systemic steroids, metronidazole,
      immunosuppressives, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition was used in various
      combinations. Surgery was necessary in eight patients: in four for management of 
      anal canal stricture, incision and drainage of abscess in two, total
      proctocolectomy in one, and fecal diversion in an additional patient. Over a
      follow-up period ranging from 18 months to 15 yr, nine patients had partial
      improvement, whereas in the rest, the disease either did not improve or worsened.
      CONCLUSIONS: Severe, mutilating perianal Crohn's disease, causing significant
      tissue destruction, occurs in both sexes and is extremely refractory to treatment
      in the majority of patients. The outcome in mild and moderate disease is better.

TI  - Supplementary enteral nutrition maintains remission in paediatric Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liquid diets given enterally combined with "bowel rest' are
      efficacious in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but rapid recrudescence
      of gastrointestinal symptoms after resumption of a normal diet is common. AIMS:
      This study examined whether continuation of enteral nutrition as a nocturnal
      supplement to an ad libitum daytime intake of a normal diet increased the length 
      of remission of Crohn's disease in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children and
      adolescents with active Crohn's disease treated successfully with exclusive
      enteral nutrition were classified retrospectively according to whether they
      continued supplementary enteral nutrition or not. Time to relapse and linear
      growth were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Between January 1986 and
      December 1992, 65 patients aged 7-17 years (mean (SD) 13.6 (2.1) years) (36
      males, 29 females) with Crohn's disease in exacerbation were treated for > or =
      four weeks by bowel rest and nasogastric tube feeding of an oligopeptide or amino
      acid based formula. At first follow up visit, remission (fall in Paediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index, PCDAI to < or = 20) was achieved in 47 of 65
      (72%) patients. Subsequently, 20 of these 47 (43%) relapsed by six months and 28 
      of 47 (60%) by 12 months. Patients who continued nasogastric supplementary
      feeding (n = 28) after resumption of an otherwise normal diet remained well
      longer than those who discontinued nocturnal supplements completely (n = 19) (p <
      0.02). Furthermore, continued use of nasogastric supplements before completion of
      puberty was associated with improved linear growth. CONCLUSION: After successful 
      treatment of active Crohn's disease by exclusive enteral nutrition, supplementary
      enteral nutrition without restriction of normal diet is associated with
      prolongation of remission and improved linear growth in children and adolescents.

AB  - The choice of medical therapies for Crohn's disease continues to grow. Although
      our understanding of the mechanisms of the disease is incomplete, increasing
      knowledge of the pathogenesis of inflammation in general and Crohn's disease in
      particular allows targeting of therapies at various points in the
      immunoinflammatory cascade. In addition, the division of Crohn's disease into
      subtypes by location, aggressiveness, and the presence or absence of perianal and
      fistulizing disease allows the tailoring of medical therapy to the individual
      patient. For those patients with moderate to severe symptoms or frequent flares
      of disease activity, and those who have required surgical resection, maintenance 
      therapy can substantially reduce the rate of recurrence. Despite these advances, 
      available medical therapies for Crohn's disease remain imperfect, as evidenced by
      their sometimes substantial toxicities and the continued frequent need for
      surgery.

AB  - Metabolic interaction between the intestinal microflora and the host has been
      suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. Elemental or low-fat, low-residual diets in patients with Crohn's
      disease or ulcerative colitis are reported to decrease anaerobic bacteria and to 
      change the composition of the intestinal microflora. We examined the effect of an
      indigestible agent, 4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose (lactosucrose), which is
      selectively utilized by intestinal Bifidobacterium, on the composition of the
      intestinal microflora. After the administration of lactosucrose to two patients
      with Crohn's disease and five patients with ulcerative colitis for 2 weeks,
      significant induction of the growth of Bifidobacterium was observed, and
      significant reduction in the population level of Bacteroidaceae was seen. Bowel
      movements improved in four patients. The intestinal environment, estimated by
      measuring fecal pH, fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids and putrid products, 
      and the urinary secretion of indican, also improved in these patients. These
      results suggest that lactosucrose may be useful for patients with chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Control of gastric pH with ranitidine in patients with Crohn's disease receiving 
      total parenteral nutrition. Comparison of two intravenous regimens.
PG  - 6-11
AB  - Eleven patients with Crohn's disease in remission who were receiving total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) underwent continuous intragastric 24-h pH monitoring
      before and during ranitidine administration. The patients were randomly allocated
      to receive 200 mg/day (group 1) or 400 mg/day (group 2) of ranitidine by
      continuous infusion. The mean basal 24-h gastric pH was sustained at a low value.
      After raintidine administration, the mean pH increased significantly both in
      group 1 (from 2.13 to 3.28) and in group 2 (from 1.91 to 3.36), with the mean
      holding-time at pH-3 also increasing significantly in both groups. There were no 
      differences in the mean pH or holding-time at pH-3 between the two groups during 
      ranitidine administration; however, the plasma ranitidine concentration was
      significantly higher in group 2. These findings indicate that the continuous
      infusion of a standard dose of ranitidine exerted a maximal inhibitory effect on 
      the sustained hyperacidity induced by TPN, but that this infusion was unable to
      maintain the intragastric pH level at above 3.5.

TI  - [Sarcoidosis in children with digestive manifestations].
PG  - 141-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric involvement is the least rare among digestive localizations
      of sarcoidosis, as well in adults as in children. When it is to be seen at the
      beginning of the disease, it may cause difficulties in the diagnostic, especially
      with Crohn's disease. CASE REPORT: Gastric ulcers were detected in a 12 year-old 
      girl, of African origin, who complained about epigastric pain. Eighteen months
      later, diarrhea, poor growing, uveitis and inflammatory biological signs led to a
      probable diagnostic of Crohn's disease. Endoscopy seemed to confirm this
      diagnostic with granulomatous lesions on gastric biopsies. The absence of
      radiological anomalies of the digestive tract and the poor efficiency of the
      medical treatment led to question this diagnosis and to assert that of
      sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case allows to emphasize the rare involvement of
      the digestive tract in sarcoidosis and the aspects common both to Crohn's disease
      and sarcoidosis.

TI  - Effects of cigarette smoking on the long-term course of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In Crohn's disease, smoking increases the risk for surgical
      procedures. The influence of smoking on the overall severity of the disease
      remains controversial. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of
      smoking on the long-term course of Crohn's disease and the relationship between
      smoking and therapy. METHODS: The medical charts of 400 consecutive patients
      whose smoking habits were specified by direct interview were reviewed. RESULTS:
      Frequency and extent of excisional surgery were not significantly different in
      smokers and nonsmokers, but smokers required more glucocorticoids and
      immunosuppressive drugs. The effect of smoking on the need for immunosuppressive 
      drugs was dose-dependent and was significant in women but not in men. For female 
      smokers, the 10-year risk of immunosuppressive therapy was 52% +/- 11% compared
      with 24% +/- 10% for nonsmokers (P < 0.001). The risk of surgery increased only
      in patients who smoked and did not take immunosuppressive drugs. The surgical
      rate increased significantly during smoking in 19 patients who started smoking
      after diagnosis and decreased significantly in 34 patients who stopped compared
      with matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who smoke, particularly women and
      heavy smokers, run a high risk of developing severe disease. Immunosuppressive
      therapy neutralizes the influence of smoking on surgical rates.

      of basic red cell ferritin.
PG  - 331-5
AB  - The iron status of 22 children and adolescents with Crohn's disease (mean age: 13
      years) was evaluated. Eleven patients were suffering from active disease with
      inflammation, identified by at least one abnormal value for serum orosomucoid,
      C-reactive protein or sedimentation rate (group I). Eleven patients were in
      clinical remission and showed no biological evidence of inflammation (group II). 
      Hemoglobin and red cell indices, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron,
      transferrin, serum ferritin and basic red cell ferritin were determined in all
      patients. The usual indicators of iron status, particularly serum ferritin, were 
      affected by the inflammatory processes, but basic red cell ferritin appeared to
      be independent of inflammation. Basic red cell ferritin can therefore be
      considered to be a reliable indicator of iron status in children and adolescents 
      with Crohn's disease.

PG  - 1071-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Inflammatory bowel diseases have an important impact on the daily
      life of patients. This impact can be measured by the evaluation of the health
      related quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop and to validate a
      questionnaire of quality of life in a French population. METHODS: The
      questionnaire comprised 70 items and was completed in 15 min. It was made up of
      a) a general questionnaire of 36 items (SF-36) exploring daily physical and
      social functioning, mental and general health, body pain and vitality. A sleep
      module of 6 items was added. b) a specific questionnaire of 28 items (RFIPC),
      exploring the concerns of the patients. The questionnaire was self-administered
      to 101 patients with Crohn's disease (57 F. 44 M. mean age: 35 years, acute
      disease: 28%, inpatients: 27%), 96 patients with ulcerative colitis (38 F. 58 M. 
      mean age: 39 years, acute disease: 53%, inpatients: 21%). Each patient was sex
      and age matched with a healthy control. RESULTS: The psychometric analysis
      confirmed the validation of the questionnaire for the item's convergent validity,
      internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient being > 0.70), analyses of
      discrimination. Scores of each scale of SF-36 were worse in patients than in
      controls. Scores of patients with active disease were worse than those of
      patients with quiescent disease. Scores were comparable in patients with Crohn's 
      disease and with ulcerative colitis except for score of pain which was worse in
      acute Crohn's disease. The most important concerns of patients were the uncertain
      nature of the disease, energy level and having surgery. CONCLUSION: This study
      allowed the validation of a questionnaire for the evaluation of the quality of
      life in French patients with inflammatory bowel disease and provides first
      indications which need to be confirmed by future epidemiological studies.

      disease].
PG  - 852-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Artificial nutrition prior to bowel resection has not been evaluated 
      fully. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of preoperative
      artificial nutrition upon postoperative complications, length of resected bowel
      and relapses of Crohn disease. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1994, 108 consecutive
      patients underwent bowel resection for Crohn disease. Thirty nine patients had
      received exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 14) or parenteral nutrition (n = 25)
      for 19 +/- 10 days. Patients who had received artificial nutrition were more
      malnourished and had complicated Crohn disease (fistulae, abscesses) more often
      than patients operated without artificial nutrition. After 19 days of artificial 
      nutrition, the nutritional state of patients was not significantly improved.
      Postoperative complication rate was higher in patients operated after artificial 
      nutrition (33 vs. 16%; P = 0.03). Using multivariate prognosis analysis, the
      extent of colic resection was significantly associated with postoperative
      complications (P = 0.0003). Length of resected bowel and relapse rates were
      similar in patients with or without preoperative nutrition. CONCLUSION:
      Artificial nutrition prior to bowel resection for Crohn's disease is indicated in
      patients with the most severe form of the disease. A preoperative nutrition of 19
      days does not seem to reduce postoperative complications nor the length of
      resected bowel.

AB  - The paper reviews publication on the use of complete parenteral feeding in the
      multimodality treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Complete parenteral
      feeding was performed in patients with skeletization and physical retardation, in
      severe diseases, in inefficiency or intolerance of conventional therapy with
      sulfanilamides and steroids, in those who had intestinal fistulas, as well in the
      preparation of patients for surgical treatment. The use of complete parenteral
      feeding, under the above circumstances allow one to achieve persistent remission,
      spontaneous healing of intestinal fistulas, elimination of abnormal metabolism,
      nutrition, constitution, water-electrolyte balance, to reduce a surgical risk and
      the incidence of postoperative complications and the length of patients' hospital
      stay.

      woman, non-exclusive ambulatory parenteral nutrition was given during the entire 
      duration of gestation in a patient with short bowel syndrome, maintaining good
      nutritional status and normal delivery at term of an eutrophic infant; Crohn's
      disease relapsed one month post partum. In the second patient, Crohn's disease
      was less severe and remission occurred without treatment. Prophylactic cesarean
      was required due to multiple perineal scars resulting from surgical treatment of 
      Crohn-related fistulae. The main problems with pregnancy in patients with Crohn's
      disease are discussed.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and nutrition].
PG  - 14S-24S
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential
      mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition
      is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory 
      bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional
      factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is
      yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve
      nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and
      adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not
      substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral
      nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe
      disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and
      intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in
      ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral
      nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in
      active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy 
      with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that
      nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There
      is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets 
      such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of
      formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether
      newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short
      chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this 
      field are warranted.

TI  - Prevalence of essential fatty acid deficiency in patients with chronic
      gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 12-23
AB  - Patients with chronic intestinal disorders causing malabsorption, nutritional
      losses through diarrhea, or catabolic illness would be expected to have essential
      fatty acid (EFA) deficiency (EFAD), but such deficiency has not been demonstrated
      in patients treated in accordance with the prevailing standard of care. We
      studied plasma fatty acid patterns of 56 reference or control subjects and 47
      patients with chronic intestinal disorders (mostly Crohn's disease) using
      high-resolution capillary column gas-liquid chromatography. Patients exhibited a 
      shift in fatty acid metabolism similar to that previously shown to be associated 
      with EFAD. Compared with control subjects, patients had (1) decreased
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels (43.7% v 50.4%, P < .0001), (2)
      increased monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) levels (25.8% v 22.0%, P < .0001),
      (3) higher ratios of mead (20:3 omega 9) to arachidonic (20:4 omega 6) acid
      (0.020 v 0.013, P < .04), and (4) lower concentrations of total (214 v 284 mg/dL,
      P < .01), saturated ([SFA] 63 v 75 mg/dL, P < .001), MUFA (56 v 63 mg/dL, P <
      .001), and PUFA (93 v 143 mg/dL, P < .001). Patients had metabolic shifts toward 
      increased production of MUFA and an increased ratio of derivatives to precursors 
      of omega 6 fatty acids, shifts that occur when cells are EFA-deficient. More than
      25% of the patients had biochemical evidence of EFAD according to at least one
      criterion. Optimal diagnosis requires a concurrent evaluation of concentrations
      of fatty acids in plasma and in lipoproteins (percent fatty acids). On indices of
      EFA status that depend on percents, ratios, or concentrations of fatty acids or
      on the production of abnormal fatty acids, the patients were between patients
      with severe whole-body EFAD and healthy subjects, a state referred to as absolute
      EFA insufficiency. Patients with chronic intestinal disease should be evaluated
      for likely EFA deficiencies and imbalances, and treated with substantial amounts 
      of supplements rich in EFAs, such as oral vegetable and fish oils, or intravenous
      lipids if necessary.

      findings: (1) A semielemental diet was as effective as an elemental diet in
      inducing remission. (2) A low-residue diet was useful for the maintenance of
      remission, with the effect depending upon the quantity given. (3) Intractability 
      to enteral nutrition was found in patients with long-standing disease, in those
      with severe activity, and in those with colonic disease. Currently there is
      insufficient evidence to make specific recommendations for altering accepted
      indications for nutritional therapy.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation in Crohn's
      disease: Japanese cooperative Crohn's disease study.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) often flares up and requires frequent hospitalization and/or
      surgery. Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to
      prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its
      therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population.
      Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and 
      to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410
      patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29
      institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission 
      and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly
      higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with
      ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but
      no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative
      remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie
      content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was
      found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to
      prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be
      superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement,
      and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED 
      to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Efficacy of nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 83-7
AB  - We investigated the effect of nutritional therapy with an elemental diet (ED) for
      active Crohn's disease. One hundred and thirty-nine patients with Crohn's disease
      were enrolled in this study. Remission was judged to be present when the
      International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease score was < or = 1 and
      the CRP and ESR values were within the respective normal ranges. An amount of
      30kcal per 1kg of ideal body weight (IBW) per day was administered enterally, and
      the effect on the induction of remission in relation to various patient
      background factors, such as disease type, history of bowel resection, and the
      presence/absence of complications, was determined. An excellent remission rate
      was achieved in those patients to whom an adequate amount of ED could be
      administered. Remission rates were lower in the patient groups with any of the
      following complications: stenotic bowel lesions, abdominal masses, fistulas, and 
      anal lesions. Even in those groups in which stenotic lesions or abdominal masses 
      were present, when adequate amounts of ED could be administered, the remission
      rate did not differ from that in the groups without these complications. The
      remission rates in the groups with and without fistulas at any site, including
      fistulas in the anal region, were 40.0% and 82.5%, respectively, with remission
      being considerably easier to achieve in the patients without fistulas. Similarly,
      remission was difficult to achieve when anal lesions were present. These results 
      suggest that, for active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy with ED ( > or =
      35kcal/kg IBW) should be enthusiastically administered, and in patients in whom
      the presence of complications necessitates therapy for 3 months or more, this
      point be considered to indicate a possible surgical approach.

TI  - Strictureplasty for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - 135-8
AB  - Strictureplasty has recently been advocated in the treatment of obstructive
      strictures of the small bowel in patients with Crohn's disease. In this group
      study, results for 69 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent strictureplasty
      were analyzed by sending questionnaires to 13 institutions belonging to the
      Research Committee of Inflammatory Bowel Disease of the Japanese Ministry of
      Health and Welfare. No mortality and anastomotic leakage were observed.
      Strictureplasties of both the Heineke-Mikulicz and Finney varieties were
      considered to be safe procedures, even though the sutures had to be applied at
      the slightly inflammed site. The median follow up was 37 months (range, 0-133
      months), and 12 patients needed reoperation. The cumulative 3-year operation-free
      rate was 92.5% and the 5-year rate was 70.3%. The site of the lesion, the
      strictureplasty procedure, and previous history of small bowel resection did not 
      significantly influence the operation-free intervals. The cumulative 5-year
      operation-free rate of the group treated with home elemental enteral nutrition
      (83.3%) was better than that of the non-treated group (65.3%). Strictureplasty
      was found to be a safe and effective surgical procedure for high-risk patients
      with Crohn's disease in whom an appropriate length of bowel should be saved.

TI  - Remaining small bowel endoscopic lesions at surgery have no influence on early
      anastomotic recurrences in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1949-52
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We recently demonstrated that 65% of patients operated on for Crohn's
      disease (CD) had lesions of the small bowel at perioperative endoscopy (POE).
      These lesions were unrecognized before surgery in more than half of the patients.
      The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of endoscopic small
      bowel lesions let in place at time of surgery on further anastomotic endoscopic
      relapse. METHODS: Twenty one patients (10 women, 11 men, mean age 34 yr) had an
      enteroscopy from the terminal ileum to the ligament of Treitz during an
      ileocolectomy performed for CD. All patients were subsequently enrolled in a
      placebo-controlled trial of mesalazine for the prevention of early endoscopic
      relapse; 10 patients received placebo, and 11 received mesalazine (1.5 g/day) for
      12 wk after surgery. At the end of this trial, they all had a colonoscopy with
      inspection of the anastomosis and the neoterminal ileum. RESULTS: POE was
      completed up to the angle of Treitz in all 21 patients. In 10/21 cases (47%),
      mild lesions were found distributed at random along the small intestine 30 cm
      beyond the resection margin. At colonoscopy performed 12 wk later, lesions were
      found in 11/21 cases (52%) between section margin and were estimated to be 25 cm 
      over the anastomosis. Endoscopic recurrence occurred in 5/10 patients who
      received placebo and 6/11 patients who received mesalazine. Endoscopic recurrence
      occurred in 5/10 patients having lesions at POE and in 6/11 patients who had no
      lesions. There was no relationship between endoscopic recurrence at 12 wk and
      presence of lesions at initial POE, whatever the postoperative treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Endoscopic lesions let in place after "curative" surgery have no
      influence on early endoscopic anastomotic recurrences in CD.

TI  - Inflammatory diseases of the colon. Narrowing a wide field of symptoms and
      possible causes.
PG  - 46-8, 54, 57-8 passim
AB  - Symptoms and physical findings may indicate the severity of inflammatory disease 
      of the colon, but detailed history taking is needed to limit the wide spectrum of
      possible causes. Infectious causes should be ruled out before other disease is
      assumed to be present. No single test is sufficient to diagnose ulcerative
      colitis or Crohn's disease. Laboratory testing, histologic assessment, endoscopy,
      radiology, and bowel studies are often necessary in differential diagnosis.
      Because of the systemic nature of colitis, manifestations in the musculoskeletal,
      ocular, dermatologic, hepatobiliary, and other systems may occur and provide
      clues. Treatment depends on the type and severity of disease. Sulfasalazine
      (Azulfidine), sulfa-free 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, and corticosteroids are
      mainstays of treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Supportive care
      and judicious use of antimicrobial therapy are usually effective in colitis due
      to bacterial, parasitic, and sexually transmitted infections and are useful for
      symptoms caused by colonic ischemia and vasculitis. Colitis resulting from
      radiation therapy may present several years after the procedure and can be
      difficult to diagnose and treat. In many cases of inflammatory colon disease,
      especially chronic conditions, consultation with a gastroenterologist is highly
      recommended.

TI  - The effect of treatment on lymphokine-secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa of
      children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 547-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown both interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon
      gamma (IFN) to be elevated in patients with active Crohn's disease compared to
      ulcerative colitis or non-inflammatory bowel disease controls. However the effect
      of treatment on these lymphokines has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Using a reverse haemolytic plaque assay the percentage of lymphokine-secreting
      cells was determined in the intestinal mucosa of children with Crohn's disease
      before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either enteral nutrition, cyclosporin 
      or steroids. RESULTS: Before treatment, a high percentage of cells isolated from 
      mucosal biopsies secreted IL-2 or interferon-gamma. Eight weeks' treatment with
      the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin, or with corticosteroids, produced a
      significant reduction in the percentage of IL-2 secreting cells, although only
      for the former was there also a reduction in interferon-gamma secreting cells.
      Enteral nutrition however, produced a reduction in lymphokine-secreting cells
      equivalent to cyclosporin and produced the best histological and clinical
      improvement. CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition and cyclosporin can down-regulate
      lymphokine secretion in the gut in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Nutritional considerations in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 597-611
AB  - Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there
      are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC.
      Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the
      treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as
      primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been
      associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is
      resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but
      they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused 
      by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides 
      an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional
      support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who
      are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have

TI  - Practical aspects of enteral nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition regimens achieve remission from active Crohn's
      disease at rates comparable to steroids and total parenteral nutrition. Despite
      their increasing use there has to date been no assessment of patient tolerance or
      practical difficulties involved. METHODS: We investigated 147 treatments with
      elemental diet in 89 patients and followed this with an anonymous questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: Sip feeding was successfully introduced in 85% with nasogastric feeding 
      being necessary in 22 (15%). Nausea and postural hypotension were common in the
      first week of treatment but vomiting was only seen in three patients who were
      sensitive to the formula used. Two patients each had caffeine withdrawal symptoms
      and hypoglycemia and a further four had food-related night terrors. Our
      experience suggests that caution is necessary if this treatment is used in
      elderly subjects. Although the diets are perceived as being unpalatable, only six
      patients found taste to be a problem after the first week of treatment. The main 
      problem with long-term treatment was the large daily volume requirement, which
      was overcome by increasing the concentration of the feed. Eighty percent of
      patients responded to the questionnaire, and 65% stated that they would opt for
      treatment with elemental diet again in the case of a further relapse.
      CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet seems to be an acceptable and well-tolerated form of 
      treatment in Crohn's disease.

TI  - How effective is enteral nutrition in inducing clinical remission in active
      Crohn's disease? A meta-analysis of the randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 356-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate, using meta-analysis
      techniques, whether enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission
      in active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Randomized trials either comparing enteral
      nutrition with steroids or comparing elemental (amino acid-based) with
      nonelemental diets were selected using MEDLINE (1984 to 1994), reference lists
      from published articles, reviews, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal
      meetings. Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (four published as
      abstracts). Crude rates for induction of remission were collected on an
      intention-to-treat basis by three independent observers. Each study was given a
      quality score, based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio
      (OR) for all type of enteral diets compared with steroid therapy was 0.35 (95%
      CI, 0.23 to 0.53). This result was similar for the best studies (by quality
      score) combined, for trials using tube feeding combined, and when noncompliant
      patients were withdrawn. Further subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of
      the type of diet administered. Peptide-based diets were significantly inferior to
      steroids (pooled OR, 0.32; CI, 0.20 to 0.52). There was a trend to lower
      remission rate after elemental diets than after steroids (pooled OR, 0.44; CI
      0.17 to 1.12). On the other hand, pooled OR for whole protein-based diets
      compared with elemental diets was 1.28 (CI, 0.40 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data
      available to date show that steroids are better than enteral nutrition to induce 
      remission in active Crohn's disease. These results are more evident when
      peptide-based diets are administered, but they are not conclusive when either
      elemental or whole protein-based diets are used.

AB  - Cyclosporine recently has become part of the treatment regimen for patients with 
      refractory inflammatory bowel disease, though it is still considered
      investigational for that purpose. However, little attention has been given to the
      potential hepatotoxicity associated with cyclosporine administration. This can be
      especially significant in patients with preexisting abnormalities of liver
      function, including those induced by total parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Prolonged use of gastrostomy for enteral hyperalimentation in children with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1084-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety of gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement in
      children with Crohn's disease and the efficacy of prolonged enteral
      hyperalimentation in children with growth failure complicating Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: Twenty children with Crohn's disease and growth failure were offered
      enteral hyperalimentation via nasogastric tube (NG-tube) for treatment of growth 
      arrest, with follow-up for complications, compliance, and response to nutritional
      support. The use of a G-tube was offered to children who refused to use the
      NG-tube. Medical and surgical management were provided as dictated by the disease
      activity. RESULTS: Thirteen children were started on NG-tube feeds, and five were
      started on G-tube feeds after refusal to use an NG-tube at the outset. Two
      children required surgery at the time of diagnosis and had a G-tube placed during
      the operation. Nine of 13 children found the use of an NG-tube too disruptive and
      were later changed to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or
      surgically-placed G-tube. A total of 16 children had a percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy (eight children) or a surgically-placed G-tube (eight children) for
      6-29 months. Two of those children had endoscopic evidence of gastroduodenal
      Crohn's disease, and six had microscopic patchy chronic gastritis. Minor
      complications occurred in five of the 16, including external leakage, button
      dislodgement, local pain, and local wound infection. At this time, the G-tube has
      been removed from 13 children, 12 of whom had prompt and complete healing of the 
      G-tube site and one of whom had a small gastrocutaneous fistula that required
      suture for successful closure. Poor compliance with G-tube feeds was observed in 
      four of 16 children. During the period of nutritional support, there was
      resumption of normal growth rates for all; in addition, eight of 16 had catch-up 
      growth. CONCLUSION: Nutritional therapy is important in the management of
      children with growth failure due to Crohn's disease, though it may not be the
      only factor affecting growth. G-tubes are safe and well tolerated by children
      with Crohn's disease and should be offered to those children who do not tolerate 
      prolonged use of an NG-tube.

TI  - Hyperbaric oxygenation in severe perineal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 609-14
AB  - PURPOSE: Perineal involvement in Crohn's disease is a common and distressing
      condition, often refractory to medical or surgical treatments. Recent reports
      suggest the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) in the healing of perineal
      lesions. We evaluated HBO in severe patients with perineal Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: Ten consecutive patients (8 women, 2 men; mean age, 30 years) were
      studied. There were four superficial fissures, four cavitating ulcers, six low or
      superficial fistulas, two high fistulas, and one irreversible anal stenosis. All 
      patients had received one or more medical treatments without healing the perineal
      lesions, and all had had previous surgery for perineal lesions. RESULTS: Two
      patients discontinued HBO after a few sessions and did not complete treatment.
      Eight patients completed at least 30 HBO sessions and were evaluable. At the end 
      of the procedure, six of eight patients treated were healed, three completely and
      three partially. All patients who healed completely received HBO as an additional
      treatment to local perineal surgery. CONCLUSION: HBO might be useful as a last
      resort treatment of chronic perineal Crohn's disease, resistant to other
      treatments or as a complement to surgery.

AB  - Since the early 1970s there has been considerable debate over the role of
      nutritional support in the treatment of patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. The role of enteral feeding as a primary therapeutic option in patients

      of nutritional support both as an adjunct to standard medical therapy and as a
      primary therapeutic option.

TI  - The short-bowel syndrome.
PG  - 514-20
AB  - Patients with a short bowel have usually had a bowel resection for Crohn's
      disease. Two types of short-bowel patient can be distinguished: those with a
      jejunostomy and those with their jejunum anastomosed to a functioning colon. Both
      types of patient have problems with macronutrient absorption, although those with
      a colon experience fewer problems because some energy from unabsorbed
      carbohydrate is salvaged in the colon. Patients with a jejunostomy have problems 
      with large stomal losses of water, sodium and magnesium, whereas those with a
      jejuno-colic anastomosis rarely have problems with water and electrolyte
      absorption. Patients with a jejunostomy 100-200 cm from the duodeno-jejunal
      flexure ('absorbers') usually absorb more from the diet than they pass through
      the stoma and therefore require oral electrolyte or nutrient supplements. Those
      with a residual jejunal length of less than 100 cm usually secrete more from the 
      stoma than they take in orally ('secretors') and therefore require long-term
      parenteral fluid or nutrient supplements. A high output resulting from a
      jejunostomy is treated by reducing the oral intake of hypotonic fluid,
      administering a sipped glucose-saline solution and, often, by giving drugs that
      reduce intestinal motility (most effective in absorbers) or gastrointestinal
      secretions (most effective in secretors). Gallstones are common both in
      short-bowel patients with and in those without a colon (45%), and calcium oxalate
      renal stones occur in the former (25%). However, it is now possible to provide
      adequate nutrition and fluid supplements for most patients with a short bowel,
      and the prospects for the rehabilitation of such patients are good.

      therapeutic aspects of the condition. They stress the value of upper endoscopy
      with multiple biopsies in providing the diagnosis. Treatment is essentially
      medical, surgery being restricted to fistulas after failure of medical treatment 
      and parenteral nutrition, and to severe stenoses after failure of endoscopic
      dilatation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to look for seasonal fluctuations in the clinical
      course of Crohn's disease. Eighty-three patients residing in the Paris area were 
      included in the study and they had all undergone continuous clinical monitoring
      throughout the first three years of the disease. During this period, the clinical
      activity of the disease was ranked monthly on a semi-qualitative scale ranging
      from 0 to 4. The dates of corticosteroid treatment and of resection surgery
      carried out during the first three years of the disease were also recorded. The
      mean clinical score varied significantly (P < 0.0001) for different months of the
      year, the three highest scores being recorded during the three months of
      Spring-time (April, May and June). The number of months of corticosteroid
      treatment differed significantly (P < 0.05) for the various seasons, the six
      highest values being reported during Spring and Summer months. The number of
      intestinal resections differed significantly (p < 0.05) during different seasons,
      the highest incidence again being reported during Spring. This study demonstrates
      seasonal variations in the clinical course of Crohn' disease in the Paris area,
      with a peak occurring in the Spring.

      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)].
PG  - 161-4
AB  - The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of peripheral
      parenteral nutrition (PNN) in a homogeneous group of patients who had not had
      surgery, and to determine whether the deterioration of the nutritional state can 
      be avoided while keeping the advantages of the administration of a peripheral
      route. We have included 7 patients (4 male and 3 female) with an acute episode of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each received 1780 kcal/day (1500 non-protein
      kcal 66% as fats, and 33% as glucose), with a kcal/g of N ratio of 160 by means
      of the preparation technique of "all in one". The anthropometric parameters:
      initial and final weight (58.5 +/- 12 vs. 57.3 +/- 11); triceps skin fold (14.1
      +/- 4 vs. 14.1 +/- 4), and mean circumference of the arm (25.1 +/- 3 vs. 25.0 +/-
      3), did not give any significant differences during the treatment period. In the 
      biochemical data there were no significant differences either, except for the
      final level of serum albumin (3.44 +/- 0.28), which was significantly higher than
      the initial value (3.11 +/- 0.38) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of the treatment 
      was 12 days (range 6-18). There was no case of phlebitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Meta-analysis of enteral nutrition as a primary treatment of active Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1056-67
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The efficacy of enteral nutrition as primary therapy of active
      Crohn's disease is controversial. The aim of the study was to compare by
      meta-analysis the likelihood of clinical response to liquid diet therapy vs.
      corticosteroids and to assess the importance of formula composition to efficacy. 
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing exclusive enteral nutrition with 
      corticosteroids and elemental with nonelemental formulas were identified through 
      a combination of computerized and hand-searching techniques. Rates of clinical
      remission of active Crohn's disease, based on the intention-to-treat principle,
      were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios for
      likelihood of clinical response were calculated. RESULTS: In eight trials
      comprising 413 patients, enteral nutrition was inferior to corticosteroids
      (pooled odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.53). In five trials
      comprising 134 patients, there was no difference in the efficacy of elemental
      versus nonelemental formulas (pooled odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval,
      0.41-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are more effective than enteral
      nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Limited sample size
      precludes definitive conclusions about the importance of formula composition in
      the efficacy of enteral nutrition; however, data analyzed in this study do not
      support an advantage to elemental feedings compared with a polymeric formulation.

TI  - Latent pulmonary function abnormalities in children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 377-80
AB  - Recently, latent pulmonary involvement has been described in adult patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease. It is unknown, however, whether this also occurs in
      children, and whether the pulmonary abnormalities differ between the acute phase 
      and remission. The incidence of pulmonary abnormalities has been investigated in 
      26 children with acute or quiescent Crohn's disease in terms of the following
      parameters: clinical pulmonary symptoms, chest roentgenograms and pulmonary
      function tests, including lung transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO). One
      child had a severe digital clubbing. Chest radiographs were normal in all
      subjects. No significant differences were found between acute and quiescent phase
      for pulmonary volumes and expiratory flows, but TLCO (% predicted) was
      significantly decreased during the active phase of the disease as compared to
      remission (53 +/- 15 vs 81 +/- 19% predicted). These data suggest that latent
      pulmonary involvement is also present in a paediatric population with active
      Crohn's disease, despite a short disease history and absence of smoking. Although
      the nature of this abnormality remains unclear, this extradigestive epiphenomenon
      should be taken into account with respect to the aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Total enteral nutrition support improves body composition of patients with active
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 95-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies using indirect calorimetry in Crohn's disease have
      suggested that with weight loss there is a proportionally greater decrease in
      body fat along with a spring of lean mass. This study analyzed body composition
      (compared with that of controls) by direct methods in a group of 30 patients with
      active Crohn's disease and further evaluated the effects of nutrition support on 
      body composition. METHODS: Total body protein was assessed by neutron activation,
      fat was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, water was assessed by
      bioelectric impedance analysis, and potassium was assessed by gamma-ray
      technique. These measurements were repeated in patients with Crohn's disease
      after 3 weeks of enteral nutrition by feeding tube that provided 35 nonprotein
      kcal/kg of ideal body weight. RESULTS: Compared with age- and sex-matched
      controls, patients had lost (on average) 11.3 kg (16%) of body weight (p <
      .0005), including 5.1 kg (30%) of fat (p < .0005), 2.2 kg (19%) of protein (p <
      .025), 3.7 kg (10%) of water (p = NS), and 24.9 g (21%) of total body potassium
      (p < .01). After enteral feeding, body weight increased by 1.9 +/- 0.3 kg (p <
      .0005). Weight gain was accompanied by an increase in body protein (0.3 +/- 0.1
      kg), fat (0.3 +/- 0.1 kg), and water (1.1 +/- 0.4 kg) (all p < .025), and by a
      nonsignificant increase in total body potassium. The weight gain of approximately
      2 kg consisted of 65% water, 18% fat, and 18% protein, thus comprising a normal
      proportion of body composition. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced body weight in patients with
      Crohn's disease compared with that in controls was due to less fat tissue. With
      modest nutritional repletion, proportionate gains in all body compartments are
      possible.

AB  - Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease; deficiencies of multiple
      micronutrients and macronutrients can present a diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge to the clinician. Enteral and parenteral nutrition have been used as
      adjunctive therapy to correct or prevent malnutrition in inflammatory bowel
      disease. In addition, some authors have advocated enteral and parenteral
      nutrition as primary therapy of acute inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy of
      these nutritional therapies in the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis is reviewed.

TI  - [Prevention of infectious postoperative complications in Crohn's disease].
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Mortality and post-operative complications are elevated in Crohn's disease, for
      many reasons: pre-existing septic complications, malnutrition, impaired
      cell-mediated immunity, failure to identify enteric fistulas and/or abdominal
      abscess during surgical operation. From 1984 to 1996 in 383 patients with Crohn's
      disease we performed 426 surgical procedures, observing post-operative
      complications in 28 of these (6.5%). However, septic complications in the
      surgical field were only 7 (1.6%). A 83-year-old patient died after surgery
      because of heart failure. The risk of post-operative complications was
      significantly higher in patients with elevate Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI).
      We treated patients with malnutrition pre-operatively using parenteral nutrition 
      (TPN). In 100 patients undergoing TPN we observed a significant PNI reduction
      (from 53.3 +/- 13 to 42.1 +/- 6.9) and a significative improvement of transport
      proteins correlated with nutritional status, such as pre-albumin (from 21.2 mg/dl
      +/- 9.8 to 26.5 mg/dl +/- 7.8) and retinol binding protein (from 3.8 mg/dl +/-
      1.6 to 4.6 mg/dl +/- 1.7). During surgical operations we recorded fistulas caused
      by disease, observing 336 fistulas in 258 patients. The treatment of fistulas (by
      suture or less frequently by resection of the intestinal tract involved in the
      inflammatory process) prevented septic post-operative complications: indeed we
      did not observe enteric fistulas in any patient post-operatively. We conclude
      that the improvement of nutritional status and the adequate treatment of enteric 
      fistulas prevents septic complications in nearly all patients.

TI  - Controlled trial of oligopeptide versus amino acid diet in treatment of active
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Elemental diets are effective in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease,
      but how they exert this therapeutic effect is unclear. In a previous study a
      whole protein containing diet proved less effective than one in which food
      antigens were excluded, suggesting that exclusion of food antigens from the gut
      was a possible mechanism. This study was designed to test whether an oligopeptide
      diet of hydrolysed proteins was as effective as an amino acid based diet. These
      diets were equally antigen free but with different nitrogen sources. Forty four
      patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised in a controlled trial of
      amino acid versus oligopeptide diet. The feeds were given by nasogastric tube in 
      equicaloric quantities and were the sole form of nutrition. Treatment was
      continued for four weeks although failure to improve by day 10 resulted in
      withdrawal. Quantitative leucocyte scintigraphy was used to investigate the
      effect of diet treatment on gut inflammation. Clinical and nutritional responses 
      to treatment were also measured. Sixteen patients entered remission (including
      withdrawal of corticosteroids), six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric
      tube, and 22 patients failed to respond. The two diets were equally effective.
      Patients who responded had a rapid drop in clinical index of disease activity and
      a major reduction in the bowel uptake of leucocytes on scintigraphy. The
      oligopeptide and amino acid based enteral feeds were equally effective at
      inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. With both diets clinical
      improvement was accompanied by a reduction in intestinal inflammation.

      disease--including comparison between Elental and Enterued].
PG  - 32-40
AB  - Therapeutic efficacy of Elental and Enterued as home enteral nutrition (HEN) for 
      the maintenance of remission in 32 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease was
      studied retrospectively. Their cumulative rates of continuous remission and non
      hospitalization were statistically compared in relation to following five
      factors; type of disease, history of bowel resection, duration of disease, oral
      bile acid tolerance test (OBATT) and radiological lesion score (RLS). As to the
      cumulative rates of continuous remission and non hospitalization, there was no
      significant difference between two groups treated with Elental and Enterued. In
      patient with ileocolitis type, > or = 5-year history, and a high score of RLS,
      few cases could continuously maintain remission following a long-term HEN.
      Especially, patients with low absorption in OBATT had a significantly lower
      cumulative rate of continuous remission than those with normal absorption in
      OBATT. The present results suggest that above factors may be useful in the
      application of HEN to patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Remission following an elemental diet or prednisolone in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - The short- and long-term effects of an elemental diet in children with acute
      Crohn's disease were compared with those of prednisolone in historical controls. 
      Clinical remission was induced in 25 of 30 and in 18 of 28 episodes treated for
      six weeks with an elemental diet and prednisolone. Patients with proximal disease
      had longer remission after treatment with an elemental diet (p < 0.05) than did
      patients with colonic disease after treatment with prednisolone (p < 0.01).
      Disease activity index score improved in both groups compared with the
      pretreatment scores (p < 0.05). However, the improvement in the elemental diet
      group was significantly better than in the prednisolone group (p < 0.001).
      Changes in linear growth were better after treatment with an elemental diet
      compared with steroids (p < 0.001). Serum albumin and haematocrit concentrations 
      all improved significantly in the children treated with an elemental diet (p <
      0.001) but not in those treated with steroids. Thus an elemental diet was better 
      than prednisolone in proximal disease and confirmed improved growth and
      nutritional status.

      Crohn's disease with elemental diet.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which elemental diets induce remission in patients 
      with Crohn's disease is unknown, but it has been suggested that improvement in
      nutritional state may play a part. METHODS: We assessed sequential changes in
      disease activity (clinical and laboratory indices and faecal excretion of
      indium-111-labelled leucocytes) and nutritional status (anthropometry, body
      composition variables), hepatic secretory proteins (albumin, pre-albumin,
      transferrin), and trace elements (iron, magnesium, copper, zinc) during treatment
      of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet. RESULTS: Disease activity
      indices improved significantly by 2 weeks and were maintained at 4 weeks of
      treatment. There was a significant increase in pre-albumin at 4 weeks and an
      increase in serum iron and a decrease in serum copper during the study period.
      The changes occurring in the measures of nutrition did not correlate
      significantly with the changes in disease activity. CONCLUSION: The fact that
      changes in disease activity appear to precede any detectable changes in
      nutritional state, it suggests that the beneficial action of elemental diet in
      patients with active Crohn's disease is not due to an improvement in nutritional 
      status.

TI  - Dietary vitamin D intake in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 578-81
AB  - In search for the reasons of vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease (CD),
      dietary records were evaluated over 7 days in 30 uninformed out-patients with CD 
      (but no current flare-up) by the help of food tables and compared with those of
      30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The study was undertaken in December.
      The nutritional status (height-weight index) was similar in both groups. The
      dietary vitamin D intake was as low in patient with CD (1.0 microgram/d; 0.5-1.3)
      as in the controls (1.1; 0.4-1.6) whereas the recommended daily intake is 5
      micrograms/d. Vitamin D intake correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD)
      levels in patients with low 25-OHD levels (tau = 0.45, p = 0.04). Bone mineral
      content (BMC)-measured by single photon absorptiometry on the radius- was
      decreased in 9 patients (31%) with CD. Patients with CD tended to have a lower
      sun exposure in summer (p = 0.10), which also correlated with BMC (p = 0.03).
      Hence, a specific diet with a high vitamin D content, or vitamin D
      supplementation is recommended in patients with CD to overcome the negative
      effects of low sun exposure on bone mineral density.
