TI  - A comprehensive approach to evaluate nutritional status in Crohn's patients in
      the era of biologic therapy: a case-control study.
PG  - 2551-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the nutritional status of patients with inactive or mildly
      active Crohn's disease (CD), and identify possible causes for potential
      deficiencies. METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were
      evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles
      factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies.
      Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P=
      0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8%
      and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free
      mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was 
      decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD
      patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily
      intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D,
      E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet,
      28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a
      significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the
      exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E
      (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01)
      and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat
      mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most
      prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which
      was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly
      related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.

TI  - An initial report of sleep disturbance in inactive inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 409-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, peptic
      ulcer disease, and colon cancer in night-shiftworkers, whose sleep is commonly
      disrupted. Sleep complaints are an extrapyramidal symptom of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Sleep disruption may contribute to increased medical morbidity by
      weakening the ability of the immune system to protect against endotoxins-this
      pathway could be of potential importance to the pathogenesis and/or clinical
      course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic immunoinflammatory
      gastrointestinal disorder associated with marked reductions in quality of life.
      This is the first study to comprehensively examine sleep concerns in patients
      with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with biopsy-proven inactive IBD (8 with Crohn
      disease and 8 with ulcerative colitis), 9 patients with IBS, and 7 healthy
      controls completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-12, and a single overnight
      polysomnogram. Polysomnography and arousals were scored according to standard
      criteria. Multivariate analyses were used to compare subjective and objective
      sleep parameters between groups and to identify associations between sleep
      complaints and quality of life. RESULTS: Patients with IBD did not seem to
      significantly differ from patients with IBS, who have established sleep
      complaints. On polysomnography, total sleep time differentiated the 3 groups
      well, with the IBS and IBD groups appearing numerically similar. Whereas IBS and 
      IBD groups were similar with respect to observed sleep parameters, IBS patients
      did report the most concerns, consistent with earlier research suggesting that
      hyperarousal and perceptual differences may contribute to symptom reporting.
      CONCLUSION: Sleep parameters greatly influenced quality of life in both groups
      and highlight the need to address sleep concerns as part of IBD management.

TI  - Protein-losing enteropathy in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 384-9
AB  - Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a rare but severe complication of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and hypoalbuminemia can be one of the presenting symptoms of this
      illness. The diagnosis of PLE can only be made after exclusion of malnutrition
      and liver or kidney failure. Significant intestinal leakage can be caused by
      mucosal injury, increased lymphatic pressure or dilated lymphatics and has been
      reported in a large number of diseases. The protein-losing can be diagnosed by
      assessing the excretion of different radiolabeled macromolecules in the faeces or
      by the clearance of alpha-1-antitrypsine in stools. The primary approach should
      be the optimization of the nutritional status. Medical treatment of the
      underlying disease is primordial. In other cases surgical resection of the most
      affected areas is inevitable. We report a case of a 21-year-old male with a 4
      year history of CD, who developed significant hypoproteinemia with pitting
      oedema, initially in the absence of any other sign of severe disease activity. A 
      "Cr-chloride albumin excretion confirmed our hypothesis of protein-losing
      enteropathy. Because of sub-obstruction signs some months later, a laparotomy was
      performed which revealed a severely affected loop with dilatation of the proximal
      jejunum. Interestingly, multiple large lymph nodes and dilated lymphatics were
      seen. A partial jejunal resection was performed for stricturing Crohn's disease. 
      Histology showed severe mesenteric granulomatosis, dilated lymph vessels and
      granulomatous vasculitis. After the resection our patient improved without
      further albumin infusions and the oedema resolved.

TI  - [Dietary characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 895-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional status and dietary habits of Lithuanian
      patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and to compare with those of
      healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in
      the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A
      total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178
      healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report
      questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in
      primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was
      calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no
      statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning
      consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white 
      bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed 
      fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's 
      disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and
      patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body 
      mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower
      compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower
      body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls.
      Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less 
      frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided
      with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment on plasma antioxidant
      concentrations in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants may play a role
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being 
      used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children 
      with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15
      children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a
      paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a
      standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet
      (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of
      selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also
      malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive
      enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of
      the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14
      micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in
      mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7),
      P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}.
      The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change
      significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any
      significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
      changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with
      active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine
      supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.

TI  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody does not differentiate between Crohn's
      disease and intestinal tuberculosis.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - The clinical, morphological, and histological features of intestinal tuberculosis
      (IT) and Crohn's disease (CD) mimic so much, that it becomes difficult to
      differentiate between them. The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is
      almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it
      ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC;
      n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this
      study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified 
      Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum 
      was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated
      using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany).
      Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect
      immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and
      ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and
      patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was
      positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT,
      respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, 
      UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher
      number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy 
      controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with
      UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In
      comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more
      patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no
      significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs.
      46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was
      no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We
      conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and
      CD.

TI  - Characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease with onset during the first year of
      life.
PG  - 603-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is recognized in young children,
      however, only rare data on onset and evolution are available in children younger 
      than 1 year. In the present clinical study, we aimed to analyze characteristics
      and clinical course of children with very early onset IBD. We were particularly
      interested in the relationship between bacterial infections and the use of
      antibiotics before the onset of IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IBD database of
      Necker-Enfants-Malades-Hospital was screened for patients with IBD with disease
      onset during the first year of life and a follow-up of at least 2.5 years. Ten
      patients were identified during the period 1996-2002. RESULTS: All patients
      presented with rectal bleeding and had colonic involvement. Four patients had
      definitive diagnosis of Crohn disease; ulcerative or indeterminate colitis was
      seen in 2 and 4 children, respectively. Five of the patients had a positive
      history of neonatal or early-onset bacterial infection with use of antibiotics
      before onset of IBD, 4 patients were still breastfed and 3 just weaned when GI
      symptoms started. Seven patients had a severe onset of disease requiring bowel
      rest, parenteral nutrition and steroid medication, followed by azathioprine or
      cyclosporine medication. Surgery was necessary in 3 of 10 patients. Disease
      relapses were frequent and observed in 8 of 10 children. DISCUSSION: Very early
      onset IBD may reflect a subgroup of patients characterized by a particular
      sensitivity to modifications of the intestinal flora. Neonatal IBD was most often
      severe in presentation and evolution.

TI  - The prevalence of long bone fractures in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 597-602
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with decreased 
      bone mineral density is well recognized. In the adult population, up to 50% of
      IBD patients are reported to have osteopenia, correlating with an increase in the
      incidence of fractures as compared with controls. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of fractures in a pediatric population with IBD as
      compared with healthy sibling controls (SC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The families
      of 209 patients with IBD were sent a questionnaire asking them to compare their
      children with IBD to a healthy sibling (non-IBD). RESULTS: Surveys were returned 
      by 132 of the 209 families (63%). The sample characteristics of this sample
      closely resembled the overall clinic population for age (mean 14.3 vs 14.7
      years), gender (53% vs 59% male) and diagnosis (58.1 vs 57.8 Crohn disease).
      Completed surveys described 263 children. Of the 132 with IBD 73 (55%) had Crohn 
      disease, 52 (39%) had ulcerative colitis and 7 (6%) had indeterminate colitis.
      There were 76/132 males (age range, 4-18 years) with IBD and 64/131 males (age
      range, 1-26 years) in the sibling controls. Mean ages of the IBD sample 14.3
      +/-.3 was compared with 13.9 +/- in SC. Of the total group, 73/263 (28%) reported
      ever having a fracture, 44 (60%) were siblings (SC), and 29 (40%) had IBD. Of the
      29 children with IBD, 17 (59%) reported having a fracture after diagnosis
      including 2 who had fractures both before and after diagnosis. The total number
      of fractures reported was 96 (55 SC:41 IBD). CONCLUSION: In this survey, we found
      no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fracture in IBD
      patients compared with their normal siblings.

TI  - Impaired intestinal iron absorption in Crohn's disease correlates with disease
      activity and markers of inflammation.
PG  - 1101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is a common problem of
      multifactorial origin, including blood loss, malabsorption of iron, and anemia of
      inflammation. Anemia of inflammation is caused by the effects of inflammatory
      cytokines [predominantly interleukin-6 (IL-6)] on iron transport in enterocytes
      and macrophages. We sought to elucidate alterations in iron absorption in
      pediatric patients with active and inactive CD. METHODS: Nineteen subjects with
      CD (8 female, 11 male patients) were recruited between April 2003 and June 2004. 
      After an overnight fast, serum iron and hemoglobin levels, serum markers of
      inflammation [IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate], and a urine sample for hepcidin assay were obtained at 8 am. Ferrous
      sulfate (1 mg/kg) was administered orally, followed by determination of serum
      iron concentrations hourly for 4 hours after the ingestion of iron. An area under
      the curve for iron absorption was calculated for each patient data set. RESULTS: 
      There was a strong inverse correlation between the area under the curve and IL-6 
      (P = 0.002) and area under the curve and CRP levels (P = 0.04). Similarly, the
      difference between baseline and 2-hour serum iron level (Delta[Fe]2hr) correlated
      with IL-6 (P = 0.008) and CRP (P = 0.045). When cutoff values for IL-6 (>5 pg/mL)
      and CRP (>1.0 mg/dL) were used, urine hepcidin levels also positively correlated 
      with IL-6 and CRP levels (P = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      Subjects with active CD have impaired oral iron absorption and elevated IL-6
      levels compared with subjects with inactive disease. These findings suggest that 
      oral iron may be of limited benefit to these patients. Future study is needed to 
      define the molecular basis for impaired iron absorption.

TI  - Factors affecting recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease under nutritional
      therapy.
PG  - S68-74
AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective study was designed to determine risk factors for
      recurrence of Crohn's disease under enteral nutrition. METHODS: The clinical
      course of 145 patients with Crohn's disease, who were primarily induced into
      remission by total parenteral nutrition, was reviewed. The patients were
      classified into two groups: enteral nutrition group (n = 98; >/=1,200 kcal/day of
      enteral nutrition), or nonenteral nutrition group (n = 47;<1,200 kcal/day of
      enteral nutrition) according to the amount of their daily elemental or polymeric 
      diet. Contributions of enteral nutrition and other clinical variables to the
      recurrence were analyzed retrospectively. A Crohn's disease activity index of
      >150 plus an increase in Crohn's disease activity index of >70 from the baseline 
      value was defined as recurrence. RESULTS: Forty-two patients in the enteral
      nutrition group and 29 patients in the nonenteral nutrition group recurred during
      periods ranging from 3 to 159 months. The cumulative rate of recurrence was
      significantly higher in the nonenteral nutrition group than in the enteral
      nutrition group (P = 0.047). Among the Crohn's disease patients in the enteral
      nutrition group, penetrating type (relative risk, 3.89; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 1.58-9.62), colonic involvement (relative risk, 3.10; 95 percent
      confidence interval, 1.39-6.9), and previous history of surgery (relative risk,
      2.48; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16-5.33) were factors that significantly 
      affected recurrence. In contrast, penetrating type was the only possible factor
      associated with recurrence in the nonenteral nutrition group (relative risk,
      2.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.96-7.81). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
      with Crohn's disease under maintenance enteral nutrition, the risk of recurrence 
      differs according to the disease type and the site of involvement. The
      maintenance treatment by enteral nutrition alone seems insufficient for patients 
      with penetrating type or with colonic involvement.

TI  - Vitamin B12 malabsorption in patients with limited ileal resection.
PG  - 1210-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with Crohn's disease who have terminal ileal resections are 
      at risk for vitamin B12 malabsorption. Our aim was to determine whether the
      length of terminal ileum resected correlated with an abnormal Schilling test
      result. METHODS: Patients with a history of ileal resection had the length of
      small bowel removed determined by review of their pathology report. Patients who 
      had a Schilling test within 3 mo of surgery or who had a documented normal
      terminal ileum at the time of the Schilling test were included in the study.
      RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included in the study. Patients who had <20 cm
      of terminal ileum resected (n = 14) did not develop abnormal Schilling test
      results; 52% of the remainder (n = 42) had abnormal Schilling test results and
      there was no clear correlation between resection length and abnormal Schilling
      test result. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Crohn's disease and terminal ileal
      resections <20 cm are not at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency. For
      patients with resections of 20-60 cm, options include doing a Schilling test and 
      treating those with abnormal results, empirically treating patients on the
      presumption that they are at high risk of developing deficiency, or monitoring
      for biochemical evidence of deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine
      whether oral supplementation is effective in these patients.

TI  - Vitamin D status in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1950-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies of vitamin D status in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease have revealed conflicting results. We sought to report
      (1) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D
      concentration < or = 15 ng/mL) in a large population with inflammatory bowel
      disease, (2) factors predisposing to this problem, and (3) its relationship to
      bone health and serum parathyroid hormone concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 130 patients (8-22 years of age) with inflammatory bowel disease, 94
      with Crohn disease and 36 with ulcerative colitis, had serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin
      D, intact parathyroid hormone, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (using
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) measured at Children's Hospital Boston.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 34.6%. Mean serum
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was similar in patients with Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis, 52.6% lower among patients with dark skin complexion, 33.4%
      lower during the winter months (December 22 to March 21), and 31.5% higher among 
      patients who were taking vitamin D supplements. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D
      concentration was positively correlated with weight and BMI z score, disease
      duration, and serum albumin concentration and negatively correlated with
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with Crohn disease and upper
      gastrointestinal tract involvement were more likely to be vitamin D deficient
      than those without it. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin concentration was not associated 
      with lumbar spine bone mineral density z score or serum parathyroid hormone
      concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among
      pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Factors predisposing to the
      problem include having a dark-skin complexion, winter season, lack of vitamin D
      supplementation, early stage of disease, more severe disease, and upper
      gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Crohn disease. The long-term 
      significance of hypovitaminosis D for this population is unknown at present and
      merits additional study.

TI  - Low intestinal glutamine level and low glutaminase activity in Crohn's disease: a
      rational for glutamine supplementation?
PG  - 2170-9
AB  - Intestinal glutamine utilization is integral to mucosal regeneration. We analyzed
      the systemic and intestinal glutamine status in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      evaluated the therapeutic effect of glutamine supplementation in an animal model 
      of ileitis. In CD, glutamine concentrations were decreased systemically and in
      noninflamed and inflamed ileal/colonic mucosa. Mucosal glutaminase activities
      were depressed in the ileum independent of inflammation but were not different
      from controls in the colon. In experimental ileitis, oral glutamine feeding
      prevented macroscopic inflammation, enhanced ileal and colonic glutaminase
      activities above controls, and normalized the intestinal glutathione redox
      status. However, glutamine supplementation enhanced myeloperoxidase activity
      along the gastrointestinal tract and potentiated lipid peroxidation in the colon.
      In conclusion, glutamine metabolism is impaired in CD. In experimental ileitis,
      glutamine supplementation prevents inflammatory tissue damage. In the colon,
      however, which does not use glutamine as its principal energy source, immune
      enhancement of inflammatory cells by glutamine increases oxidative tissue injury.

TI  - Efficacy of methotrexate in pediatric Crohn's disease: a French multicenter
      study.
PG  - 1053-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressors play a major role in maintaining remission in
      Crohn's disease (CD). In patients who do not tolerate or escape therapy with
      azathioprine (AZA)/6-mercaptopurine, there is a marked need for other
      immunosuppressive drugs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of methotrexate (MTX) in children with active CD. METHODS: In
      a retrospective multicenter (n = 3) study, the efficacy of MTX to induce complete
      remission or a clinical improvement was analyzed in 61 children with active CD.
      RESULTS: CD was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 +/- 2.3 years, and MTX was
      introduced 3.1 +/- 2.2 years after diagnosis. Indications to use MTX were a
      nonresponse to or relapse under AZA (n = 42) or AZA intolerance/toxicity (n =
      19). MTX improved or induced complete remission in 49 patients (80%), of whom 18 
      (29.5%) relapsed after 13 +/- 10 months of treatment. Under MTX medication,
      complete remission was observed in 39%, 49%, and 45% at 3, 6, and 12 months,
      respectively. Follow-up over at least 24 months in 11 children confirmed a
      sustained remission on MTX monotherapy up to 40 months. Adverse reactions were
      observed in 14 patients (24%), requiring discontinuation of MTX in 6 children
      (10%) (liver enzyme elevation, n = 2; varicella-zoster, n = 1; nausea, n = 3).
      MTX allowed corticosteroid discontinuation in 36 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MTX
      improved the clinical course in most pediatric CD patients who escaped or did not
      tolerate AZA. Short-time toxicity of MTX resulted in drug discontinuation in
      <10%. These data point to a beneficial and safe use of MTX in the treatment of
      pediatric CD.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies IL23R as an inflammatory bowel disease
      gene.
PG  - 1461-3
AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to
      these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly 
      significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 
      1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln)
      confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R
      variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R
      associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or
      ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory
      role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Effectiveness of an 'half elemental diet' as maintenance therapy for Crohn's
      disease: A randomized-controlled trial.
PG  - 1333-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although thiopurines have a proven role in maintenance therapy for
      Crohn's disease, an alternative therapy is needed for patients intolerant or
      resistant to thiopurines. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral
      nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie
      requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free
      diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'.
      METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were 
      randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n
      = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse
      over the 2-year period. RESULTS: The relapse rate in the half elemental diet
      group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40
      (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of
      11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred 
      in any of the patients throughout the study. CONCLUSION: This
      randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet,
      which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.

TI  - Current therapy of inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 279-302
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal
      inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
      malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However,
      there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that
      are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during
      childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays
      in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the
      changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from
      school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring
      for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic
      therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed
      surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease
      and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This
      article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD
      and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The
      principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC 
      are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), 
      and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the
      induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse
      include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with
      creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of 
      care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved
      quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using
      increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case
      against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or
      potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management
      of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g.
      gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the
      disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. 
      Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics
      (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric
      formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for
      corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates,
      mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as
      maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is
      typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease
      limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum)
      or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or
      abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications
      administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD
      are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, 
      iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In
      addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of
      developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance
      program after 8-10 years of disease duration.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids as adjunctive therapy in Crohns disease.
PG  - 295-301; quiz 302-3
AB  - Crohns disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can have a significant
      impact on the health of those afflicted. The etiology of the disease is unknown, 
      but genetic, environmental, dietary, and immunological factors are thought to be 
      involved. Multiple nutrients can become depleted during active disease due to
      inadequate intake or malabsorption. Preventing these deficiencies is paramount in
      the care of those suffering from Crohns disease. Often the traditional treatments
      (medications) have limited effectiveness and negative side effects that inhibit
      their use. Enteral nutrition has promising therapeutic benefits, but its use is
      often limited to the pediatric population due to poor patient acceptability.
      Omega-3 fatty acids have been investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties
      as an alternative to traditional care. This article reviews the etiology of
      Crohns disease, nutritional deficiencies, traditional treatments, and the use of 
      omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of Crohns recurrence. The results from
      clinical trials have been conflicting, but a new fish oil preparation that limits
      the side effects of traditional fish oil therapy shows promise as an adjunctive
      treatment for Crohns disease. Continued research is needed to validate these
      findings.

TI  - Sources and severity of self-reported food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis.
PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Data on food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are scarce. The aim
      of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the
      nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and
      Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31%
      men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more
      foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea
      (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy
      foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool
      consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions,
      cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The
      urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than
      after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool
      consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates
      that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base
      their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-)
      physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.

TI  - NODs in defence: from vulnerable antimicrobial peptides to chronic inflammation.
PG  - 432-8
AB  - Defensins and cathelicidins are prevalent and essential gastrointestinal cationic
      antimicrobial peptides (CAPs). However, these defensive peptides are not
      infallible because certain enteropathogens can overcome their protective
      function. Furthermore, impaired defensin synthesis has been linked to the
      occurrence of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
      Recently, defective bacterial sensing through NOD1 and NOD2 has been related to
      reduced defensin production, CD predisposition and susceptibility to enteric
      infection. Hence, we propose that microbial sensors at the gut interface monitor 
      the levels of these effector peptides, which might function as "danger" signals
      to confer tolerance and alert immunocytes. Further work is required to clarify
      how gastrointestinal CAPs are regulated and to assess their role in maintaining
      epithelial homeostasis and triggering adaptive immunity.

TI  - Conventional therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 4794-806
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder of unknown cause. Outstanding
      progress regarding the pathophysiology of CD has led to the development of
      innovative therapeutic concepts. Numerous controlled trials have been performed
      in CD over the last years. However, many drugs have not been approved by
      regulatory authorities due to lack of efficacy or severe side effects. Therefore,
      well-known drugs, including 5-ASA, systemic or topical corticosteroids, and
      immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, are still the mainstay of CD therapy.
      Importantly, biologicals such as infliximab have shown to be efficacious in
      problematic settings such as fistulizing or steroid-dependent CD. This review is 
      intended to give practical guidelines to clinicians for the conventional
      treatment of CD. We concentrated on the results of randomized, placebo-controlled
      trials and meta-analyses, when available, that provide the highest degree of
      evidence. We provide evidence-based treatment algorithms whenever possible.
      However, many clinical situations have not been answered by controlled clinical
      trials and it is important to fill these gaps through expert opinions. We hope
      that this review offers a useful tool for clinicians in the challenging treatment
      of CD.

TI  - Malabsorption is a major contributor to underweight in Crohn's disease patients
      in remission.
PG  - 855-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Undernutrition has been reported in 65-75% of patients with Crohn's
      disease. The present study aimed at identifying the relative contribution of
      malnutrition-causing factors in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.
      METHODS: Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease (age 19-57 y) in remission
      (Crohn's Activity Disease Index < 150) were included in the study. Their weight
      was stable for >3 mo and they were off steroids. They all completed 3-d food
      records and concomitantly collected stools. Self-reported food records were
      analyzed and energy content in stools was determined by a direct bomb
      calorimeter. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied by indirect calorimetry
      and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study cohort was
      divided into two groups, with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 18.5 kg/m(2)
      serving as a cutoff point. RESULTS: Subjects with lower BMIs tended to have less 
      lean body mass (P = 0.006), less bone mineral density (P = 0.006), and lower REE 
      (P = 0.003). No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake but the
      percentage of malabsorption was negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.07). When
      dividing the study based on a BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2), no difference was found in
      caloric intake or REE between groups but subjects with lower BMIs had significant
      prominent malabsorption compared with the others (21.1 +/- 9.8% versus 11.7 +/-
      3.5%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: In the presence of similar energy intake, REE does 
      not seem to contribute to lower BMI, although nutrient malabsorption is higher in
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We suggest that
      malabsorption be evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease who fail to gain
      weight during disease remission to establish their extra caloric requirements.

TI  - Exclusive enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn's disease in Australian
      children and adolescents: a feasible and effective approach.
PG  - 1609-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral feeding has been shown to be as efficacious as
      corticosteroids in inducing remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD), with
      additional nutritional benefits. The use of polymeric formulae provides superior 
      palatability and acceptance over elemental feeds, but polymeric formulae have not
      been universally adopted. The present retrospective analysis of enteral feeding
      in children with Crohn's disease aims to demonstrate the short-term benefits of
      enteral feeding in children upon disease activity and nutrition parameters.
      METHODS: The case records of children with CD managed with exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN) by a multidisciplinary team over a 2-year period were reviewed.
      Data relating to therapy, background disease details, and outcome were collated. 
      Primary outcome measures established were weight change and disease activity
      (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index: PCDAI). RESULTS: Twenty-seven children
      received EEN with polymeric formulae. Fifteen children had newly diagnosed CD and
      12 had known long-standing CD. Twenty-four children completed the prescribed
      period of EEN. Twelve of 15 (80%) newly diagnosed CD and seven of 12 (58%) with
      long-standing disease entered remission. Children with newly diagnosed CD
      responding to EEN took all feeds orally and gained an average of 4.7+/-3.5 kg
      with mean PCDAI decreasing from 37.1+/-10.8 to 6.7+/-5.1 after 8 weeks. In
      addition, four children continued supplementary polymeric formula (without other 
      medical therapies) and all have maintained remission during an average follow-up 
      period of 15.2 months. CONCLUSION: Exclusive enteral feeds induced remission in
      80% of children with newly diagnosed CD (on intention-to-treat basis) when used
      as sole initial therapy while also improving nutritional status. All newly
      diagnosed children treated with EEN, who were able to establish feeds, achieved
      remission. In addition, remission may be prolonged with oral supplementary
      formula as sole ongoing treatment. Further study of the role(s) of enteral feeds 
      and of longer-term benefits of enteral feeding in children with CD is now
      required.

TI  - Distinct phenotype of early childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 583-6
AB  - GOALS: Our goals were to answer 2 questions: (1) Is the presentation of
      early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) similar to typical adolescent-onset 
      IBD? (2) Is there variability in familial aggregation in childhood IBD?
      BACKGROUND: The phenotype of IBD in children under 5 years of age (early-onset)
      is poorly defined. Clinical and genetic studies of IBD, however, generally assume
      the phenotype to be homogenous throughout childhood. STUDY: We analyzed data from
      413 consecutive pediatric IBD outpatients attending our center between 1995 and
      2000. Disease type, anatomic distribution, and family history were compared
      between children presenting before (early-onset) and after the age of five (5 to 
      15 y). RESULTS: Disease presentation was predominantly colonic in early-onset
      IBD, most patients presenting with ulcerative colitis (UC). Isolated colonic
      disease was most frequent in early-onset Crohn disease (colonic 76.5%, ileocolic 
      24%) compared with ileocolic disease (ileocolic 45.5%, colonic 26%, ileal 19.4%, 
      proximal 6.3%) in the older age group. First-degree family history was highest in
      early-onset UC 26% versus 11% in the older UC group. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a
      distinct phenotype of early childhood onset IBD, with a strikingly high familial 
      aggregation in UC and greater tendency to present with colonic disease. As more
      genetic heterogeneity is identified in IBD, careful definition of phenotype is
      required to identify further susceptibility genes. The early-onset form of UC
      presents an ideal group for further genetic analysis. These phenotype differences
      also suggest that treatment and outcome may vary in early-onset childhood IBD;
      prospective studies are required to confirm this.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in the first year after a diagnosis of pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 684-91
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is of
      increasing importance in the evaluation of new therapies for inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Available data concerning HRQOL in pediatric patients are sparse
      and uniformly cross-sectional. The aim of this study was to describe HRQOL and
      influential factors in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis during the first 12 months after diagnosis. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Participants were drawn from a large, prospectively derived
      observational IBD registry of pediatric patients studied through 18 U.S. and
      Canadian centers. Patients who had completed a baseline IMPACT questionnaire and 
      for whom there were 12 months of follow-up data available were included. In
      addition to description of cohort, factors that were believed to influence HLQOL 
      were assessed during the course of the year from diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      eighteen children met inclusion criteria (77% Crohn's disease, 23 % ulcerative
      colitis, mean age 12.7 +/- 1.9 years). Mean total IMPACT score at baseline was
      154, 181 at 6 months, and 191 at 1 year (possible range 0-238, with increasing
      scores representing better quality of life). Repeated measures analysis showed
      that age and disease severity significantly negatively affected the IMPACT scores
      during the course of the year. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective pediatric
      IBD cohort, significant improvement in HRQOL is noted during the year from
      diagnosis. Mean IMPACT scores varied significantly depending on the disease
      severity and also decreased with increasing age.

TI  - Transplantation of an eight-organ multivisceral graft in a patient with frozen
      abdomen after complicated Crohn's disease.
PG  - 4431-4
AB  - To report an extended multivisceral transplantation (MVTx) including right kidney
      and ascending colon in a patient with complicated Crohn's disease (CD). A 36-year
      old female suffering from short bowel syndrome and frozen abdomen due to
      fistulizing CD after multiple abdominal operations underwent MVTx of eight organs
      including stomach, pancreatoduodenal complex, liver, intestine, ascending colon, 
      right kidney, right adrenal gland, and greater omentum in November 2003.
      Immunosuppression consisted of alemtuzumab, tacrolimus and steroids. The patient 
      was off parenteral nutrition by postoperative wk 3. She experienced one episode
      of pneumonia. The patient recovered completely and discharged 2.5 mo and was
      doing well 30 mo after MVTx. This is one of the very rare cases in which a
      complete mulitivisceral graft of eight abdominal organs was transplanted
      orthotopically.

TI  - Diagnostic yield, safety, and efficacy of push enteroscopy in pediatrics.
PG  - 224-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Push enteroscopy has not been compared to standard endoscopy in
      children. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of
      push enteroscopy in children with suspected proximal small bowel disease, and to 
      compare its diagnostic yield and safety with standard endoscopy. DESIGN/SETTING: 
      Database review. PATIENTS: A database analysis was performed on all children who 
      underwent push enteroscopy at The Johns Hopkins Children's Center from 2001 to
      2005. Patient demographics, clinical history, and indication for push enteroscopy
      were all recorded. Clinical utility was qualified based on the influence of PE on
      therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic yield and safety of push
      enteroscopy in children. RESULTS: Push enteroscopy was performed on 44 children
      (27 M; 17 F) with a median age (range) of 10 (2-18) years. The most common
      indications for push enteroscopy were suspected proximal small bowel disease
      based on radiological criteria (21), and bleeding (9). Push enteroscopy confirmed
      the diagnosis of proximal small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) in 23, polyps in 5,
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis in 4, celiac disease in 1, microvillous inclusion
      disease in 1, and lymphoproliferative disease in 1 patient. An isolated
      non-Crohn's related gastric (1) and jejunal ulcer (1) was also identified. Just 9
      of these identifiable lesions were within reach by esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      (EGD). Seven patients had a normal push enteroscopy. The clinical management was 
      modified in 34 patients. Push enteroscopy was not shown to significantly alter
      the time of procedure when compared to EGD. CONCLUSIONS: Push enteroscopy is a
      safe diagnostic tool with proven clinical utility in children with suspected
      proximal small bowel disease. Larger studies are needed to establish the
      widespread application of push enteroscopy in pediatrics.

TI  - Infliximab treatment of pediatric refractory Crohn's disease: a case report.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-alpha and has been shown to 
      be effective for the management of steroid-dependent or refractory Crohn's
      disease. It is an effective therapy in adult patients, but experience in children
      is limited. We report a case of Crohn's disease which was refractory to the
      conventional treatment. A 14-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with
      arthralgia and oral and perianal lesions. On physical examination his body weight
      was below the 3rd percentile, and height was between the 3rd-10th percentiles. He
      had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein and decreased 
      hemoglobin, hematocrit and albumin levels. Barium enema and computerized
      abdominal tomography revealed a markedly distended small bowel with a narrowed
      area just above the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum. There was no mucosal
      pathology in his colonoscopic study. A regimen of prednisolone was begun with a
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease. In the first month of therapy the patient
      experienced progressive worsening of his symptoms, and azathioprine was added to 
      the treatment in the second month. As he had exacerbation of his symptoms and
      worsening laboratory tests, infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg/d) were administered
      intravenously (at 0, 2 and 6 weeks) at the end of the 8th week. At the 6th week
      of treatment including two infusions of infliximab at 0 and 2 weeks, clinical and
      laboratory response occurred. The only side effect of the treatment was
      pneumonia, which was seen after the 6th week of the therapy. In conclusion,
      infliximab appears to be an effective and safe therapy for childhood refractory
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus as a cause of liver abscess in a NOD2/CARD15-positive
      patient with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of a fistula and/or an abscess are major
      complications in patients with Crohn's disease. An abscess can involve any of the
      major viscera, including the liver and spleen. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old male
      patient with a 6-month history of NOD2/CARD15-positive Crohn's disease with
      stenosis of the terminal ileum, previously treated with corticosteroids, was
      admitted with fever, chills, diarrhea, fatigue and cachexia. Diagnostic work-up
      revealed sepsis, an abscess in the right hepatic lobe, multiple abdominal
      collections and right-sided pleural effusion. It was felt that his poor general
      condition prevented surgical intervention and complex conservative treatment was 
      initiated. It consisted of total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, percutaneous 
      drainage of the liver abscess, and thoracocentesis. Pus and blood cultures showed
      Lactobacillus acidophilus. There was a gradual improvement in the patient's
      condition and the liver abscess decreased in diameter from 14 to 2 cm.
      Aminosalicylates and enteral nutrition were gradually introduced. The patient was
      discharged after 9 weeks in good general condition. CONCLUSION: Although
      extremely rarely, L. acidophilus can cause hepatic abscess and sepsis. This can
      be explained by immunologic incompetence due to corticosteroid treatment of
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Malnutrition affects quality of life in gastroenterology patients.
PG  - 3380-5
AB  - AIM: To investigate the association between malnutrition and quality of life in
      patients with benign gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: Two hundred patients (104
      wellnourished and 96 malnourished) were assessed according to the Subjective
      Global Assessment, anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance
      analysis. Quality of life was determined with the validated Medical Outcomes
      Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF 36). Muscle function was
      assessed by hand grip strength and peak flow. RESULTS: Body mass index, body cell
      mass, arm muscle area and hand grip strength were significantly lower in the
      malnourished patients. Quality of life was generally lower when compared to norm 
      values. Seven out of eight quality of life scales (excluding bodily pain) were
      significantly reduced in the malnourished patients. Comparing patients with liver
      cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), patients with IBD experienced
      significantly lower values in the perception of bodily pain,social functioning
      and mental health. Malnourished liver cirrhotics suffered reductions in more
      scales (six out of eight) than malnourished IBD patients did (four out of eight).
      CONCLUSION: Quality of life is generally low in benign gastrointestinal disease
      and is further reduced in patients who are classified as malnourished. It appears
      that liver cirrhosis patients experience a higher quality of life than IBD
      patients do, but the impact of malnutrition seems to be greater in liver
      cirrhosis than in IBD.

TI  - Guidelines for the treatment of Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 349-52
AB  - This paper shows guidelines for the treatment of Crohn's disease in children by
      the Working Group of the Japanese Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology and Nutrition (Chair: Yuichiro Yamashiro) and the Japanese Society for
      Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Chair: Akio Kobayashi). The points in which
      these guidelines differ from those for adult patients are as follows. (i) Total
      enteral nutrition in the form of an elemental formula is indicated as primary
      therapy for children with Crohn's disease at onset as well as the active stage.
      Oral mesalazine is used together. (ii) Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with oral
      mesalazine is required for children with serious illness. The use of a
      corticosteroid should be withheld for at least 1 week after TPN has been started.
      (iii) When TPN is not considered to be effective, additional corticosteroid is
      used. Full doses of corticosteroid should be used for at least 2 weeks after
      clinical improvement has been achieved, and then the dose of the corticosteroid
      should be tapered carefully. (iv) When surgery is indicated in pediatric patients
      with stricture or fistula formation and complicated by persistent growth failure 
      despite medical therapy, the optimum time for surgery is thought to be before
      epiphyseal plates have been closed.

TI  - Pregnancy and delivery in patients with enterostomy due to anorectal
      complications from Crohn's disease.
PG  - 313-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Enterostomy is often undergone by patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD) due to severe anorectal lesions such as rectovaginal fistula (RVF). 
      Reports of successful pregnancy and delivery, which are important determinants of
      quality of life for female CD patients with stoma, are limited. Thus, we
      investigated problems associated with pregnancy and delivery in female CD
      patients at our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 2003, five
      female CD patients with enterostoma carried seven pregnancies and delivered eight
      babies in our hospital. For this study, we investigated CD activity, fetal
      growth, stoma complications, and the outcome of delivery in these seven
      pregnancies. RESULTS: Among the five patients, four underwent loop ileostomy and 
      one loop sigmoidostomy for treatment of RVF or severe stricture of the rectum or 
      sigmoid colon. Except for one case, no fertility treatment was done. During
      pregnancy, a flare-up was observed in one patient and was successfully treated
      with corticosteroids. Although home enteral or parenteral nutrition was required 
      in two cases, fetal growth was within the normal range in all pregnancies.
      Preterm delivery occurred in one case with a twin pregnancy. The mean diameter of
      stoma increased during pregnancy (p<0.01), and a mucosal laceration of stoma by
      the edge of an ostomy appliance occurred in one case. All deliveries were safe,
      with six cesarean sections and one transvaginal delivery. After each delivery,
      the stoma returned to pre-pregnancy size. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and delivery in 
      CD patients with stoma is safe and should be encouraged. However, special
      attention to disease activity, nutritional support, and stoma-related
      complications is recommended.

TI  - ESPEN Guidelines on Enteral Nutrition: Gastroenterology.
PG  - 260-74
AB  - Undernutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and short bowel
      syndrome (SBS). The present guideline gives evidence-based recommendations for
      the indication, application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral
      nutritional supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in these patients. It was
      developed in an interdisciplinary consensus-based process in accordance with
      officially accepted standards and is based on all relevant publications since
      1985. ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished
      patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the
      first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults
      mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant
      differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and 
      whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid
      dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the
      adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in
      addition to normal food.

TI  - Intraperitoneal fluid therapy: an alternative to intravenous treatment in a
      patient with limited vascular access.
PG  - 502-4
AB  - We describe a 58-year-old female with Crohn's disease and short bowel syndrome
      after repeated intestinal resections, with only 90 cm of small intestine left.
      She had been dependent on vascular access for total parenteral nutrition for 16
      years. Due to intravascular complications after numerous long-term central venous
      catheters, her vascular accessibility became limited. During the course of a year
      she was fed enterally through a gastrostomy, but required supplementary fluid
      therapy through peripheral venous route. Because of extremely limited venous
      access, we decided to implant an intraperitoneal catheter for administration of
      crystalloid fluid. The first intraperitoneal catheter had to be removed because
      of a postoperative infection, but after antibiotic treatment, a second
      intraperitoneal catheter was implanted without complications, through which the
      patient is now fully provided with crystalloid fluid (Ringer's acetate).
      Abdominal ultrasound examination shows good absorption of the fluid, and for the 
      first time in 16 years the patient does not need intravascular access. We suggest
      that intraperitoneal administration of fluid may be an alternative for patients
      with limited vascular access.

TI  - Clinical aspects of ulcerative colitis in mainland China.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC), is reported to be increasing in incidence and prevalence in
      provinces and cities in mainland China. This article specifically reviews
      clinical features, extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, diagnosis and 
      differential diagnosis, and medical treatment of UC. Compared to patients in
      Western countries, more mild to moderate and left-sided colitis cases were
      observed in a nation-wide study in China. Complications included anal fistula,
      anal abscess, anal fissure, severe bleeding, intestinal perforation, intestinal
      obstruction and colonic carcinoma. The extra-intestinal manifestations were
      arthritis/arthralgia, eye and skin disorders and oral ulcers. The high
      specificity of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody may useful for distinguishing 
      UC from infectious colitis; in addition, serum levels of anti-saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibody may be helpful for distinguishing between UC and CD. Oral
      sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) remain the mainstays for the
      management of mild to moderate UC in China. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive
      agents are also widely used in severe or refractory UC.

TI  - Probiotics for children: use in diarrhea.
PG  - 244-8
AB  - The use of probiotics in diarrheal diseases of children is increasing.
      Probiotics, mostly lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, 
      but also the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, have been tried in many
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, and several
      well-conducted meta-analyses are now available. There is some evidence of
      efficacy in the prevention of community-acquired and nosocomial diarrhea. More
      solid evidence of efficacy is found in the treatment of sporadic, infectious
      diarrhea, where several probiotics, and especially Lactobacillus GG, have been
      found capable of reducing by approximately 1 day the duration of diarrhea,
      shorten the initial phase of watery stools, and reducing hospital stay in
      developed countries. The effect is best documented in viral diarrheas. Although
      there are valid conceptual premises for probiotics to be helpful in inflammatory 
      bowel diseases, only 1 trial has been published in children, showing
      Lactobacillus GG not to be superior to placebo in maintaining remission of Crohn 
      disease. All considered, more research is needed for a better understanding of
      the role of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases of children, addressing
      issues such as pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and role of specific
      probiotics, alone or in combination, in different disorders.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 426-32
AB  - Twenty five per cent of inflammatory bowel disease presents in childhood. Growth 
      and nutrition are key issues in the management with the aim of treatment being to
      induce and then maintain disease remission with minimal side effects. Only 25% of
      Crohn's disease presents with the classic triad of abdominal pain, weight loss,
      and diarrhoea. Most children with ulcerative colitis have blood in the stool at
      presentation. Inflammatory markers are usually although not invariably raised at 
      presentation (particularly in Crohn's disease). Full investigation includes upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy. Treatment requires
      multidisciplinary input as part of a clinical network led by a paediatrician with
      special expertise in the management of the condition.

TI  - Enteral feeding in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 314-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment algorithms for inflammatory bowel disease are
      changing rapidly. Increased and earlier use of immunomodulatory drugs and
      availability of biologic agents have reduced dependence on corticosteroids and
      made mucosal healing a realistic goal. It is timely to debate the role of enteral
      nutrition in this evolving therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease, and to 
      examine the mechanisms of its anti-inflammatory effects in light of current
      understanding of disease pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical studies have
      suggested that response to enteral nutrition is associated with decreased mucosal
      inflammation in Crohn's disease, that isolated Crohn's colitis is less responsive
      and that exclusive enteral nutrition is required. Basic research has demonstrated
      that lipids in the intestinal lumen can alter signalling of the mucosal immune
      system by intestinal epithelial cells. Exclusive enteral nutrition is associated 
      with alteration of enteric microflora. SUMMARY: Enteral nutrition is an
      efficacious treatment of active inflammation involving the ileum; recent-onset
      disease may be particularly responsive. The significance of effects on enteric
      flora deserves further exploration in view of the importance of microbes to
      disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Altered levels of biochemical indices of bone turnover and bone-related vitamins 
      in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1007-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteopenia 
      may be related to pathological rates of bone turnover; however, the literature
      shows mixed results. AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel
      disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32,
      separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and
      controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area,
      respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's
      disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding
      supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific
      alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen
      cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively).
      Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by
      20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%,
      respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the
      combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively
      associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.

TI  - Prior appendectomy and the phenotype and course of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - AIM: To determine whether prior appendectomy modifies the phenotype and severity 
      of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Appendectomy status and smoking habits were
      specified by direct interview in 2838 patients consecutively seen between 1995
      and 2004. Occurrence of complications and therapeutic needs were reviewed
      retrospectively. Additionally, annual disease activity was assessed prospectively
      between 1995 and 2004 in patients who had not had ileocecal resection and of a
      matched control group. RESULTS: Compared to 1770 non-appendectomized patients,
      appendectomized patients more than 5 years before Crohn's disease diagnosis
      (n=716) were more often females, smokers, with ileal disease. Cox regression
      showed that prior appendectomy was positively related to the risk of intestinal
      stricture (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.36;
      P=0.02) and inversely related to the risk of perianal fistulization (adjusted
      hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.83; P=0.002). No
      difference was observed between the two groups regarding the therapeutic needs,
      except for an increased risk of surgery in appendectomized patients, attributable
      to the increased prevalence of ileal disease. Between 1995 and 2004, Crohn's
      disease was active during 50% of years in appendectomized patients (1318 out of
      2637 patient-years) and 51% in non-appendectomized patients (1454 out of 2841
      patient-years; NS). CONCLUSION: Prior appendectomy is associated with a more
      proximal disease and has an increased risk of stricture and a lesser risk of anal
      fistulization. However, the severity of the disease is unaffected.

TI  - Nutritional deficiencies in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are at risk of developing
      nutritional deficiencies, especially because of restrictive diets. The aim of our
      study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in
      nonselected CD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive
      CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in
      clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy
      expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were
      compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old).
      RESULTS: According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not
      malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for
      malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls 
      (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218
      +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No
      significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with
      controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of
      beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P <
      0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc
      (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P 
      < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C
      (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%). CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients in
      remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However,
      micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and
      treatment.

TI  - Intestinal perforation in Crohn's disease. Factors predictive of surgical
      resection.
PG  - 1105-11
AB  - UNLABELLED: New medical therapeutic options challenge the usual surgical
      management of Crohn's disease patients with intestinal perforation. OBJECTIVES:
      To determine factors predictive of surgery for perforation in Crohn's disease and
      define a group of patients that may benefit from non-surgical treatment. METHODS:
      One hundred and sixty-two patients (69 males, 93 females, mean age 39) with
      perforated Crohn's disease (fistula, abscess, inflammatory mass) between January 
      1995 and September 2003 were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: One hundred and
      fifty-one patients (93%) underwent surgery: 70 had planned surgery and 81 had
      surgery for symptomatic deterioration. At two years, the cumulative probability
      of intestinal resection was 0.89 +/- 0.03, and the cumulative probability of
      unplanned intestinal resection was 0.72 +/- 0.05. Predictive factors of unplanned
      surgery were elevated platelet count (adjusted hazard ratio 3.15; 95% CI
      2.21-4.50) and absence of fistula (adjusted hazard ratio 3.14; 95% CI 2.48-3.99).
      The rate of postoperative complications, the need for a stoma, and the length of 
      bowel resection were not significantly different whether the surgery was planned 
      or not. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients with intestinal
      perforation complicating Crohn's disease, particularly those with a fistula,
      might benefit from non-surgical treatment.

TI  - Long-term follow-up of strictureplasty for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 475-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strictureplasty is an effective means of alleviating obstructive
      Crohn's disease while conserving bowel length. The aim of this study was to
      establish long-term outcomes of strictureplasty. METHODS: Between 1978 and 2003, 
      479 strictureplasties were performed in 100 patients during 159 operations.
      Information on Crohn's disease, medical therapy, laboratory indices, surgical
      details, complication rates and outcomes was recorded. The primary endpoint was
      abdominal reoperation. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 85.1 (range 0.2-240.9) months.
      The overall morbidity rate was 22.6 per cent, with septic complications in 11.3
      per cent, obstruction in 4.4 per cent and gastrointestinal haemorrhage in 3.8 per
      cent. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.6 per cent and the procedure-related series
      mortality rate 3.0 per cent. Perioperative parenteral nutrition was the only
      marker for morbidity (P < 0.001). Reoperation rates were 52 per cent at a mean of
      40.2 (range 0.2-205.8) months after a first, 56 per cent at 26.1 (range 3.5-63.5)
      months after a second, 86 per cent at 27.4 (range 1.4-74.5) months after a third,
      and 62.5 per cent at 25.9 (range 7.3-70.5) months following a fourth
      strictureplasty procedure. The major risk factor for reoperation was young age (P
      < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up has confirmed the safety of
      strictureplasty in Crohn's disease. Morbidity is appreciable, although the
      surgical mortality rate is low. Reoperation rates are comparable following first 
      and repeat strictureplasty procedures.

TI  - Determinants of vitamin D status in adult Crohn's disease patients, with
      particular emphasis on supplemental vitamin D use.
PG  - 889-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate determinants (pathophysiologic and physiologic,
      behavioural and lifestyle) of vitamin D status in Irish Crohn's disease (CD)
      patients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Cork City,
      Ireland (52 degrees N). SUBJECTS: Crohn's Disease patients (n=58; mean age 38.1
      years) were recruited from Cork University Hospital. RESULTS: Fifty and nineteen 
      percent of Irish CD patients were vitamin D deficient (defined by serum 25
      hydroxyvitamin (OH) D levels <50 nmol/l) during winter and summer, respectively. 
      Multiple regression analysis showed that summer-time serum 25 (OH) D levels were 
      positively associated with use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.033) and negatively 
      associated with smoking (P=0.006) and being male (P=0.063). During winter-time,
      use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.041) and sun habits (P=0.066) were positively
      associated, whereas small intestinal involvement (P=0.005) and body mass index
      (BMI) (P=0.083) were negatively associated with serum 25 (OH) D levels. There was
      no significant association between other non-pathophysiologic (age, dietary
      calcium or vitamin D) or pathophysiologic factors (steroid use, resection), and
      serum 25 (OH) D levels, at either season. Approximately 41 and 60% of the total
      variation in summer- and winter-time serum 25 (OH) D, respectively, was explained
      by this model. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of Irish CD patents had some level
      of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) during late-wintertime. Use of regular
      low-dose supplemental vitamin D, particularly by patients with small intestinal
      involvement, cessation of smoking and adequate, but responsible, exposure to
      summer sunlight as well as maintaining BMI in the normal range could help
      maintain adequate vitamin D levels during wintertime.

TI  - Utility of serological markers in predicting the early occurrence of
      complications and surgery in pediatric Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many Crohn's disease (CD) patients develop
      complications (fistulae and abscesses), and require surgery, often repeatedly and
      at variable instances. Identifying serological markers that determine their early
      or repeated manifestation can enable implementing more aggressive preventive
      strategies. Our objective was to study the ability of serological markers for
      predicting development of early (first) and recurrent complications or
      requirement for surgery. METHODS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (ASCA) (IgA 
      & IgG) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) were assayed
      close to diagnosis in a pediatric cohort of CD patients identified between 1996
      and 1998. At diagnosis and follow-up, information was acquired on demographic and
      clinical features of disease. Relation between ASCA and clinical events was
      studied using adjusted Cox-proportional hazards modeling. The relative rates of
      recurrent clinical events according to the marker measures were compared.
      RESULTS: The mean age (SD) at diagnosis was 11.2 (3.4) yr. Among 139 patients, 35
      (25.9%) and 31 (22.3%) acquired one or more CD related surgery or complication,
      respectively. Time to occurrence of the first complication was lower among
      patients ASCA+ (IgA or IgG) (hazards ratio (HR) = 2.33; 95% confidence interval
      (CI) = 0.99-5.50) and among those with higher ASCA-IgA titers (HR = 1.20; 95% CI 
      = 1.08-1.34). The rates of recurrent complications were higher among those
      positive or with higher ASCA titers. ASCA did not predict time to undergoing
      surgery independent of complications, and was unrelated to the occurrence of
      recurrent surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that serum ASCA measured close 
      to diagnosis can determine the occurrence of early complications in pediatric CD.
      Preventive treatment targeted toward these susceptible patients could potentially
      modify the disease course.

TI  - Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease is associated with NOD2/CARD15 gene polymorphisms,
      particularly L1007P homozygosity.
PG  - 2316-22
AB  - Limited data exist on the specific association between gastroduodenal Crohn's
      disease (GDCD) and NOD2/CARD15 gene polymorphisms. The aim of this study was to
      assess the association between NOD2 polymorphisms and GDCD, and to assess the
      specific association between each of the 3 major allelic variants G908R, L1007P, 
      and R702W and the clinical features of Crohn's disease. We retrospectively
      reviewed the records of 202 patients with confirmed Crohn's disease and complete 
      data was performed. Seventy-one patients (35%) had at least 1 allelic variant: 55
      had 1 variant, 4 were homozygous for L1007fs, 2 homozygous for R702W, and 10 were
      compound heterozygous. Eighteen patients with confirmed GDCD were identified; 10 
      (56%) had wild type, 4 (22%) had 1 variant, and 4 (22%) had 2 allelic variants (2
      were L1007P homozygous and 2 compound heterozygous). Compared to patients without
      gastroduodenal involvement, those with GDCD were more likely to have 2 allelic
      variants (22% vs. 6%; odds ratio [OR] 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-7.3) 
      and to be homozygous for L1007P (11% vs. 1%; OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.5-9.4). G908R
      heterozygosity was associated with ileal involvement (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-2.9) and
      smoking habits (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-3.8), whereas L1007P homozygosity was
      associated with GDCD (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2.6-10.8). L1007P variation was associated
      with younger age at diagnosis as well. There was no specific association between 
      R702W homo- or heterozygosity and any of the characteristics examined. In
      conclusion, GDCD is associated with double dose of the NOD2/CARD15 gene variants,
      particularly L1007P homozygosity. There is evidence of specific variant-phenotype
      associations. G908R heterozygosity is associated with ileal involvement and
      smoking, whereas L1007P homozygosity is strongly associated with GDCD and younger
      age at diagnosis.

TI  - What is the impact of resistance to activated protein C (Leiden mutation to
      factor V) in inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 705-10
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Resistance to activated protein C (APCR) caused by the
      Leiden mutation to factor V is the most common cause of inherited thrombosis.
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are considered to have an
      increased risk of thromboembolic complications, and the role of APCR as a cause
      has previously been investigated. In this study, we investigated if APCR was
      associated with non-thrombotic morbidities in IBD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Of 951
      patients asked to participate, 389 agreed by returning a signed informed consent 
      and filled questionnaire and took the blood test for APCR. Self-reported
      IBD-related surgery was used as a rough indicator for increased morbidity.
      RESULTS: APCR was present in 6.6% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 10/152)
      and in 12.7% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (30/237). The difference of 6.1%
      is significant (p=0.039). Among patients with CD and APCR, 9 out of 10 had had
      surgery, significantly more than among those without APCR (81/142). In patients
      with UC and APCR, 10 out of 30 had had surgery, still significantly more than in 
      those without APCR (36/207). For the whole group of IBD patients, APCR is
      associated with a significantly increased risk for thrombosis (p=0.0018), and for
      the UC group (8/28) p=0.0029, but not for the CD patients alone (2/9), p=0.2323. 
      No other significant differences could be shown for parameters normally related
      to increased morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: APCR in IBD was associated with an increased
      frequency of IBD-related surgery, which may warrant screening for APCR in
      therapy-resistant IBD. In patients with APCR, it may be more difficult and/or
      important to control inflammation.

TI  - Most probable origin of coeliac disease is low immune globulin A in the intestine
      caused by malfunction of Peyer's patches.
PG  - 757-62
AB  - Coeliac disease frequency increases by obscure reasons and affects in some
      Western countries as much as 1% of the populations. The second one of monozygotic
      twins does not develop the disease in 100% but only in 20-50%. To unravel these
      mysteries, literature was searched to determine the disease background and find
      suggestions for research and prevention. The causal antigen of coeliac disease is
      gluten of wheat that is neutralised in the intestine by secretory immune globulin
      A (sIgA). SIgA is secreted by the secondary (lymphoid) immune system that
      develops in a newborn infant after the primary (central) immune organs thymus and
      bone marrow have been primed with antigens of the intestine. Predisposed infants 
      are sensitive for development of coeliac disease during the time without sIgA
      secretion into the intestine. The risk of the disease diminishes when sIgA cycles
      of gluten neutralisation develop. Peyer's patches (PP) of the secondary immune
      system play a central role in the cycles and possibly do not function well in the
      case of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease in predisposed infants may be prevented 
      by delay of bread consumption till the time of normal sIgA secretion and by
      application of a challenge period with gluten (see Discussion). It is concluded
      that sIgA secretion into body cavities and malfunction of immune cells in PP
      should be included in the future research of coeliac disease as well as in more
      allergic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, asthma, hay fever).

TI  - Predictors of immunomodulator use as early therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - GOALS: The goals of this study were to identify markers in a patient's
      presentation and disease progression that predict the need for the use of
      immunomodulators in a pediatric population. BACKGROUND: Although immunomodulator 
      safety and efficacy have been documented in Crohn's disease, models for
      predicting outcome and the need for immunomodulators (azathioprine,
      6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) early in the disease course have not been
      investigated in children or adults. METHODS: Data on newly diagnosed Crohn's
      disease patients were prospectively collected within 3 weeks of diagnosis, 6
      months after diagnosis, and 1 year after diagnosis. Information collected at each
      visit included medication use and disease activity assessment. RESULTS: A total
      of 57 patients who were followed for > or = 6 months were evaluated. Overall, 34 
      of 57 (59.6%) were started on immunomodulators within 1 year of diagnosis. Mean
      serum albumin (3.35 g/dL vs. 3.7 g/dL, P = 0.013) and hematocrit (33.3% vs.
      35.9%, P = 0.023) at diagnosis were lower, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32
      vs. 12, P = 0.011) at diagnosis was higher in patients who required
      immunomodulators. The total Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score as
      well as the physical examination score and patient recall score within the PCDAI 
      at diagnosis were not different among those who received immunomodulators and
      those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulators are frequently used within 1
      year of diagnosis in pediatric Crohn's disease. Lower serum albumin levels and
      hematocrit, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at diagnosis may predict 
      the need for immunomodulators earlier in the disease course.

TI  - Early and frequent histological recurrence of Crohn's disease in small intestinal
      allografts.
PG  - 1667-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrence of Crohn's disease in small intestinal allografts,
      although rarely described, can cause serious morbidity and jeopardize graft
      survival among transplant recipients with Crohn's disease. However, systematic
      studies to determine the frequency, predictors, and clinical implications of
      recurrent Crohn's disease have not been reported METHODS: We analyzed our
      transplant program's experience with small intestinal allografts in patients with
      Crohn's disease based on retrospective review of clinical and pathological
      records and corresponding pathology slides. RESULTS: Of 67 patients undergoing 70
      transplantations between 1998 and 2004, six adults (three males, three females;
      mean age 48.1 years) had Crohn's disease complicated by short gut syndrome and
      total parenteral nutrition failure. Four survivors surveyed endoscopically for a 
      mean 29 (range, 20-40) months and underwent a mean 37 endoscopic examinations
      with biopsies (range, 31-44) while on maintenance immunosuppression. Despite
      absence of any endoscopic or clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease
      throughout this period, two patients had granulomatous enteritis characteristic
      of Crohn's disease in multiple biopsies, one patient in 8/44 examinations (18%)
      ranging from 34 days to 20 months postoperatively and the other in 6/32
      examinations (19%) ranging from 20 days to 22 months postoperatively. No
      comparable changes occurred in 57 other patients without Crohn's disease followed
      endoscopically under the same protocol CONCLUSIONS: Histological recurrence of
      Crohn's disease may occur in small intestinal allografts despite the absence of
      endoscopic and clinical disease manifestations. Such recurrences are probably not
      rare, may occur as early as 3 weeks after transplantation, and do not necessarily
      portend early clinical recurrence or mandate aggressive therapy to prevent
      allograft loss.

TI  - Managing complicated Crohn's disease in children and adolescents.
PG  - 572-9
AB  - The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by recurrent
      exacerbations. A small, but significant, number of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease are resistant to standard medical therapies. The goal of therapy 
      in pediatric patients is not only to achieve and maintain clinical remission, but
      also to promote growth, development and improve quality of life. All of this
      needs to be achieved within a relatively short window of opportunity, before
      growth and development deficiencies become permanent. The standard therapy for
      pediatric patients with Crohn's disease consists of 5-aminosalicylic-acid
      compounds, antibiotics and enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition has an excellent 
      adverse-effect profile and, in addition to its therapeutic effect, positively
      impacts growth and nutritional status. Immunomodulating medications, such as
      azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, are frequently used to maintain 
      remission, and to treat corticosteroid-dependent and perianal disease. Recently, 
      biologic treatment with the anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha antibody infliximab 
      has dramatically changed the therapeutic approach. The long-term safety of this
      therapy still needs to be established. Limited data are available on other
      biologic therapies, which, at this point in time, are considered experimental and
      are only available through clinical trials.

TI  - Preventive effect of nutritional therapy against postoperative recurrence of
      Crohn disease, with reference to findings determined by intra-operative
      enteroscopy.
PG  - 1431-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the predictive value of
      intra-operative enteroscopy (IOE) and the effect of enteral nutrition (EN) with
      regard to the postoperative recurrence of Crohn disease (CD). MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Forty patients requiring surgery for severe intestinal complications of 
      CD were examined by IOE, and the severity of the remnant small intestine was
      determined. Patients were subclassified into either an EN group (>1,200 kcal/day)
      or a non-EN group (<1,200 kcal/day) according to the amount of daily EN intake
      after surgery. Contributions of IOE findings and EN to postoperative recurrence
      were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: IOE identified intestinal lesions in 39
      patients and active intestinal lesions in 24 patients. The cumulative rate of
      postoperative recurrence was significantly higher in patients with cobblestone
      appearance confirmed by IOE (p=0.006). However, other active intestinal lesions
      were not related to postoperative recurrence. EN reduced the cumulative rate of
      postoperative recurrence (p=0.017), especially in patients with penetrating type 
      (p=0.005), in patients who did not have colitis (p=0.051) and in patients who did
      not have active intestinal lesions confirmed by IOE (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: EN is 
      a prophylactic that prevents the postoperative recurrence of small intestinal CD.
      Patients with the penetrating type of CD, and those who do not have active
      lesions in the small intestine according to IOE, are candidates for EN after
      surgery.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of infliximab on active Crohn's disease under nutritional
      therapy.
PG  - 1423-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this investigation was to elucidate retrospectively the
      therapeutic effect of infliximab in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD)
      under nutritional therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a review of the clinical
      records in 24 nationwide institutions specializing in inflammatory bowel disease,
      the short-term effect of infliximab in 97 patients with active CD was
      retrospectively investigated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) at
      baseline and after 2 weeks of a single infliximab administration (5 mg/kg) was
      compared among patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN group, n=36), those
      following an elemental or polymeric diet (EN group, n=49) and those without TPN
      and EN (NN group, n=12). A decrease in CDAI >or= 70 or a CDAI value <150 at 2
      weeks was regarded as effective. RESULTS: There was no difference in CDAI at
      baseline among the three groups. In each group, CDAI decreased significantly
      (from 250 (195-290) [median (interquartiles)] to 152 (123-233) in the TPN group, 
      p<0.0001; from 259 (200-325) to 180 (130-238) in the EN group, p<0.0001; from 278
      (222-291) to 164 (132-196) in the NN group, p=0.003). Infliximab was effective in
      63.9% of patients in the TPN group, in 55.1% of those in the EN group and in 75% 
      of the NN group. There was no statistical difference in efficacy among the three 
      groups (p=0.4). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed younger age to
      be a significant factor related to the efficacy of infliximab. CONCLUSIONS:
      Infliximab is effective in patients with CD under TPN or EN. Age at infliximab
      administration may be predictive of response to infliximab.

TI  - Anthropometry at the time of diagnosis in Danish children with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1682-3
AB  - UNLABELLED: All patients below 15 y of age living in the eastern part of Denmark 
      with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the period 1998-2000 
      were identified (n=94) and anthropometrical data at the time of diagnosis were
      evaluated. CONCLUSION: The height-for-age and the BMI-for-age, as evaluated by
      z-scores, of children with ulcerative colitis (UC) did not differ from those of
      normal Danish children, but Crohn's disease (CD) children had significantly lower
      height and BMI values, both when compared to normal children and children with
      UC. In contrast to UC, CD is frequently complicated by malnutrition and growth
      retardation at the time of diagnosis.

TI  - Short- and long-term therapeutic efficacy of nutritional therapy and
      corticosteroids in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 381-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative data on the therapeutic efficacy of different enteral
      nutrition formulas and corticosteroids to obtain clinical remission and to induce
      mucosal healing influencing long-term disease course in paediatric Crohn's
      disease are still scarce. AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of nutritional
      therapy using three different formulas versus corticosteroids to achieve clinical
      remission as well as to induce intestinal mucosal healing in active Crohn's
      disease children. Duration of remission and effect on growth recovery were also
      assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological
      data of all new diagnosed active Crohn's disease paediatric cases were
      retrospectively recorded and reviewed. Thirty-seven children (median age 12.1
      years) received nutritional therapy (12 polymeric; 13 semi-elemental; 12
      elemental diet) and 10 subjects (median age 12.4 years) received corticosteroids.
      RESULTS: Similar clinical remission rate were observed after 8 weeks of
      treatment: 86.5% children receiving nutritional therapy versus 90% treated with
      corticosteroids. Improvement in mucosal inflammation occurred in 26 out of 37
      (64.8%) patients on nutritional therapy and in 4 out of 10 (40%) children on
      steroids (p < 0.05). Finally, seven subjects on nutritional therapy and none on
      corticosteroids achieved complete mucosal healing (p < 0.005) at the end of the
      treatment. Nutritional therapy was more effective than corticosteroids in
      improving nutritional status and linear growth recovery. Compared to
      corticosteroids, the duration of clinical remission was longer in the nutritional
      therapy groups without differences among the three different formulas.
      CONCLUSIONS: In children with active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is more
      effective than corticosteroids to improve intestinal inflammation and to maintain
      a more sustained clinical remission.

TI  - Refeeding syndrome in early pregnancy. Case report.
PG  - 803-8
AB  - Refeeding syndrome is a very serious disorder that is not often observed today,
      as it is more common during times of mass starvation or war. Nowadays, it is
      sometimes found in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa or neoplastic
      diseases. A case recently treated in our Intensive Care Unit is described. The
      patient was pregnant and suffering from Crohn's disease. It is emphasized that
      although refeeding syndrome is often fatal if not treated early, it is easily
      prevented or treated with adequate nutritional support.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF binding proteins in active Crohn's
      disease treated with omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids and corticosteroids.
PG  - 1214-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Catabolism and growth impairment are well-known complications of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This may be caused by the disease activity
      itself and/or the medical treatment, and both may lead to changes in the growth
      hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) axis. The aim of the present
      study was to examine the effects of enteral nutrition, Impact Powder, as adjuvant
      therapy to corticosteroid treatment on changes in the GH/IGF-I axis in patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were randomized to 
      3-IP (omega-3-fatty acid (FA), 3 g/day) or 6-IP (omega-6-FA, 9 g/day). Changes in
      total IGF-I (tIGF-I) and total IGF-II (tIGF-II), free IGF-I (fIGF-I), IGF binding
      proteins (IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3), IGFBP-3 protease activity and insulin levels were
      examined in 31 patients with active CD (CDAI: 186-603) during treatment with
      prednisolone (40 mg for 1 week) and tapering the dose by 5 mg/week. Clinical and 
      biochemical markers of inflammation were studied at day 0, and after 5 and 9
      weeks. RESULTS: There were no differences at baseline between the two groups.
      During the treatment period, tIGF-I, fIGF-I and IGFBP-3 increased significantly
      in both groups compared to baseline (p<0.05) without differences between the
      groups. Insulin and IGFBP-1 showed no significant changes throughout the
      treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between 3-IP and 6-IP as
      adjuvant enteral nutrition on the GH/IGF-I axis. The changes observed in the
      GH/IGF-I axis are in line with previously published studies and may be explained 
      by corticosteroid treatment; however, we cannot exclude an additional effect of
      omega3-/omega6 FA as adjuvant enteral nutrition.

TI  - Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis after colectomy in a patient with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 281-5; quiz 1 p following 285
AB  - BACKGROUND: An 18-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease presented in
      January 2004 with severe epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting of 4 hours'
      duration. The patient was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, thought to
      be consistent with ulcerative colitis, in March 2003, but had no medical history 
      up until this point. Initial treatment with mesalamine was unsuccessful and she
      subsequently presented with medically resistant fulminant colitis and required an
      urgent colectomy in June 2003. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful 
      and she was discharged on tapering doses of prednisone. In August 2003, an
      ileoscopy revealed inflamed, mildly ulcerated mucosa, and biopsies were
      consistent with Crohn's disease. Azathioprine was added to the treatment regimen 
      and the patient tapered off prednisone. At this stage the patient continued to do
      well clinically up until presentation. INVESTIGATIONS: Small bowel series,
      abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Acute
      mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. MANAGEMENT:
      Resection of necrotic bowel, antibiotics and systemic anticoagulation.

TI  - [A case of refractory pediatric Crohn's disease with a successful treatment by
      infliximab therapy].
PG  - 297-301
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease which affects mainly
      children and young adults, and its cause remains unknown so far. Infliximab, a
      monoclonal antibody to the pivotal cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, has been
      approved as a drug for both induction and maintenance therapy for moderately to
      severely active, or fistula-complicated Crohn's disease. The authors report a
      12-year-old male patient diagnosed as Crohn's disease complicated with a perianal
      fistula, which was refractory to the conventional therapy. After the 0, 2, and 6 
      week scheduled intravenous infusion of infliximab, the patient reached to
      clinical remission in both subjective symptoms and objective manifestations. For 
      children or young adults who develop Crohn's disease in a refractory course,
      infliximab may serve as a drug which leads to a clinical improvement or even to
      an extent of remission.

TI  - Crohn's disease in mainland China: a systematic analysis of 50 years of research.
PG  - 175-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease appears to be increasing in frequency in many areas
      of the world. However, little information with regard to disease incidence,
      prevalence and temporal trends has been published in China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
      this review is to better understand the occurrence of Crohn's disease in mainland
      China, and to give an overview of the current status of the disease. METHODS: We 
      used a computer-based literature search using 50-years of records from the
      Chinese Database of Biology and Medicine (CBM, 1979-2002), combined with a manual
      year-by-year search of the literature from 1950 to 1979. Each article was
      double-reviewed, and all descriptive epidemiological data were recorded, pooled
      and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1526 cases of Crohn's disease
      since 1950 have been reported by more than 50 hospitals from 22 provinces and
      cities in mainland China, comprising 884 male and 642 female patients, with a
      1.38:1 male predominance. More than 70% of patients were aged 20 to 50 years old,
      with a mean age of 37.2 +/- 2.68 (ranging from 1 to 83) years. The extrapolated
      disease incidence and prevalence rates are 0.28/100,000 person years and
      1.38/100,000 persons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence
      rates of Crohn's disease are still lower than those in Western and other Asian
      countries, but these rates have been increasing rapidly, and the disease is no
      longer uncommon. An underestimation may occur because the patients who were
      misdiagnosed or did not seek medical advice could not be included in the study. A
      future population-based survey is warranted.

TI  - [Extensive small bowel resections].
PG  - 631-4
AB  - Bowel resections of at least 70% of the total length give rise to nutritional and
      metabolic disorders. The consequences are also related to the site of the
      resection itself, to the causative disease and thus to the patient's
      morphological and functional adaptation capacity. Over the past 20 years we have 
      operated on 32 patients for vascular disorders, Crohn's disease, intestinal
      volvulus, actinic enteritis, and ileo-caecal carcinoma. In all patients total
      parenteral nutrition was started and followed by enteral nutrition and oral
      feeding after variable periods of time. The postoperative course, in terms of
      adaptation and stabilisation, was regular on most cases: only in the patients
      operated on for Crohn's disease was symptom and nutritional remission belated or 
      incomplete. The perioperative mortality was 34% (11 patients). The extent of the 
      resection was often conditioned by the topography of irreversible
      anatomico-pathological lesions and only in one case did a colic resection prove
      necessary. In more extensive resections, involving a longer adaptation time,
      enteral nutrition was supplemented with total parenteral nutrition for lengthier 
      periods.

TI  - Role of perioperative parenteral nutrition in severely malnourished patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5732-4
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of perioperative parenteral nutrition on serum
      immunoglobulin, weight change, and post-operative outcome in severely
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Thirty-two severely
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone surgery in our
      hospital were reviewed. Sixteen patients who received perioperative parenteral
      nutrition were enrolled in the study group, and the other 16 patients who did not
      receive parenteral nutrition were enrolled in the control group. Serum
      immunoglobulin, body mass index (BMI), liver function, weight change, and
      postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IgM levels elevated 1 
      wk before surgery in both groups, and decreased to normal value (from 139+/-41 to
      105+/-29 mg/dL, P = 0.04) 4 wk after operation in the study group, while no
      significant changes was noted in the control group (from 133+/-16 to 129+/-13
      mg/dL, P = 0.34). There were no significant changes in concentrations of IgG and 
      IgA. The BMI of the study group increased from 13.9+/-0.6 to 15.3+/-0.7 kg/m(2)
      (P = 0.02) with no significant change in the control group (14.1+/-0.7 and
      14.5+/-0.5, respectively, P = 0.81). The percentage of resuming work was higher
      in the study group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Perioperative
      parenteral nutrition possibly ameliorates the humoral immunity, reverses
      malnutrition, and facilitates rehabilitation.

TI  - Practical guide to intestinal rehabilitation for postresection intestinal
      failure: a case study.
PG  - 551-8
AB  - After massive small-intestinal resection or combined small-intestinal and colonic
      resection, diarrhea with resulting dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and
      malnutrition occur. Many patients become dependent on IV fluids and nutrition. An
      adaptation process manifested clinically by decreased diarrhea and improved
      nutrient absorption according to decreased parenteral nutrition and fluid
      requirements has been noted to occur over time. In some patients, adaptation is
      inadequate and may require special techniques to enhance and augment this
      process. This is a case of a 52-year-old woman who experienced increased stoma
      output 1 week after major intestinal resection, resulting in dehydration. She
      required IV fluids in order to maintain hydration. After the initiation of an
      intestinal rehabilitation program, which included modified diet, soluble fiber,
      oral rehydration solution (ORS), and medications, IV fluids were successfully
      weaned off in 3 months. She continues not to receive IV fluids and continues to
      follow the intestinal rehabilitation plan.

TI  - Measured versus predicted energy expenditure in children with inactive Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1047-55
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to assess if the estimated average
      requirements for energy for normal children (EAR) and the Schofield equation
      could reliably predict energy requirements in children with inactive Crohn's
      disease (CD). METHODS: Twenty-three children with inactive CD were studied,
      median age 14.3 years (range 7.8-16.9). Resting energy expenditure (REE) was
      measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with that predicted using the
      Schofield equation (BMR). Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured using REE
      and a 3-day activity diary and compared with EAR. RESULTS: REE ranged from 79% to
      136% of BMR. Mean REE was not significantly greater than mean BMR (P=0.25
      2-tailed t-test). TEE ranged from 72% to 163% of estimated average requirements
      for energy for children of that weight (EARw). EARw tended to underestimate TEE
      in large children and overestimate TEE in small children (Bland-Altman plot
      R=0.5, P=0.002). EARw was a poor predictor of TEE (R=0.35, P=0.1). EAR
      underestimated energy requirements by >500 kcal/day in 40% of the children.
      CONCLUSIONS: The Schofield equation and EAR are unreliable methods of predicting 
      total energy requirements in children with inactive CD with a significant
      potential to underestimate energy needs. When energy requirements were greater
      than EAR it was due to physical activity and body habitus rather than raised REE.

TI  - Success rate and duration of paediatric outpatient colonoscopy.
PG  - 877-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: The paediatric colonoscopy completion rates have rarely been
      reported. AIMS: We sought to evaluate colonoscopy completion rate and compare the
      rates using colonoscope versus enteroscope. METHODS: We prospectively
      investigated 60 patients who underwent colonoscopy between July 1999 and June
      2001. The following data were collected: demographics, type of endoscope used,
      extent of colonoscopy, indication for procedure, histology, adverse events and
      time to reach the caecum and the terminal ileum. RESULTS: Sixty colonoscopies
      were performed during the study period, 30 with an enteroscope and 30 with a
      colonoscope. The caecum was reached in 56/60 (93%) and the terminal ileum in
      50/60 (83%). An average time of 12.61 min (S.D. 7.3) was necessary to advance the
      instrument from the anus to the caecum, and additional 3.67 min (S.D. 3.62) to
      terminal ileum. There was no difference in the success rate between enteroscope
      and colonoscope. Six patients (10%) had definitive diagnosis established because 
      a full colonoscopy was performed. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION:
      Paediatric colonoscopy to the caecum can be completed safely and expeditiously in
      more than 90% of procedures. Various types of instruments do not appear to
      influence completion rate. Full colonoscopy contributes to the establishment of a
      definitive diagnosis.

TI  - Treatment of active Crohn's disease in children using partial enteral nutrition
      with liquid formula: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 356-61
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) with a liquid formula can
      suppress gut inflammation and induce remission in active Crohn's disease. The
      mechanism is obscure. Studies have suggested that long term nutritional
      supplementation with a liquid formula (partial enteral nutrition (PEN)) may also 
      suppress inflammation and prevent relapse. The aim of this study was to compare
      PEN with conventional TEN in active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty 
      children with a paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI)>20 were
      randomly assigned to receive 50% (PEN) or 100% (TEN) of their energy requirement 
      as elemental formula for six weeks. The PEN group was encouraged to eat an
      unrestricted diet while those receiving TEN were not allowed to eat. The primary 
      outcome was achievement of remission (PCDAI<10). Secondary analyses of changes in
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein, albumin, and platelets 
      were performed to look for evidence of anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS:
      Remission rate with PEN was lower than with TEN (15% v 42%; p=0.035). Although
      PCDAI fell in both groups (p=0.001 for both), the reduction was greater with TEN 
      (p=0.005). Moreover, the fall in PCDAI with PEN was due to symptomatic and
      nutritional benefits. With both treatments there were significant improvements in
      relation to abdominal pain, "sense of wellbeing", and nutritional status.
      However, only TEN led to a reduction in diarrhoea (p=0.02), an increase in
      haemoglobin and albumin, and a fall in platelets and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: TEN
      suppresses inflammation in active Crohn's disease but PEN does not. This suggests
      that long term nutritional supplementation, although beneficial to some patients,
      is unlikely to suppress inflammation and so prevent disease relapse.

TI  - Long-term clinical behavior of jejunoileal involvement in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 575-8
AB  - Diffuse and extensive jejunoileal Crohn's disease is an uncommon entity. In 39
      patients, including 21 males and 18 females, followed for a mean duration of over
      16 years between 1979 and 2004, the extent of disease was defined and disease
      behaviour characterized. Over 80% of patients had concomitant colonic and/or
      gastroduodenal involvement with Crohn's disease, suggesting that this entity may 
      represent a specific clinical phenotype of extensive disease localization.
      Classification of Crohn's disease behaviour using the Vienna classification
      schema revealed that virtually all patients in this study suffered from
      intestinal stricture formation or penetrating disease complications. Moreover,
      pharmacological therapies with corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs were
      rarely successful, with virtually all patients requiring at least one, and
      usually multiple, intestinal resections. Finally, most patients required
      long-term nutritional support, often with home parenteral nutrition. New
      treatments are required, possibly defined on the basis of their effectiveness in 
      reducing the severity and extent of intestinal disease, rather than more
      conventional statistically driven reductions in disease activity indexes.

TI  - Energy intakes of children with Crohn's disease treated with enteral nutrition as
      primary therapy.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition (EN) is widely used and is effective in the
      treatment of children with Crohn's disease given as an exclusive feed for 6-8
      weeks. Current dietetic practice during EN is to recommend an energy intake based
      on estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy for age. AIMS: To examine
      factors affecting energy intake and weight gain during EN in relation to disease 
      site and nutritional status. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study examining
      energy intake and weight gain during the exclusive EN feeding period in 40
      patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's in relation to EAR, nutritional status,
      disease site. RESULTS: All patients improved clinically and gained weight during 
      EN with improvement in the CRP as a marker of the systemic inflammatory response.
      Energy intake was higher than EAR in 82% (33/40 patients), with the median 117.5%
      of EAR. Weight gain correlated with body mass index standard deviation score (P =
      0.001) at start of treatment, but not energy intake or CRP. CONCLUSION: Estimated
      average requirement underestimates energy intakes in most children with newly
      diagnosed Crohn's disease. During EN, an energy intake in the range of 100-149%
      (median 117.5%) EAR for energy for age may be required. Energy balance studies in
      children with active disease are required.

TI  - [The importance of nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease in children].
PG  - 564-6, 598
AB  - Many children with inflammatory bowel disease, mainly Crohn's disease, suffer
      from malnutrition and growth retardation. Maintenance of adequate nutrition is
      extremely important in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.
      This can usually be achieved by exclusive elemental formulae and polymeric
      formulae and rarely necessitates the use of parenteral nutrition. This review
      presents an update on the nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children.

TI  - High-dose fish oil and antioxidants in Crohn's disease and the response of bone
      turnover: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with altered bone turnover that may be influenced
      by nutritional status, the systemic inflammatory response, cytokine production by
      circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMC) and antioxidant
      micronutrient intake. High-dose fish oil is associated with reductions in disease
      relapse and inflammatory markers, and modulates PBMC function. The effect of fish
      oil plus antioxidants on bone turnover and PBMC function (the production of
      interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E2) in Crohn's disease was investigated in a
      randomised-controlled trial. Patients with currently or recently raised
      biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein > or = 6.9 mg/l or
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or =18 mm/h) received fish oil (providing 2.7
      g/d EPA and DHA) and antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, and Se) (n 31) or placebo
      (n 30) for 24 weeks. Bone turnover was assessed by measuring the concentrations
      of urinary deoxypyridinoline (bone resorption) and serum osteocalcin (bone
      formation). Fish oil plus antioxidants were associated with increases in EPA, DHA
      Se in plasma (all P < 0.01), and with a reduction in interferon-gamma production 
      by mitogen-stimulated PBMC, which demonstrated a negative correlation with
      deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r - 0.33, P = 0.009). There were 
      no differences between the groups at 24 weeks in the response of
      deoxypyridinoline or osteocalcin or their ratio, or in nutritional status.
      Dietary supplementation in Crohn's disease with high intakes of EPA and DHA, as
      fish oil, plus antioxidants was associated with a modulated production of
      interferon-gamma by PBMC but not altered indices of bone turnover.

TI  - Colonic Crohn's disease in children does not respond well to treatment with
      enteral nutrition if the ileum is not involved.
PG  - 1471-5
AB  - Data supporting a response to treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition in
      pediatric colonic Crohn's disease are few. We examined clinical and biochemical
      responses of ileal, colonic, and ileocolonic Crohn's disease and assessed the
      endoscopic and histological colonic mucosal response in the colonic and
      ileocolonic groups. We prospectively enrolled 65 children (age: 8-17 years) with 
      acute intestinal Crohn's disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      [PCDAI] >20). After ileocolonoscopy, gastroscopy, and a barium meal and
      follow-through, they were distributed into three groups (ileal, n = 12,
      ileocolonic, n = 39; and colonic, n = 14). All patients received exclusive
      polymeric feed as treatment, with a repeat endoscopy at completion of treatment. 
      At enrollment the ileal group had significantly less severe disease (P = 0.05)
      compared to the colonic and ileocolonic groups. However, the colonic disease
      group showed the least fall in PCDAI scores at completion of treatment with
      enteral nutrition (P = 0.03), with the lowest remission rate (50%, vs 82.1% in
      the ileocolonic and 91.7% in the ileal group [chi2 test, P = 0.021]). Endoscopic 
      and histologic colonic mucosal assessment showed a post-treatment improvement in 
      the ileocolonic (P < or = 0.01) but not in the colonic disease group (P = ns).
      Children with disease in the colon respond better to enteral nutrition if the
      ileum is also involved. This may be due to different underlying inflammatory
      mechanisms. Detailed pretreatment assessment in studies of Crohn's disease
      according to disease distribution with appropriate individualized tailoring of
      treatment may be important in this regard.

TI  - [Nutritional treatment in childhood Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1255-66
AB  - Growth retardation and delay in sexual maturation are the major complications of 
      child-onset Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional assessment and monitoring should
      comprise: weight and height measurement with calculation of respective velocities
      (growth velocity should be > or = 4-5 cm/year during the prepubertal period);
      pubertal staging; dietetic evaluation; laboratory analysis for mineral, vitamin
      and trace element deficiencies; bone age. At diagnosis, weight loss and growth
      delay are present in 80-90% and 1/3 of cases, respectively. In case of an acute
      flare-up in a CD child with normal nutritional status, nutritional therapy is
      limited to oral feeding, with a caloric intake at least equal to recommended
      dietary allowances for age and sex. A low-fiber diet is advised in case of small 
      bowel stenosis. No diet has been shown as efficient in the long-term maintenance 
      of remission. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an alternative to
      corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute flare-up of CD, especially in case 
      of malnutrition. Prolonged nocturnal EN is of great interest for the treatment of
      growth retardation and delay of sexual maturation and in case of
      steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory CD. In case of steroid-dependent CD with 
      no delay of growth and/or sexual maturation, immunomodulating agents are nowadays
      an alternative to long-term EN. Efficacy of polymeric solutions is identical to
      that of semi-elemental or elemental solutions. Parenteral nutrition is limited to
      an acute flare-up with resistance to medical treatment and/or EN, and
      contraindications to surgery; occlusion or fistula; short bowel syndrome.

TI  - Essential fatty acid depletion in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 573-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from
      malabsorption and malnutrition and therefore may be at risk of developing
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency. The aim of this study was to
      investigate PUFA status in children with IBD and the possible relationship to
      disease activity and nutritional status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed the
      fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids (%wt/wt) of 21 children aged
      5.5-18 years with IBD (ulcerative colitis, 15; Crohn's disease, 6) with mild or
      moderate disease activity. The clinical symptoms and biochemical indices of
      disease activity and nutritional status (lean and fat body mass, Hb, albumin
      serum conc.) were also determined. RESULTS: The patients had lower phospholipid
      PUFAs than 13 healthy, aged-matched controls (25.8+/-5.2 versus 34.2+/-5.7,
      M+/-SD, p<0.001), mainly due to lower values of linoleic acid (18:2n-6,
      14.0+/-3.8 versus 18.3+/-4.3, p<0.01) and its major metabolite arachidonic acid
      (20:4n-6, 5.3+/-2.0 versus 9.3+/-1.9, p<0.0001). There were also higher values of
      a-linolenic acid (18:3n-3, 0.3+/-0.4 versus 0.2+/-0.1, p<0.01) while the
      long-chain n-3 PUFA-eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were normal. Total
      n-6 PUFA correlated inversely to erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.01),
      seromucoid (p<0.05) and positively to Hb concentration (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a high risk of n-6 PUFA depletion, 
      which is related to disease activity.

TI  - Interventions for growth failure in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD003873
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing condition.
      Fifteen to forty per cent of children with Crohn's disease have growth
      retardation (Griffiths 1993a). Some treatment modalities including
      corticosteroids have been implicated in growth failure but it is thought mainly
      to be secondary to uncontrolled disease activity (Motil 1993; Markowitz 1993).
      Growth is fundamental to the practice of pediatrics, so by taking growth as the
      primary outcome measure we address issues important to both patients, their
      families and pediatricians. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the
      different modalities available for the treatment of childhood Crohn's disease
      with regard to the reversal of growth failure and the promotion of normal growth.
      SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches were made of the following databases using the
      Collaborative Review Group Search Strategy: EMBASE (1984-2004), MEDLINE
      (1966-2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Cochrane
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized
      Trials Register and the Science Citation Index. Abstracts from the major
      gastrointestinal research meetings and references from published articles were
      also reviewed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials pertaining to
      children less than 18 years of age with Crohn's disease were selected. Those with
      growth as an outcome measure were included in the review. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each
      trial was independently reviewed by two reviewers. Only one good quality
      randomized controlled trial was included in the review and therefore no
      statistical analysis was possible. MAIN RESULTS: Three randomized controlled
      trials were identified. One was of good methodological quality (Markowitz 2000). 
      This study looked at the use of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) as a steroid sparing
      agent. No difference in linear growth was observed between the intervention and
      placebo groups, although the total steroid dose received over the 18 month follow
      up period was reduced in the group receiving 6-MP. The two remaining randomized
      controlled trials (Sanderson 1987; Thomas 1993a) consider the use of enteral
      feeding versus corticosteroids for induction of remission, with height velocity
      standard deviation score at 6 months as an outcome measure. Although of less
      rigorous methodological quality, the results of these studies are discussed in
      detail in the review. In both studies height velocity standard deviation scores
      were significantly increased in the enteral feeding group compared with the
      corticosteroid group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In addition to these randomized
      controlled trials, a body of lower quality evidence does exist relevant to two
      other important interventions; the use of supplemental enteral nutrition (Morin
      1980; Belli 1988; Israel 1995) and the judicious use of surgical interventions in
      pre-pubertal children with refractory disease (Alperstein 1985; Lipson 1990;
      McLain 1990). Newer treatments, such as infliximab, are now becoming more widely 
      used and may offer advantages in promoting growth. These effects are as yet
      unstudied. This review highlights the need for large, multi centre studies of the
      different treatment options in paediatric Crohn's disease and the importance of
      standardised measurements of growth, such as height velocity standard deviation
      scores and height standard deviation scores as outcome measures.

TI  - Place of probiotics.
PG  - 318-25
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

TI  - Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 147-63
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects the gastrointestinal
      system but it is associated with a large number of extraintestinal manifestations
      (EIM). These extraintestinal disorders can significantly contribute to morbidity 
      and impair the overall life quality. EIM may be diagnosed before, concurrently
      with, or after the diagnosis of IBD is made. The precise etiology of EIM remains 
      unknown. It currently is believed that mucosa from the underlying bowel disease
      may provide associated immune responses for the inflammatory process in the
      extraintestinal sites. The involvement of autoimmune mechanisms has been
      suggested when the shared and unique epitopes in the human colon, eye, joint and 
      biliary epithelium were detected. Recently, the presence of long-lived
      populations of memory lymphocytes has been discovered which arise as a
      consequence of bowel inflammation and express homing receptors that direct their 
      migration not only to the gut but also to the extraintestinal sites. The most
      common extraintestinal disorders associated with IBD include dermatologic,
      ophthalmologic, musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary diseases, although virtually
      every organ system may be involved. If these disorders can be considered as the
      real extraintestinal manifestations of IBD or represent just association between 
      different syndromes of autoimmune etiology, is still not clear. It is important
      to acquire knowledge on these extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis to start the respective treatment early.

      inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective population-based study in northern
      France (1988-1999).
PG  - 49-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and location at diagnosis of inflammatory
      bowel disease in children and adolescents in northern France between 1988 and
      1999. METHODS: A 12-year prospective population-based study was conducted by
      gastroenterologists and pediatric gastroenterologists of northern France
      (1,312,141 children <17 years of age). RESULTS: From 1988 to 1999, 509 cases of
      childhood inflammatory bowel disease were recorded (7.2% of all inflammatory
      bowel disease cases in Northern France): 367 Crohn disease, 122 ulcerative
      colitis and 20 indeterminate colitis. The mean standardized incidence was
      3.1/10(5) for inflammatory bowel disease as a whole (2.3 for Crohn disease, 0.8
      for ulcerative colitis and 0.12 for indeterminate colitis). Crohn disease
      location at diagnosis was: small bowel and colon (71%), colon only (10%) and
      small bowel only (19%). Location of initial ulcerative colitis was: proctitis
      (11%), left colitis (57%) and pancolitis (32%). Although ulcerative colitis
      incidence remained stable (0.8), Crohn disease incidence increased from 2.1 in
      1988 to 1990 to 2.6 in 1997 to 1999 (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of
      Crohn disease in the children of northern France showed an increasing trend (20%;
      not significant) during the 12-year period while the incidence of ulcerative
      colitis remained stable. In the entire population(children and adults)the
      incidence of Crohn disease increased significantly (+23%; P < 0.001), while the
      incidence of ulcerative colitis decreased (-17%; P < 0.0001).

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents: recommendations for
      diagnosis--the Porto criteria.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease may present before the age of 20 years in
      25% to 30% of all patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reported incidence
      figures vary considerably depending on the collection of data. Multicenter,
      multinational collaboration is needed when studying pediatric inflammatory bowel 
      disease. The essential first step is uniformity in the work-up and criteria used 
      for diagnosis. The Porto diagnostic criteria presented here provide the tool that
      is needed. These criteria are the result of consensus reached by the ESPGHAN
      inflammatory bowel disease working group. Diagnosis of Crohn disease, ulcerative 
      colitis and indeterminate colitis is based on clinical signs and symptoms,
      endoscopy and histology and radiology. Every child suspected of inflammatory
      bowel disease should undergo a complete diagnostic program consisting of
      colonoscopy with ileal intubation, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and (in all
      cases except in definite ulcerative colitis) radiologic contrast imaging of the
      small bowel. Multiple biopsies from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract
      are needed for a complete histologic evaluation. A diagnosis of indeterminate
      colitis cannot be made unless a full diagnostic program has been performed.

TI  - TNF promoter polymorphisms and modulation of growth retardation and disease
      severity in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1598-604
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Delayed growth is common in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Multiple 
      factors have been shown to affect growth in this situation, the most prominent
      being the presence and severity of inflammation and inadequate nutritional
      intake. Inflammation, anorexia, and weight loss are all manifestations of
      circulating TNF-alpha, which is elevated in CD. The ability to secrete TNF-alpha 
      may be affected by polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha promoter. The aim of our study 
      was to determine whether growth retardation and disease severity in pediatric
      onset CD are affected by TNF promoter genotype. METHODS: Genotyping for TNF-alpha
      and NOD2/CARD15 single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in 87 patients with
      detailed growth records. Parameters including disease location and disease
      severity were recorded, and the effect of these polymorphisms on Z-scores for
      height and weight at disease onset and during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS:
      Lower age of onset was linked to more height retardation, while the presence of
      colonic disease and the absence of ileal disease were more likely to predict the 
      absence of growth retardation. The presence of two polymorphisms thought to
      decrease circulating TNF-alpha was associated with higher mean Z-scores for
      height and a trend toward less growth retardation. Two other polymorphisms were
      modestly associated with disease severity. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in the
      TNF-alpha promoter may independently modulate growth and disease severity in
      pediatric onset CD. The effect of these polymorphisms does not appear to be
      mediated via weight loss, and is relatively modest.

TI  - Enteral nutrition and microflora in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - S173-5; discussion S175-8, S184-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an established primary therapy
      for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The mechanism of action of such treatment is 
      still conjectural. The aim of the present study was to investigate if EN-induced 
      remission is associated with modification of the fecal microflora in CD. METHODS:
      Stool samples were collected from 5 healthy children and adolescents over a
      period of 3 months, and from 9 children and adolescents with active CD. To induce
      disease remission, children with CD received a course of exclusive EN for 8 weeks
      with a polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle). At the end of the course of
      exclusive EN, children returned to a free diet but continued to take 40% of the
      daily caloric intake as polymeric formula. Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S
      ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction and temperature gradient gel
      electrophoresis (TGGE) with direct visual comparison of band profiles of PCR
      products. RESULTS: In 8 of 9 children, the exclusive EN alone induced disease
      remission. In 1 child, it was necessary to add steroids to the exclusive EN
      course to achieve remission. In all children with CD, analysis of gel band
      distribution revealed profound modification of the fecal microflora after
      exclusive EN. Variations of band distribution corresponding to different
      bacterial species were observed also in children on partial EN and required time 
      to achieve stability of the band profile. In contrast, control healthy children
      showed a host-specific and stable TGGE profile over time. CONCLUSION: These data 
      suggest that a possible mechanism of action of EN in inducing disease remission
      in CD is the capacity of modification of gut microflora. Possible explanations of
      such capacity are both low residue and prebiotic properties of the polymeric
      liquid formula.

TI  - The use of enteral nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease in adults.
PG  - S166-9; discussion S169-72, S184-8
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing disease and none of the treatments
      developed so far can cure it. Artificial nutrition is effective to both treat
      malnutrition when present and induce remission. However, striking advances in
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating therapies (including infliximab) and low
      compliance to treatment in the first trials have limited its place in the
      management of adults to drug-resistant patients. Randomized controlled trials
      show that artificial nutrition is effective in >50% of the cases in this selected
      population. Significant progress has recently been made to improve the
      palatability (and thus acceptability) of some enteral solutions, which can be
      consumed by the oral route and as pharmaconutrition. We reviewed the literature
      on enteral nutrition in adults with Crohn's disease. We present herein the
      results of the studies performed with antioxidants, glutamine, short-chain fatty 
      acids, prebiotics, probiotics, low microparticle diets, and a TGFbeta2 enriched
      formulation.

TI  - Synergy between immunosuppressive therapy and enteral nutrition in the management
      of childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - S160-3; discussion S163-5, S184-8
AB  - Induction of a remission in children with Crohn's disease is increasingly
      successful. However this success is dependent on what measure we use to define
      "remission." Achieving a clinical remission is possible in >70% of children with 
      Crohn's disease at diagnosis, while a mucosal or even immunological remission may
      occur in <50%. The importance of what ;degree of remission' should be achieved
      during maintenance therapy is discussed. Does early aggressive management with
      immunomodulators or biological agents indeed alter the natural history of the
      disease, and is it possible to give a prognosis based on either a snap-shot of
      endoscopic appearance, or a mucosal cytokine profile? The potential benefits of
      using a 6-8 week course of exclusive enteral nutrition as an induction therapy in
      combination with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine are discussed. Whole protein
      formulae are safe and effective at achieving a clinical remission, however they
      are not a long-term maintenance strategy. Given the relative safety of these
      immunosuppressants and their efficacy in children treated at diagnosis, it is now
      more important than ever to predict which individuals will benefit from use of
      immunomodulators very early in the disease process. There is brief mention of
      enteral nutrition as maintenance therapy. Given the very limited data available, 
      it is still not possible to recommend long-term nutrition supplementation as a
      maintenance therapy in all children. However, some children may respond to
      repeated shorter cycles of exclusive enteral nutrition in the absence of other
      therapeutic options.

TI  - Enteral nutrition as primary therapy in childhood Crohn's disease: control of
      intestinal inflammation and anabolic response.
PG  - S151-5; discussion S155-9, S184-8
AB  - Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition that 
      can significantly impact normal growth and development. This influences choice of
      both initial and ongoing management. The goal of therapy is to induce and
      maintain remission with minimal side effects. Enteral nutrition is effective in
      active disease and will induce disease remission in most cases avoiding
      corticosteroid use. The high frequency of relapse means additional
      immunosuppressive therapies are usually required but nutrition remains a key
      priority as part of the subsequent management strategy.

PG  - S134-8; discussion S138-40, S184-8
AB  - Enteral nutrition has a positive effect on growth in children with active Crohn's
      disease. The question arises: is this is due only to improved nutrition? Enteral 
      formulas may also directly reduce inflammation, lowering the expression of
      cytokines like interleukin (IL)-6 that inhibit growth. Four lines of evidence
      support the hypothesis that enteral formulas directly lessen inflammation:
      enteral nutrition directly affects the inflamed intestine; changes in
      inflammatory markers precede repletion of nutrition status; molecular pathways
      exist linking changes in luminal contents to the expression of class II MHC genes
      in intestinal epithelium in animal studies; and enteral formulas have a direct
      effect on cytokine expression by intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  - Control of systemic and local inflammation with transforming growth factor beta
      containing formulas.
PG  - S126-8; discussion S129-33, S184-8
AB  - Enteral nutrition therapy with liquid diet has been shown to be effective in
      achieving clinical remission in intestinal Crohn's disease. The mechanism of
      action of this therapy, however, is still poorly understood. As part of our
      assessment of the action of 3 related polymeric enteral therapies, we have used a
      variety of techniques to document the histological and cytokine responses, in the
      mucosa and, systemically, to these treatments. The feeds studied (AL110, Modulen 
      IBD and ACD004 [Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland]) all have casein as the protein
      source, are lactose free and are rich in transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta). They have all been shown to induce clinical remission associated with
      mucosal healing. In the case of Modulen IBD, as well as mucosal macroscopic and
      histological healing there was a fall in mucosal proinflammatory cytokines:
      interleukin-1 mRNA in colonic and ileal, interleukin-8 mRNA in the colon and
      interferon gamma mRNA in the ileum, but a rise in the regulatory cytokine
      TGF-beta mRNA in the ileum. These results indicate that these formulas are
      influencing the disease process itself, and thus suggest that the clinical
      remission achieved is a result of a reduction in inflammation, rather than a
      consequence of some other nutrition effect.

TI  - Immunopathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - S118-24; discussion S124-5, S184-8
AB  - This review highlights the huge advances made in the understanding of Crohn's
      disease in the last 15 years. The pathogenic immune response in the gut wall is a
      highly polarised T helper cell type 1 response, probably directed against
      antigens of the commensal flora. There is marked over-expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and
      increased production of matrix degrading enzymes by fibroblasts and macrophages, 
      which are probably responsible for ulceration and fistula formation. Crohn's
      disease runs in families and the susceptibility genes identified so far are
      associated with innate recognition of microbial products (Nod2) or epithelial
      barrier function (OCTN cation transporter genes and DLG5). Endogenous healing
      pathways mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 are inhibited because
      mucosal inflammatory cells express Smad7, the endogenous intracellular inhibitor 
      of TGF-beta signalling. This makes it unlikely that enteral feeds containing
      TFG-beta are therapeutic by means of direct anti-inflammatory effects, however
      TGF-beta may still be involved because it is a well known epithelial motogen and 
      may promote mucosal healing, in synergy with changes in mucosal bacterial
      populations as a result of the change in the diet.

TI  - Enteral nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - S108-12; discussion S112-7, S184-8
AB  - Exclusive feeding of defined formula diets has been used successfully as an
      alternative to corticosteroid treatment of active Crohn's disease, but the
      mechanism of efficacy remains conjectural. Recognition that polymorphisms in the 
      NOD2/CARD15 gene confer susceptibility to Crohn's disease has increased
      appreciation of the interactions between the innate immune system and enteric
      bacteria, which lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. The 2 major goals of
      this workshop are: first, in light of current understanding of pathogenesis, to
      examine possible mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition as primary therapy;
      and second, to make evidence-based recommendations concerning its use in the new 
      era of biologic therapies, when mucosal healing has become a realistic goal.
      Factors influencing efficacy, including duration, location of intestinal
      inflammation, and formula composition require consideration.

TI  - Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma mimicking segmental Crohn's colitis.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colon is a rare entity with a dismal
      prognosis, mainly due to a delay in diagnosis. Here, we present a case of a
      30-year-old Filipino woman who presented with symptoms mimicking inflammatory
      bowel disease. A barium enema and colonoscopy demonstrated a stricture in the
      rectosigmoid region. A biopsy revealed granulomatous changes indicative of
      inflammatory bowel disease. Despite initial improvement of her symptoms on total 
      parenteral nutrition and steroids, the patient relapsed several weeks later with 
      recurrent left lower quadrant pain. A subsequent biopsy revealed poorly
      differentiated signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colon. She was treated
      surgically with a left hemi-colectomy and primary repair. A high degree of
      suspicion is necessary to correctly diagnose these, often young, patients with
      primary signet-ring cell carcinoma early and have a positive impact on survival. 
      The literature on primary signet-ring cell carcinoma is reviewed.

TI  - Bone turnover and nutritional status in Crohn's disease: relationship to
      circulating mononuclear cell function and response to fish oil and antioxidants.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with osteoporosis, malnutrition and altered
      function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The responses of
      circulating immune cells and extra-intestinal manifestations to increased
      inflammatory activity and to modulation by dietary supplementation are uncertain.
      The relationships between disease status, bone turnover and body mass and
      composition, PBMC function and fatty acid availability have been investigated in 
      patients with Crohn's disease. The availability of n-3 and n-6 PUFA is altered in
      adult patients and interferon (IFN)-gamma production by PBMC is lower. Increased 
      inflammatory activity is associated with increased bone resorption in adult
      patients and decreased body mass in paediatric patients. In healthy male subjects
      there is a proportionate relationship between supplementary intake of EPA and DHA
      (0.3-2.0 g as fish oil/d) in combination with antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E
      and Se) and incorporation into plasma phospholipids and PBMC, and a non-linear
      relationship with PBMC synthesis of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and prostaglandin E2
      (decrease) and IFN-gamma (increase). In adults with Crohn's disease high-dose
      fish oil (2.7 g EPA+DHA/d) in combination with antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E 
      and Se) increases the EPA and DHA content of PBMC and decreases the production of
      IFN-gamma by PBMC, but is not associated with effects on bone turnover or
      nutritional status.

TI  - Fast track open ileo-colic resections for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 394-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Introduction of multimodal rehabilitation programmes after open
      colonic surgery for noninflammatory bowel disease has reduced hospital stay to
      about 2-3 days, but no data are available from open ileo-colic surgery for
      Crohn's disease with multimodal rehabilitation regimens. Therefore, the aim of
      study was to assess outcome after ileo-colic resections for Crohn's disease with 
      multimodal rehabilitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive
      ileo-colic resections for Crohn's disease in 29 patients received epidural
      analgesia and enforced postoperative oral nutrition and mobilization with a
      scheduled stay of 2 days. RESULTS: Median time to defaecation was 2.5 days and
      postoperative hospital stay was 3 days. During a 30-day postoperative follow-up
      there was two re-admissions, one for mechanical bowel obstruction (9 days) and
      one because of fever and vomiting (6 days). Except for one wound abscess, one
      cystitis and one pneumonia, no other complications occurred. CONCLUSION:
      Fast-track multimodal rehabilitation in open ileo-colic resections for Crohn's
      disease reduces hospital stay and with low morbidity and readmission rate.

TI  - Impact of elemental diet on mucosal inflammation in patients with active Crohn's 
      disease: cytokine production and endoscopic and histological findings.
PG  - 580-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of elemental diet on 
      mucosal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), mainly by cytokine measurements.
      METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with active CD were treated with an
      elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks. The mucosal biopsies were obtained from the
      terminal ileum and large bowel before and after treatment. As a control group,
      mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 patients without inflammation. Mucosal
      cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: After treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 20 patients (71%).
      Endoscopic healing and improvement rates were 44% and 76% in the terminal ileum
      and 39% and 78% in the large bowel, respectively. Histologic healing and
      improvement rates were 19% and 54% in the terminal ileum and 20% and 55% in the
      large bowel, respectively. Before treatment, the mucosal concentrations of
      interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha in the ileum and large bowel were significantly higher than
      in controls. These cytokine concentrations decreased to the levels of control
      after treatment. IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in the ileum and large bowel was
      significantly lower than in controls before treatment. The ratio increased to the
      level of controls after treatment. The endoscopic and histologic healing of the
      mucosal inflammation was associated with a decline of the mucosal cytokines and
      an increase of the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The elemental diet
      (Elental) reduced mucosal cytokine production and corrected an imbalance between 
      proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD.

TI  - Long-term outcome of nutritional therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 775-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Long-term effects of using enteral feed therapy to induce
      remission in paediatric Crohn's disease are poorly documented. The aim of this
      study is to examine the short and long-term impact of enteral nutrition as
      primary therapy for children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. METHODS: Since
      1994, a data base was set up in Bristol for all children with inflammatory bowel 
      diseases. The data of newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease in whom
      enteral nutrition was used as the primary therapy (44 children) was analysed,
      with particular reference to time to remission, to first and subsequent relapse, 
      and to first steroid usage. RESULTS: Forty out of 44 patients (90%) responded to 
      enteral nutrition, with a median time to remission of 6 weeks. 25 of these 40
      (62%) relapsed, with a median duration of remission of 54.5 weeks (range 4-312). 
      15 (38%) have not relapsed. 21 of the 44 (47%) have not received steroids. In
      those who eventually required steroids, their use was postponed for a median 68
      weeks (range 6-190). Site of disease activity had no impact on response to
      enteral nutrition, but there was a trend towards earlier relapse in those with
      isolated colonic involvement. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that there are
      long-term benefits to the use of enteral nutrition to induce remission in
      children with Crohn's disease Steroids may be avoided in nearly half the cases
      and, in others, their use postponed by 68 weeks.

TI  - Nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is
      widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a
      variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to
      ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN)
      or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine
      receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. 
      Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based
      enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third
      is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term
      treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as
      unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have
      attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN,
      especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much
      long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy
      because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data
      show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on
      clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were
      resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering
      CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic
      colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the
      treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a 
      maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to
      Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do
      not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies,
      including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over 
      those we have at present.

TI  - Immune activation and nutritional status in adult Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent attention focused on the effect of inflammatory cytokines on
      intermediary metabolism contributing to the nutritional disturbances observed in 
      acute or chronic inflammatory diseases. AIMS: To examine the interactions between
      immune activation and nutritional parameters in adult Crohn's disease patients.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed anthropometric and biochemical nutritional
      parameters in 40 Crohn's disease patients and 26 healthy controls, and related
      them to inflammatory and immune markers. RESULTS: Weight, body mass index,
      mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, as well as albumin,
      transthyretin, retinol binding protein, insulin growth factor-I and Vitamin A
      were significantly decreased in Crohn's disease patients and negatively
      correlated to disease activity. By contrast, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
      fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, alpha1-acylglycoprotein, soluble receptor of
      interleukin-2, blood neopterin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and
      interleukin-1beta concentrations were significantly higher in patients and
      positively correlated to disease activity. Nutritional parameters and acute phase
      reactants were linked to tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta
      concentrations, and markers of nutritional status were negatively correlated to
      positive acute phase reactants. CONCLUSIONS: In Crohn's disease, inflammatory
      cytokines appear partly responsible for decreased nutritional status. Thus,
      nutritional intervention to correct nutritional (in particular protein)
      depletion, and/or therapeutic intervention reducing inflammation and therefore
      restoring adequate nutritional proteins synthesis, appears a major therapeutic
      goal in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Effect of recombinant growth hormone treatment on children with Crohn's disease
      and short stature: a pilot study.
PG  - 435-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth failure frequently complicates Crohn's disease in childhood.
      Abnormalities in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis may
      occur. The effects of administered GH on growth have not been studied previously 
      in a randomized trial. METHODS: Seven children (6 boys and 1 girl; age, 11.9-16
      yr) with Crohn's disease and growth failure were enrolled. In phase 1, patients
      were randomized to either GH (0.05 mg/kg per day) or placebo; in phase 2,
      patients who received placebo during the first year received GH for various time 
      periods. Follow-up was every 3 months for up to 2 years. RESULTS: During placebo 
      treatment (4 patients), mean height-for-age z score (haz) increased 0.23 in the
      first half year and 0.55 in the second half year. The mean improvement in haz
      during the first half year of GH treatment (7 patients) was 0.13; during the
      second half year (5 patients), haz decreased 0.01. Effects of GH varied among
      patients; 2 patients grew only when nutritional supplementation was added.
      Observed changes were not statistically significant; however, the number of
      patients studied was small, and statistical analyses could have been affected by 
      sample size. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels correlated with height
      velocity. Only 2 patients later reached expected adult height. CONCLUSIONS: In
      this pilot study, GH treatment at the dose given did not stimulate growth in
      children with Crohn's disease and short stature. Whether or not GH plus
      nutritional therapy would be effective in promoting sustained catch-up growth
      remains to be determined.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in frequency in
      Australia. General practitioners play an important role in early diagnosis and in
      a multidisciplinary approach to managing such patients. Keeping abreast of
      evolving concepts, particularly in treatment, is challenging. OBJECTIVE: This
      article aims to address key issues in diagnosis and management to better equip
      general practitioners for their role in multidisciplinary management of patients 
      with IBD. DISCUSSION: Making the diagnosis can be difficult, but is facilitated
      by appropriate clinical suspicion and sensible judgment as to who undergoes
      diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy. Treatment of ulcerative colitis has changed
      little in recent years, except for our improved ability to deliver mesalazine to 
      the large bowel via the recent availability of several oral and rectal
      preparations. Prevention of relapse using these is an important strategy in the
      majority of patients. Treatment of Crohn disease is changing due to more
      realistic concepts of the natural history of the disease and the development of
      new, powerful anti-inflammatory therapies. Attention to issues other than
      intestinal inflammation such as nutrition, education and counselling, remain
      important in achieving optimal management.

TI  - Seasonality of vitamin D status and bone turnover in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1073-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: While winter-time vitamin D deficiency has been well-documented in
      Crohn's disease patients, less is known about vitamin D status during summertime 
      and whether a seasonal variation exists in bone turnover. AIMS: To compare
      vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients with age- 
      and sex-matched controls during late-summer and late-winter. SUBJECTS: Crohn's
      disease patients (n = 44; mean age 36.9 years, currently in remission) and
      matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork
      City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
      parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine
      analysed for N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen. RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D concentrations were significantly (P < 0.003) lower in Crohn's disease patients
      than in control subjects during both seasons. In Crohn's disease patients, serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) whereas serum
      parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and
      urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen levels were higher (P < 0.001) during
      late-winter than late-summer. CONCLUSION: There were notable seasonal variations 
      in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients. The
      impact of winter decline in vitamin D status and increase in bone turnover on
      long-term risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Crohn's disease patients is unclear.

TI  - Serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 574-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more
      than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy
      individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was 
      found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no
      significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls
      (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis
      (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly
      lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum
      selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of
      patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental
      diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20).
      CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in
      patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium
      status in various disorders.

TI  - Patient education in inflammatory bowel disease does not influence patients
      knowledge and long-term psychosocial well-being.
PG  - 367-71
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patient education is accepted in many disciplines as a valid
      component of disease management in chronic diseases. The aim of this prospective 
      study was to analyze the effects of an education program in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: 145 patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      were prospectively included: 73 were educated in four sessions, 72 were educated 
      after the one year evaluation period (control group). The following topics were
      presented: pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures, course of disease, medical and
      surgical treatment, nutrition, social problems and support, stress management,
      and coping with the disease. RESULTS: The repeated measurement two-way analysis
      of variances showed no effects of the patient education program on
      disease-related knowledge, depression and quality of life. CONCLUSION: This
      patient education program was not able to increase disease-related knowledge or
      psychosocial variables in patients with IBD. However, most of the patients were
      very satisfied with the education program, since as judged by their own
      assessment it helped them to act responsibly for themselves and their disease.

TI  - Terminal ileal stricture in Crohn's disease: treatment using a metallic enteral
      endoprosthesis.
PG  - 1081-5
AB  - Enteral strictures are a frequent indication for surgery in Crohn's disease.
      Postoperative complications are increased in patients with poor preoperative
      nutritional status, which is common in this patient population. We present a
      49-year-old female with longstanding Crohn's disease admitted to our Digestive
      Health Center with four weeks of increasing abdominal symptoms and radiographic
      evidence of small-bowel obstruction caused by ileal stricture. Given her poor
      nutritional status, our team elected to pursue metallic enteral stenting as a
      bridge to surgical resection. Two Wallstents were placed; luminal patency was
      subsequently confirmed by a fluoroscopic study. The patient tolerated regular
      diet and was discharged. When seen in follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and
      wished to defer surgical intervention indefinitely.

TI  - Resting energy expenditure in the parenterally fed pediatric population with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 102-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common sequela of Crohn's disease (CD) and may
      result in reduced skeletal muscle function and growth retardation. Energy
      requirements of parenterally fed hospitalized pediatric patients with active CD
      were measured using indirect calorimetry, to assess whether Food Agriculture
      Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations University
      (UNU) equations provide appropriate estimations of energy requirements in this
      patient population. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with active CD fed
      exclusively via parenteral nutrition (PN) were investigated. A chart review and
      patient interviews were conducted to assess disease duration, location,
      laboratory parameters, and symptomology associated with CD. Disease severity was 
      quantified using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Each subject
      underwent indirect calorimetry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and
      anthropometric assessment once the ordered PN met estimated macronutrient
      requirements of each patient (predicted resting energy expenditure x1.3).
      Predicted resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the FAO/WHO/UNU
      equations. RESULTS: REE showed a strong correlation with predicted REE (r(2) =
      .73, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Measured REE did not significantly differ from
      predicted resting energy requirements. This indicates that REE for the
      parenterally fed pediatric patients with CD can be accurately predicted using the
      FAO/WHO/UNU equations.

TI  - Wireless capsule endoscopy for obscure small-bowel disorders: final results of
      the first pediatric controlled trial.
PG  - 264-70
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obscure small-bowel disorders are jejunal and ileal lesions 
      undiagnosed by traditional imaging techniques (endoscopic, radiologic). We
      evaluated the diagnostic usefulness and safety of capsule endoscopy for obscure
      small-bowel disorders in children and adolescents. METHODS: Comparative,
      prospective, self-controlled trials in patients (age, 10-18 y) suspected to have 
      either small-bowel Crohn's disease, polyps, or obscure gastrointestinal (GI)
      bleeding. Capsule results were compared with the diagnostic imaging studies
      normally used in this age group. RESULTS: Among 20 patients suspected of Crohn's 
      disease, multiple lesions consistent with this diagnosis were observed by capsule
      endoscopy in 50%. Small-bowel Crohn's disease was ruled out in 8 patients.
      Eosinophilic enteropathy was found in 2 others. For polyp detection (n = 6),
      capsule endoscopy yielded 100% concordance with the control studies when analyzed
      per patient. However, capsule endoscopy revealed a greater number (50%) of
      polyps. Among patients with obscure bleeding (n = 4), the capsule examination
      confirmed a diagnosis of vascular malformations in 3. Capsule endoscopy more
      accurately identified the precise source of bleeding compared with angiography.
      All 30 capsule studies were well tolerated, although 1 capsule was retained owing
      to an inflammatory stenosis. The capsule eventually was expelled after
      corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy correctly diagnosed or
      excluded a bleeding source, small-bowel polyps, or Crohn's disease of the small
      bowel in 29 of 30 patients. Capsule endoscopy permits an accurate, noninvasive
      approach for diagnosing obscure small bowel lesions in children over the age of
      10.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of endoscopic balloon dilation of symptomatic upper and lower
      gastrointestinal Crohn's disease strictures.
PG  - 284-90
AB  - GOALS: To evaluate efficacy and safety of endoscopic balloon dilation with or
      without intralesional steroid injection, of symptomatic upper gastrointestinal
      (UGI) and lower gastrointestinal (LGI) Crohn's disease (CD) strictures.
      BACKGROUND: Patients with CD commonly develop obstructive symptoms secondary to
      gastrointestinal strictures. When these do not resolve with medical management,
      surgery is usually the only alternative. Limited data are available on the safety
      and efficacy of endoscopic through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilation of CD
      strictures. STUDY: We performed a retrospective review of TTS balloon dilations
      done on CD-related UGI and LGI strictures. Postdilation intralesional steroid
      injections were done at the discretion of the endoscopist. Stricture was defined 
      as luminal stenosis <10 mm in diameter, through which a scope could not be
      passed. Technical success was defined as the ability of the scope to traverse the
      stricture postdilation. Long-term success rate was claimed if a patient remained 
      asymptomatic and did not require surgery or further endoscopic dilation. RESULTS:
      Over 4 years, we performed 29 stricture dilations on 17 patients (10 female, 7
      male) with 20 strictures. The mean follow-up period was 18.8 months (range, 5-50 
      months). Stricture locations were as follows: rectal, 5; sigmoid colon, 2;
      colo-colonic anastomosis, 3; ileocolonic anastomosis, 4; ileum, 1; descending
      colon, 1; cecum, 1; and distal duodenal bulb, 3 patients. Technical success was
      achieved in 28 of 29 stricture dilations (96.5%). Ten strictures (34.5%) were
      dilated to <15 mm and 19 (65.5%) to > or = 15 mm diameter. Long-term success rate
      in the <15 mm group was 70%, and in > or = 15 mm group was 68.4%. Four quadrant
      steroid injections were done on 11 strictures. The recurrence rate in this group 
      was 10% and that in the nonsteroid group was 31.3%. The overall long-term success
      rate was 76.5% by intent-to-treat analysis. Three perforations occurred (all
      colonic) during 29 stricture dilations, a complication rate of 10% with no
      mortalities. CONCLUSION: We report the first series of TTS balloon dilations with
      or without intralesional steroid injection, of both primary and anastomotic UGI
      and LGI strictures in CD patients. Long-term success was achieved in 76.5%
      patients with a complication rate of 10%. This mode of therapy appears safe and
      effective and can be considered as an alternative to surgery in selected patients
      with medically refractory CD-associated GI strictures. Success rates were better 
      in patients who received four quadrant steroid injections. No difference was seen
      in stricture recurrence rate or complications based on diameter of TTS balloon
      used.

TI  - [Energy losses from a short bowel: not only fat].
PG  - 381-4
AB  - Two adult patients, men aged 43 and 45 years, with Crohn's disease, complicated
      by high-output small-bowel-stomy and short-bowel syndrome due to several
      intestinal resections, presented with extreme weight loss. Although both patients
      followed a high-calorie diet combining solid foods and enteral nutrition by
      nasogastric tube, containing 16,000 kJ and 21,000 kJ, respectively, weight loss
      continued. Faecal fat excretion and basal metabolic rate were determined, but
      these could not explain the caloric deficit. Therefore, faecal bomb calorimetry, 
      a measurement of total faecal energy content, was also performed, revealing a
      considerably higher faecal energy loss than had been calculated from faecal fat
      excretion; this indicates that faecal carbohydrate loss plays an important
      supplementary role. A stable weightwas achieved in both patients by prescribing
      extra food. Therefore, faecal fat excretion is an insufficient indicator of total
      faecal calorie loss in patients with high-output stomata and short-bowel
      syndrome. Bomb calorimetry may be considered as a tool to determine the remaining
      absorptive capacity in short-bowel patients.

TI  - Can we alter the natural history of Crohn disease in children?
PG  - 262-72
AB  - The natural history of Crohn disease is characterized by recurrent bouts of
      active disease, the consequences of which can severely impair sufferers' physical
      and social functioning. Not only does the illness cause day-to-day morbidity for 
      children but the consequence of the chronic inflammatory process also commonly
      results in the need for major intestinal surgery. The present challenge facing
      physicians treating children with Crohn disease is to alleviate symptoms and
      prolong periods of remission via the use of specifically targeted therapies while
      minimizing toxicity and promoting normal growth and development. Although
      systemic corticosteroids are effective in inducing clinical remission, they are
      of little or no benefit in maintaining remission and can contribute to linear
      growth retardation. Immunomodulating drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine
      and methotrexate have proved effective for inducing and maintaining remission of 
      active Crohn disease. These agents are now commonly prescribed in children at
      diagnosis, after a severe attack or after surgery or in those who become
      corticosteroid-dependent or corticosteroid-resistant. Their use is not without
      potential adverse effects and not all patients respond well to these agents. With
      the introduction of biologic agents, notably the tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      monoclonal antibody infliximab, progress has been made in targeting specific
      pathogenetic mechanisms of Crohn disease and potentially altering the underlying 
      disease process. Published experience in children is currently limited, but
      infliximab has been shown to improve symptoms and achieve corticosteroid
      independence in this age group. Unresolved issues with infliximab and other
      emerging biologic agents, including long-term safety, necessitate a degree of
      caution in selecting appropriate patients for treatment and with careful
      monitoring of their effects. The collection of contemporary natural history data 
      is crucial to facilitate the better integration of current and emerging therapies
      in an attempt to alter the natural history of Crohn disease in children.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory role of interleukin-15 in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 219-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-15 is overexpressed in intestinal tissue with active
      Crohn's disease (CD). However, its role in the pathogenesis of the disease
      remains uncertain. We studied the effects of IL-15 on colonic mucosal
      proinflammatory cytokine response in vitro using organ culture of human colonic
      explants. METHODS: Colonic tissue was obtained from (1) resections in pediatric
      CD patients (inflamed and noninflamed) and (2) rectal biopsies in patients with
      CD undergoing colonoscopy (n = 31) and controls (n = 9). In preliminary
      experiments, explants from the resections were cultured in the presence or
      absence of a simulated T(H)1 stimulation using ionomycin (Io) and
      phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA), with or without IL-15, or in medium alone.
      Rectal biopsies were cultured in the same conditions as above, with or without
      adding a monoclonal anti-IL-15 neutralizing antibody (mAb). Levels of interferon 
      (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-2R alpha were measured by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IL-15, in the absence of Io + PMA,
      did not induce the expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-2R alpha. Only
      inflamed explants from resections stimulated with Io + PMA expressed IFN-gamma,
      TNF-alpha, and IL-2R alpha. This T(H)1 stimulatory effect was inhibited by IL-15 
      in a dose-dependent fashion. In rectal biopsy explants, inflamed, noninflamed CD,
      and control tissue responded to stimulation with Io + PMA (P < 0.05) with
      increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (P < 0.05). This response was again inhibited
      by IL-15. The inhibitory effect of IL-15 was specifically reversed by anti-IL-15 
      mAb (P < 0.05). The data for the CD group were also analyzed according to the
      severity of colonic inflammation and medication use. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest a possible anti-inflammatory role for IL-15 in CD. We postulate that its 
      overexpression in CD potentially represents a protective mechanism against the
      exaggerated T(H)1 immune response.

TI  - Immunonutrition.
PG  - 216-22
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To outline recent findings on the efficacy of immunonutrients 
      in patients undergoing inflammatory stress due to surgery, infection and cancer. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Enteral nutrition is more efficacious and poses lower risks than
      parenteral nutrition. It reduces infection rates and shortens ICU and hospital
      length of stay of critically ill patients. Beneficial effects of immunonutrition 
      are most apparent in malnourished patients. Perioperative enteral nutrition is
      more effective than postoperative nutrition. In Crohn disease similar remission
      rates are achieved with enteral nutrition as with steroids. Glutamine, omega-3
      fatty acids and antioxidants exert beneficial influences in diverse patient
      populations. L-arginine is an important immunonutrient having both beneficial and
      adverse effects. The former effect occurs in necrotizing enterocolitis; the
      latter influence is seen in septic patients. The gut plays a major role in whole 
      body amino acid metabolism, particularly arginine homeostasis. Arginase and
      nitric oxide synthetase compete for arginine within immune cells and play a
      pivotal role in clinical outcome during infection. In cancer a range of
      antioxidants are able to ameliorate immunosuppression. Intravenous lipids may be 
      deleterious due to the pro-inflammatory effects of omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3
      fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and combined with medium chain triglyceride
      (MCT) and olive oil may provide a more efficacious form of intravenous lipid.
      SUMMARY: Immunonutrition is effective in improving outcome in a wide range of
      patients when applied enterally, particularly in malnourished individuals.
      Parenteral immunonutrition carries a higher risk but can be efficacious in
      selected patient groups for whom enteral nutrition is problematic.

TI  - Cigarette smoking and age at diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence and age of onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      appear to be changing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the
      prevalence of cigarette smoking differs among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) 
      or ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time of diagnosis compared with the general
      population and whether smoking history is related to the type and age of IBD
      onset. METHODS: Prevalence rates of smoking at the time of IBD diagnosis were
      compared between patients with CD and UC from the IBD Center at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center versus age-, gender-, and time period-adjusted rates in
      the Pennsylvania general population. Analyses also were stratified by gender and 
      diagnoses before and after 40 years of age, i.e., early and late onset. RESULTS: 
      There were 263 IBD patients (144 UC patients and 119 CD patients) seen in the IBD
      center between August 2000 and December 2002. The prevalence of active smoking
      was significantly higher at diagnosis in CD patients compared with the
      Pennsylvania general population (33% versus 24%, P = 0.04), particularly in those
      with CD onset at 40 years of age or later (47% versus 27%, P = 0.005). In
      contrast, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in UC patients than the
      general population (9% versus 28%, P < 0.0001), particularly among those with UC 
      onset before the age of 40 years (6% versus 27%, P < 0.0001). Smoking cessation
      was associated with an approximate, but nonsignificant, 3-fold higher likelihood 
      of late-onset UC compared with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated
      with the development of late-onset CD and is protective against developing UC at 
      any age, particularly early onset. Former smoking is associated with a high
      likelihood of developing late-onset UC, but not CD.

TI  - Impact of the increasing use of immunosuppressants in Crohn's disease on the need
      for intestinal surgery.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Immunosuppressants are now used much earlier in the course of
      Crohn's disease; however their effect on the natural history of the disease,
      especially on the need for surgery, is not known. The aim of this study was to
      assess the evolution of the need for surgery in Crohn's disease during the last
      25 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical charts of 2573 patients were reviewed
      retrospectively. The use of immunosuppressants (azathioprine or methotrexate),
      the need for intestinal resection, and the occurrence of intestinal complications
      were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis in five consecutive cohorts of patients
      defined by the date of diagnosis of Crohn's disease (1978-82; 1983-87; 1988-92;
      1993-97; 1998-2002). RESULTS: In 565 patients seen in the authors' unit within
      the first three months after diagnosis, characteristics of Crohn's disease at
      diagnosis did not differ from one cohort to another. The five year cumulative
      probability to receive immunosuppressants increased from 0 in the 1978-82 cohort 
      to 0.13, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.56 in the 1983-87, 1988-92, 1993-97, and 1998-2002
      cohorts, respectively (p<0.001). Concomitantly, the cumulative risk of intestinal
      resection remained unchanged (from 0.35 to 0.34 at five years; p=0.81). The
      cumulative risk of developing a stricturing or a penetrating intestinal
      complication remained also unchanged. Similar results were obtained in the 2008
      patients seen during the same period who were referred to us more than three
      months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although immunosuppressants have been used
      more frequently over the last 25 years, there was no significant decrease of the 
      need for surgery, or of intestinal complications of Crohn's disease.

      and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestine characterized by chronic
      inflammation of the mucosa and protean clinical manifestations caused by loss of 
      tolerance to dietary antigens. Two strongly associated cofactors have been
      identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic
      peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients
      have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease
      is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation
      of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems
      requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated
      with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly
      implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the
      disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.

TI  - Standards of medical treatment and nutrition in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 503-9
AB  - Crohn's disease is a condition of chronic inflammation potentially involving any 
      location of the alimentary tract from mouth to anus but with a propensity for the
      distal small bowel and proximal large bowel. Frequent complications include
      stricture and fistula. Numerous extra-intestinal manifestations may also be
      present. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is incompletely understood, and
      therapy, although generally effective in alleviating the symptoms, is not
      curative. Due to the heterogeneity of the disease a major need for the
      therapeutic approach is the ability to define subgroups with distinct
      characteristics. However, with regard to the heterogeneity of demographic,
      anatomic and disease behaviour characteristics, distillation of the numerous
      possible phenotypes in simple categories is a formidable task. In the present
      review the focus will be on clinically relevant situations providing therapeutic 
      algorithms according to international guidelines.
