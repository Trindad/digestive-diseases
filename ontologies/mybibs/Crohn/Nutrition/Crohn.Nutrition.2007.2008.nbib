AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genetic variations that affect innate immunity increase risk
      of ileal Crohn's disease (CD). However, the penetrance of susceptibility genes,
      including NOD2, is low, suggesting additional risk factors. Neutralizing
      autoantibodies (Ab) against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF Ab) reduce neutrophil antimicrobial function in patients with primary
      alveolar proteinosis (PAP). We investigated whether GM-CSF Ab regulates
      neutrophil function in CD. METHODS: Serum samples from 354 adult and pediatric
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were analyzed for GM-CSF Ab and
      IBD markers. Levels of GM-CSF Ab were compared with patients' CD features and
      neutrophil function. Intestinal barrier function and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced injury were assessed in GM-CSF-null and
      NOD2-null mice. RESULTS: Median GM-CSF Ab levels increased from 0.4 microg/mL in 
      control serum to 2.4 microg/mL in pediatric CD and 11.7 microg/mL in adult CD
      serum and were associated with ileal involvement (P<.001). Ileal location,
      duration of disease, and increased GM-CSF Ab levels were associated with
      stricturing/penetrating behavior (odds ratio, 2.2; P=.018). The positive and
      negative predictive values of GM-CSF Ab for stricturing/penetrating behavior were
      comparable with that of other IBD serum markers. CD patients with increased
      GM-CSF Ab had reduced neutrophil phagocytic capacity and increased accumulation
      of pSTAT3+ neutrophils in the affected ileum. GM-CSF-null mice and NOD2-null mice
      in which GM-CSF was neutralized had defects in mucosal barrier function and
      developed a transmural ileitis following NSAID exposure. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF
      regulates ileal homeostasis in CD and in mouse models. CD patients with increases
      in serum GM-CSF Ab might benefit from GM-CSF administration.

TI  - Crohn's disease phenotype, prognosis, and long-term complications: what to
      expect?
PG  - 303-7
AB  - According to Montreal classification, different phenotypes of Crohn's disease are
      defined taking into account age at diagnosis, localization of digestive lesions
      at first surgery, and cumulative anatomical behaviour. This classification is
      supported by the increased severity of the disease when diagnosed in childhood,
      the relative stability of disease localization over time, and the clinical
      importance of intestinal complications as stricture and abscess or fistula
      formation. However, type and delay of complications are dependent on disease
      localization (they develop early in small bowel disease and late in colitis),
      every patient will develop complications one day, and perianal disease may be an 
      important problem observed in up to half the patients. The percentage of patients
      with active disease every year remains stable, about 40%, after the 3 first
      years, and only a few patients have long periods of remission. Intestinal
      resections are required in the majority of patients during life, and many are
      operated on several times. Prognosis is hampered by iterative surgery, cancer and
      side-effects of treatment. Standardized mortality ratio is 1.50. Although
      occurrence of complications, need for surgery and mortality did not change
      significantly through the years 1950-2000, there are some signals suggesting that
      new therapetic strategies (immunosuppressants earlier in high risk patients) and 
      biologics will modify natural history and improve the long-term prognosis.

TI  - [Nutritional management of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 418-28
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease present higher risk for hyponutrition.
      For this reason, an adequate nutritional support is frequently needed. In these
      patients, enteral nutrition should be used unless there exist contraindications. 
      Nutritional support as the primary therapy is no indicated in adults (since
      steroidal therapy has shown to be more effective) but in the case of intolerance 
      or lack of response to medical treatment. By contrast, enteral nutrition is
      considered a first line therapy in children. There is no clear benefit with the
      use of specific formulas (modified fat, glutamine...), so that their routine use 
      is not recommended. In spite of the great technical and scientific advances,
      there are still many fields in which knowledge should be broaden; some of them
      are pointed out in this publication.

TI  - Sustained modulation of intestinal bacteria by exclusive enteral nutrition used
      to treat children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 724-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of exclusive enteral nutrition to treat paediatric Crohn's
      disease (CD) is widely accepted, although the precise mechanism(s) of action
      remains speculative. AIM: To investigate the changes to key intestinal bacterial 
      groups of Eubacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum and 
      Bifidobacteria, during and after exclusive enteral nutrition treatment for CD in 
      paediatric patients and correlate these changes to disease activity and
      intestinal inflammation. METHODS: Stool was collected from six children at
      diagnosis of CD, during exclusive enteral nutrition and 4 months post-therapy,
      and from seven healthy control children. The diversity of bacteria was assessed
      by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with changes
      to bacterial diversity measured by Bray-Curtis similarity, intestinal
      inflammation assessed by faecal S100A12 and the disease activity assessed by
      PCDAI. RESULTS: A significantly greater change in intestinal bacterial
      composition was seen with exclusive enteral nutrition treatment compared with
      controls. Further, the intestinal bacteria remained altered 4 months following
      exclusive enteral nutrition completion. Changes in the composition of Bacteroides
      were associated with reduced disease activity and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Exclusive enteral nutrition reduces bacterial diversity and initiates a sustained
      modulation of all predominant intestinal bacterial groups. Exclusive enteral
      nutrition may reduce inflammation through modulating intestinal Bacteroides
      species. The implications of these results for exclusive enteral nutrition
      therapy and CD pathogenesis should now be the subject of further investigation.

TI  - Clinical utility of the assessment of fecal calprotectin in Lesniowski-Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 622-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: From the epidemiological point of view, Lesniowski-Crohn's disease 
      (CD) has become an important medical problem. It is essential to differentiate CD
      from functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, first of all, from
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are no simple, non-invasive tests available
      which could help to identify patients with common symptoms such as abdominal pain
      or diarrhea who should be referred for further evaluation, including endoscopy.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the
      assessment of fecal calprotectin concentration in patients with CD. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Stool samples were taken from 31 patients of the Gastroenterology, Human
      Nutrition and Internal Diseases Department of Poznan Medical University who were 
      diagnosed with CD. Patients suffering from IBS served as the control group.
      Calprotectin concentration was assessed by means of the immunoenzymatic ELISA
      method. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and blood cell count were
      determined. The clinical activity of CD was assessed by means of Crohn's Disease 
      Activity Index. An appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Mean 
      calprotectin concentration in CD group was 32.01 +/- 22.58 mg/l and it was
      statistically higher (p <0.0003) than among IBS patients. A concentration of
      16.01 mg/l had 67.7% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity in distinguishing between 
      CD and IBS. There was a positive correlation between calprotectin concentration
      and CRP, and negative--with hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment
      of fecal calprotectin concentration may be useful in differential diagnoses of CD
      and monitoring patients with CD.

TI  - [Efficacy of exclusive enteral feeding as primary therapy for paediatric Crohn's 
      disease].
PG  - 506-14
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary nutritional therapy (PNT), which consists in the
      administration of exclusive enteral formula feeds (polymeric, semi-elemental or
      elemental formula) for a period of no less than 6-8 weeks, has proven to be
      effective in inducing clinical remission in children with Crohn's disease. The
      clinical remission does not always include histological remission or cure of the 
      mucosa. Faecal calprotectin is closely correlated with endoscopic and
      histological findings but is slightly associated with clinical activity scores.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational prospective study including all patients
      under 14 years of age diagnosed with Crohn's disease between January 2002 and
      October 2007, and who were fed exclusively with polymeric formula (Modulen IBD,
      Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland) during the onset of the disease. Clinical controls
      were carried out (weight, height, body mass index [BMI) and the Paediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI)) and faecal calprotectin was measured at
      the beginning and at weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. The clinical remission was
      defined as having a PCDAI less than or equal to 10. Faecal calprotectin values
      below 50 microg/g faeces were considered as normal. RESULTS: There were 14
      patients (9 males), mean age at diagnosis of 10.74 +/- 2.56 years. At week 4, 71 
      % of patients (10/14) had achieved clinical remission and a decrease in faecal
      calprotectin levels that was not significant. After 8 weeks, 85 % of our patients
      were in clinical remission and faecal calprotectin values had declined
      significantly without reaching normal levels. CONCLUSION: Primary nutritional
      therapy administered over a period of 8 weeks is capable of inducing clinical
      remission and improving the degree of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.

PG  - 31-40
LID - 10.1016/j.gcb.2008.07.007 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to test the efficacy of mesalazine in maintaining remission
      in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) following successful flare-up treatment.
      METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 122 patients
      received either mesalazine 50mg/kg per day (n=60) or placebo (n=62) for one year.
      Treatment allocation was stratified according to flare-up treatment (nutrition or
      medication alone). Recruitment was carried out over two periods, as the first
      period's results showed a trend favoring mesalazine. Relapse was defined as a
      Harvey-Bradshaw score more than or equal to 5. Time to relapse was analyzed using
      the Cox model. RESULTS: The one-year relapse rate was 57% (n=29) and 63% (n=35)
      in the mesalazine and placebo groups, respectively. We demonstrated a twofold
      lower relapse risk (P<0.02) in patients taking mesalazine in the medication
      stratum (first recruitment period), and a twofold higher risk in patients taking 
      mesalazine in the nutrition stratum (second recruitment period), compared with
      the other groups. None of the children's characteristics, which differed across
      the two recruitment periods, accounted for the between-period variation in
      mesalazine efficacy. One serious adverse event was reported in each treatment
      group. CONCLUSION: Overall, mesalazine does not appear to be an effective
      maintenance treatment in pediatric CD.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

TI  - Nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Malnutrition is a common feature in patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD), which leads to frequent infections and poor prognosis. In view of
      the rising incidence of CD in India we planned this study to assess the
      nutritional status of patients with CD. METHODS: Nutritional status of 112
      patients (mean age 35.9 [SD 11.7] years; 61 men) with CD was assessed by
      anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters. Patients were considered
      malnourished if 3 or more anthropometric parameters (% ideal body weight [IBW], %
      tricep skin fold [TSF], %mid upper arm circumference [MUAC], and % mid arm muscle
      circumference [MAMC], body mass index [BMI]) were abnormal. Dietary intake was
      assessed by a 24-hour dietary recall along with a semi-quantitative food
      frequency method. Eighty volunteers were taken as healthy controls (HC). RESULTS:
      At the time of assessment, 77 patients were in remission and 35 had active
      disease. The values of BMI, MUAC, TSF and mid arm fat area (MAFA) in patients
      were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. MAMC and mid arm muscle 
      area (MAMA) of patients and controls were comparable. TSF (Rem vs HC = 10.4
      [2.8-71] vs 16 [3-41]) and MAFA (Rem vs HC = 1236 [240-7757] vs 1858 [322-5650]) 
      of the patients in the remission phase were significantly lower than those of
      healthy controls; the remaining parameters were comparable. There was no
      difference in the dietary intake of patients in the remission and active phases, 
      and healthy controls. The percentage energy fulfillment of the patients was lower
      than that of healthy controls. Twenty-nine of 35 (82.8%) patients in the active
      and 30 of 77 (38.9%) patients in the remission phase were malnourished (OR 7.5,
      95% CI 2.8-20.4). The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 52.6% among
      patients. CONCLUSION: The percentage of malnourished patients in the active and
      remission phases of the disease was 82.8% and 38.9%, respectively, possibly due
      to low percentage energy fulfillment.

PG  - 441-50.e1; quiz 716
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.10.051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease commonly recurs after intestinal resection. We
      evaluated whether the administration of infliximab after resective intestinal
      surgery for Crohn's disease reduces postoperative recurrence. METHODS: We
      randomly assigned 24 patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone ileocolonic 
      resection to receive intravenous infliximab (5 mg/kg), administered within 4
      weeks of surgery and continued for 1 year, or placebo. The primary end point was 
      the proportion of patients with endoscopic recurrence at 1 year. Secondary end
      points were clinical recurrence and remission and histologic recurrence. RESULTS:
      The rate of endoscopic recurrence at 1 year was significantly lower in the
      infliximab group (1 of 11 patients; 9.1%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 
      13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .0006). There was a nonsignificant higher proportion of 
      patients in clinical remission in the infliximab group (8 of 10; 80.0%) compared 
      with the placebo group (7 of 13; 53.8%) (P = .38). The histologic recurrence rate
      at 1 year was significantly lower in the infliximab group (3 of 11 patients;
      27.3%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .01). The 
      occurrence of adverse events was similar between the placebo and infliximab
      groups, and none occurred in the immediate postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS:
      Administration of infliximab after intestinal resective surgery was effective at 
      preventing endoscopic and histologic recurrence of Crohn's disease.

LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2008.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn
      disease (CD), is a disorder characterized by diffuse inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract. The immune response and inflammation are mediated by
      polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. 
      This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients
      and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid
      (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma
      phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31
      healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were 
      also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD
      patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of
      linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant
      differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were
      significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared 
      with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted
      for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and
      n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators,
      were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty 
      acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with altered bone
      metabolism. This study examined changes in bone formation and resorption after
      infliximab induction and associations between bone biomarkers, linear growth, and
      disease activity (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI]) after 54
      weeks of infliximab therapy. METHODS: One hundred twelve subjects ages 6-17 years
      with moderate to severe CD received infliximab induction (5 mg/kg/dose) at weeks 
      0, 2, and 6; week-10 responders were randomized to infliximab every 8 or every 12
      weeks maintenance therapy. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP),
      N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), urine C-telopeptide of collagen 
      cross-links (CTX-1), and deoxypyrodinoline (DPD) were collected at baseline and
      10 weeks. PCDAI and height z-scores were assessed at baseline and at 10 and 54
      weeks. RESULTS: Models were adjusted for bone age, gender, height, and steroid
      use. Baseline BSAP and P1NP levels were negatively associated with PCDAI (both P 
      = .01). BSAP and P1NP increased during induction (both P < .001) and were
      associated with 54-week increases in height z-score (P < .05 and P < .001,
      respectively). Improvements in P1NP were associated with 54-week decreases in
      PCDAI (P = .01). CTX-1 and DPD also increased during induction (P < .001 and P = 
      .01, respectively) but were not associated with changes in PCDAI. Changes in
      CTX-1 were associated with improvements in height z-score (P < .002).
      CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy is associated with dramatic increases in BSAP and
      P1NP, consistent with inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha effects on
      osteoblasts. The increases in CTX-1 and DPD likely reflect coupling of bone
      formation and resorption and increases in linear growth.

AB  - In an effort to develop a molecular classification scheme for Crohn's disease
      (CD), mucosal biopsies from 69 CD patients and 28 normal controls were analyzed
      for expression of the RelA subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, A20 (a negative
      regulator of NF-kappaB), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF), and interleukin (IL)-8. Principal component analysis was used to
      classify individuals into three subsets based on patterns of biomarker
      expression. Set 1 included normal subjects and CD patients with mild disease and 
      good responses to therapy, thus defining "normal" biomarker expression. CD
      patients in set 2, characterized by low expression of all five biomarkers, had
      moderate to severe disease and poor responses to immunosuppressive and anti-TNF
      therapy. Patients in set 3, characterized by low expression of RelA, A20, and
      pIgR, normal TNF and elevated IL-8, had acute inflammation that responded well to
      therapy. Classification of CD patients by these biomarkers may predict disease
      behavior and responses to therapy.

TI  - [Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Nutrition, as a definite environmental factor, has been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although low-fiber, high-sugar,
      and high-animal fat diets have been proposed as a risk factor, the role of
      nutrition in IBD still needs more conclusive evidence. Nutritional deficiency is 
      a common problem in IBD patients. The goals of nutritional intervention are the
      prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis, and
      the promotion of optimal growth and development in childhood. Enteral nutrition
      is effective in induction and maintenance of the clinical remission in adults and
      promoting growth in children with Crohn's disease. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids contained in fish oil may provide short-term benefit to patients with IBD.

TI  - How expensive is inflammatory bowel disease? A critical analysis.
PG  - 6641-7
AB  - Economic analysis of chronic diseases is required for proper allocation of
      resources and understanding cost-effectiveness studies of new therapies. Studies 
      on health care cost of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are
      reviewed here. These studies were carried out in various countries with disparate
      health care systems. In the United States, data were often modeled or retrieved
      from large insurance schemes. Surgery and in-patient hospitalization accounted
      for over half the outlay on UC and CD. Fistulous disease in CD and parenteral
      nutrition were very costly. In Canada, overall charges were lower than in the
      United States, but there too, surgical costs were relatively high. In European
      studies, economic data were abstracted directly from patients' files. One
      pan-European study examined the outlay on UC and CD in a community-based
      prospective inception cohort followed for 10 years. Overall costs in Europe were 
      lower than in the United States. Surgery, hospitalization, year of follow-up,
      disease phenotype in CD and ASCA-positivity impacted significantly on costs. In
      all studies, the cost data were right skewed, aminosalicylates were expensive
      drugs, and biological agents the most expensive; moreover indirect costs were not
      calculated. Infliximab raised costs considerably in CD, but there were no
      long-term follow-up studies, so that the cost-benefit of biological agents
      remains unknown. In conclusion, costs of managing UC and CD vary by country,
      surgery, genotype and several other factors. The most important question for
      further research is whether the biological therapies are cost-effective in the
      long-term.

AB  - Glutamine (Gln) and arginine (Arg) are conditionally essential amino acids with
      immunomodulatory properties. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of
      Gln and Arg alone or in combination on cytokine release by cultured colonic
      biopsies from patients with active Crohn's disease (CD). Ten consecutive patients
      [mean (range) age 26 (18-39) y] with active colonic CD (mean CD activity index:
      383.7 +/- 129.8) were prospectively included in the study. Eight colonic biopsies
      were obtained via a colonoscopy and incubated during 18 h with low
      (physiological) or high (pharmacological) doses of Arg (0.1 or 2 mmol/L
      designated as Arg(low) or Arg(high), respectively) and Gln (0.6 or 10 mmol/L
      designated as Gln(low) or Gln(high), respectively). The concentrations of
      cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNFalpha), IL-1beta, interferon-gamma) were assessed by ELISA, and nitric oxide 
      (NO) production was evaluated by Griess assay. Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65
      subunit, inhibitor of NFkappaB-alpha, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK) were assessed by immunoblotting. Arg(high)/Gln(high) decreased the
      production of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-6 (each P < 0.01).
      Arg(low)/Gln(high) decreased IL-6 and IL-8 production (both P < 0.01), whereas
      Arg(high)/Gln(low) did not affect cytokine and NO production. Arg(low)/Gln(high) 
      and Arg(high)/Gln(high) decreased NF-kappaB p65 subunit expression, whereas p38
      MAPK was decreased only by Arg(high)/Gln(high). Combined pharmacological doses of
      Arg and Gln decreased TNFalpha and the main proinflammatory cytokines release in 
      active colonic CD biopsies via NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK pathways. These results
      could be the basis of prospective studies evaluating the effects of enteral
      supply of combined Arg and Gln during active CD.

      synthesis rates in pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 579-84
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may play a significant role
      in growth disturbance in pediatric Crohn disease. The aim of this study was to
      determine the effects of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on albumin and fibrinogen
      synthesis during both fasting and parenteral nutrition infusion in pediatric
      patients with active Crohn disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with active
      Crohn disease scheduled for their initial dose of infliximab underwent assessment
      immediately before and 2 weeks following infliximab infusion. Using the stable
      isotope [d5] phenylalanine, rates of fractional and absolute albumin and
      fibrinogen synthesis were calculated. Measurements were made in both the fasting 
      and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children (mean age 14.9 +/- 0.3)
      completed the study. The mean serum albumin changed from 3.59 +/- 0.08 to 3.66
      +/- 0.04 g/dL, and the mean fibrinogen level decreased from 230 +/- 17 to 187 +/-
      8 mg/dL (P < 0.05) following infliximab therapy. During fasting, there were no
      changes in albumin and fibrinogen synthesis rates following infliximab. During
      parenteral nutrition infusion, the fractional albumin synthesis rate changed from
      11.8% to 15.1%/day (P = 0.06), and the absolute albumin synthesis rate increased 
      from 192 to 248 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (P < 0.05), whereas no changes in
      fibrinogen synthesis rates were observed. Synthesis rates of albumin and
      fibrinogen were increased during parenteral nutrition infusion compared with the 
      fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: Following infliximab therapy, during parenteral
      nutrition infusion, albumin synthesis increased significantly. Conversely, serum 
      fibrinogen levels decreased following infliximab therapy in the absence of
      significant change in synthesis rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth,
      survival, and differentiation in several tissues, but its role in the
      gastrointestinal tract has not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB4
      promotes intestinal cell survival and restitution following injury or
      inflammation. METHODS: ErbB4 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease was
      determined by immunohistochemistry. Mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS, 3%) colitis or injected with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ErbB4
      expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cultured
      young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were exposed to TNF, and ErbB4 messenger
      RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels were measured. Cells transfected with
      ErbB4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or over expressing ErbB4, were subjected to 
      wound healing and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: ErbB4 levels increased in Crohn's
      colitis and the colon epithelium of mice with DSS colitis or injected with TNF.
      In YAMC cells, TNF induced ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation;
      nuclear factor kappaB activation also stimulated ErbB4 accumulation. ErbB4 siRNA 
      sensitized cells to TNF-stimulated apoptosis, while over expression blocked
      apoptosis induced by TNF plus cycloheximide. Additionally, ErbB4 siRNA decreased 
      YAMC cell wound healing. ErbB4 knockdown attenuated, while over expression
      elevated, phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF. Inhibition of the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade reversed the ability of ErbB4
      over expression to protect from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4
      expression and signaling are key elements for TNF responses in vivo and in cell
      culture, protecting intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis in the
      inflammatory environment, possibly through Akt activation.

TI  - Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease patients in northern India: frequency 
      and factors influencing its development.
PG  - 95-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often under
      nourished. Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with
      IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty,
      where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative
      colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS)
      were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical
      parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39
      (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs.
      2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73],
      p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric
      parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23
      [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001)
      and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness
      (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm
      [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though
      patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g,
      respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g,
      range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses,
      MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable
      between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between
      patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active
      disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition 
      is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.

TI  - Measurement of nutrition status in Crohn's disease patients receiving infliximab 
      therapy.
PG  - 551-6
LID - 10.1177/0884533608323421 [doi]
AB  - AIM: There is limited information on the nutrition impact of antitumor necrosis
      factor-alpha treatment in adult Crohn's disease (CD). This study was performed to
      examine the effect of a 6-month course of infliximab on enterocyte function,
      nutrient status, metabolism, and body composition in these patients. METHODS:
      Seven CD patients were assessed for disease activity, enterocyte function, and
      body composition prior to, after 6 weeks, and after 6 months of infliximab
      treatment. Measurements included (1) disease activity: Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire, Harvey Bradshaw Index, and C-reactive protein; (2) enterocyte
      function: folate, homocysteine, vitamin B(12), citrulline, vitamin D,
      beta-carotene, d-xylose absorption; (3) Prognostic Inflammatory and Nutritional
      Index (PINI); and (4) body composition and metabolism: body mass index (BMI), fat
      and lean body mass, resting energy expenditure (RRE), and respiratory quotient.
      RESULTS: Most patients had improvement in disease activity with infliximab. PINI 
      decreased in all patients (-3.35, P = .04). Plasma folate concentration
      significantly increased. There was an increase in BMI, fat mass, and lean body
      mass. The respiratory quotient increased in most patients. Changes in citrulline 
      level and REE were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients have
      improvements in an index that measures both inflammation and nutrition (PINI)
      with infliximab therapy. Increases in plasma folate suggest improvement in
      enterocyte function and/or increased oral intake. The increase in respiratory
      quotient suggests decreased lipolysis and the lack of a starvation state. It was 
      unclear whether weight gain was predominantly fat or lean muscle mass. These
      finding also support the use of PINI in Crohn's patients as an overall marker of 
      inflammation and nutrition, and as a measure of response to infliximab therapy.

TI  - Circulating adipokines and the protective effects of hyperinsulinemia in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 172-81
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.07.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with
      immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with
      insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
      circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the
      course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin,
      visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and
      inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with
      Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active
      IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy
      controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar
      in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased
      in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and
      inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding
      protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients
      with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained
      normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most
      patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r =
      -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo
      maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar
      alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD
      and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on
      relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a
      modulator in IBD.

PG  - 527-30
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0b013e31815a3920 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report and literature review. OBJECTIVES: To present a case 
      of lumbar spinal infection secondary to colonic diverticular disease, their
      management and outcome. To review the published literature on spinal involvement 
      with gastrointestinal disease with a view to establishing guidelines for
      management. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is only 1 previous case report of
      spinal involvement in diverticular disease and 9 reports of spinal infection
      secondary to Crohn disease. Psoas abscess, osteomyelitis, cord and nerve root
      compression, meningitis, and hydronephrosis have all been documented. Infection
      is usually advanced at presentation and all but 1 patient was taking
      immunosuppressive drugs. METHODS: Case notes and online databases were reviewed. 
      RESULTS: Management is similar for both Crohn and diverticular disease. Total
      parenteral nutrition and antibiotic treatment are required as is coordination
      between orthopedic surgeons, colorectal surgeons, and microbiologists. The spine 
      and abdomen are best imaged with plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging
      and contrast enhanced computed tomography. Surgery involved a defunctioning
      stoma, debridement of abdominal and spinal infection, and instrumented
      stabilization of the spine if instability or vertebral collapse is likely.
      Operative specimens are most likely to identify the multiple enteric bacteria and
      fungi involved. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach with aggressive
      supportive therapy, combined with a planned surgical procedure and appropriate
      antibiotics can give a good outcome in most cases.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Positive impact of blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha on the nutritional status
      in pediatric Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.1007/s00384-008-0578-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNFalpha seems to contribute to inflammation and malnutrition in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In CD patients, the comparative effects on
      nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been
      determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as
      compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, 
      resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents.
      METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with
      infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with
      traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD
      patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before
      follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight,
      height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food
      intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline
      weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were
      significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and
      median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P 
      < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in
      either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact
      positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight
      and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due
      to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake 
      increase.

PG  - 374-8
LID - 10.1007/s00011-007-7216-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pigmented cells, that contain inert, submicron-sized dietary
      particles, are a consistent feature of the base of human Peyer's patches (PP). We
      aimed (i) to phenotype these intestinal pigment cells (PC) in archival tissue
      specimens and (ii) to establish whether PC phenotype is altered in inflammatory
      conditions, especially Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: PCs contained within PP
      were identified by routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and dark field
      microscopy of archival ileal sections for: adenocarcinoma (n=16), colonic CD
      (n=23), non-CD colitis (n=10). Paraffin-embedded serial sections were graded for 
      microscopic inflammation and then investigated immunohistochemically with
      antibodies against CD68, MAC387, CD14, CD11b, CD15, CD1a, S100, HLA-DR, CD86 and 
      Cathepsin D. Analyses were by light and confocal microscopies. RESULTS: The
      majority of PCs were CD68 positive (circa 80%) with a minority (circa 20%)
      staining for MAC387. Microparticles were mainly identified within cathepsin D
      negative lysosomal compartments. Histological inflammatory grade and disease type
      had no influence on cell phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The microparticle-containing PCs
      of the PP base are mainly mature macrophages (CD68) of low metabolic and
      immunological activity. There is no evidence of differential PC phenotype or
      activation in differing disease states, including CD.

PG  - 566-70
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32830d3aaf [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      straightforward when alarm symptoms are present, such as bloody diarrhea and
      weight loss. When the presentation is subtle or atypical, physicians must
      determine which patients warrant evaluation for IBD. Appropriate use of
      noninvasive tests can help identify which patients should undergo further
      investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently IBD serologies lack high enough
      sensitivity and specificity to make them useful as a screening test for
      distinguishing IBD from other disorders, but they may have a role in classifying 
      subtypes of IBD. Fecal markers seem promising for helping to differentiate IBD
      from irritable bowl syndrome and for monitoring disease activity.
      Pharmacogenetically guided dosing is recommended for safe use of thiopurines but 
      ongoing routine laboratory monitoring remains important. Thiopurine metabolite
      measurement can be useful but may not be needed in all cases. SUMMARY: Primary
      care physicians should continue to rely on routine laboratory tests and clinical 
      suspicion to decide which patients with abdominal pain to refer to a
      gastroenterologist. Serology panels are not useful for IBD screening as the
      results may lead to unnecessary procedures. Although fecal markers do show
      promise as a screening test for IBD, patient resistance to providing stool
      samples may limit its usefulness in disease monitoring. Thiopurine metabolite
      levels are best used in conjunction with clinical status and routine laboratory
      tests to monitor clinical response and adverse events.

PG  - 503-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-beta 2 used as a 
      single nutrient has been shown to induce remission in 79% of children with
      Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the experience of several pediatric
      gastroenterology units in Israel using a TGFbeta2-enriched polymeric diet
      (Modulen IBD) supplementation in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 28 children with
      Crohn's disease (10 girls, 18 boys) who received, in addition to conventional
      treatment, Modulen IBD as a supplement to their regular nutrition. These children
      were compared with 18 children supplemented with standard polymeric formula
      (Ensure Plus) and 18 children without formula supplementation. We recorded
      clinical manifestations, growth, and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      before and after initiation of the polymeric diet. RESULTS: The Modulen-treated
      children showed a significant decrease in PCDAI from 34.3 to 15.7 (P< 0.0001). A 
      significant decrease in PCDAI was recorded also in the Ensure Plus group, from 35
      to 22 (P= 0.02) but not in the non-supplemented group. Significant improvements
      in body mass index (P = 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.03) were
      recorded at follow-up (median 3.4 months) only in the Modulen IBD group.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children with Crohn's disease, supplementation of 
      the diet with Modulen IBD as well as supplementation with Ensure Plus was
      associated with a decrease in PCDAI. The children supplemented with Modulen IBD
      also showed improvement in BMI, suggesting an additional advantage of nutritional
      therapy in children with this disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition in adult Crohn's disease: present status and perspectives.
PG  - 875-84
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200800093 [doi]
AB  - Enteral nutrition has long been a therapeutic alternative often used in adult
      Crohn's disease patients to obtain remission or clinical response, especially in 
      those not responding to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids. However,
      the increasing use of immunosuppressors (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine,
      methotrexate, etc.), and the advent of biotherapies (especially anti-tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies), decreased its use in adult Crohn's
      disease. Nevertheless, enteral nutrition remains of interest in patients
      presenting concomitant malnutrition (in particular in nonobstructed patients
      needing surgery), or in those intolerant or who failed to other therapeutics. In 
      addition, recent studies provide data indicating its potential interest in
      maintenance therapy in selected patients groups. Finally, future research (in
      particular in the field of immuno- or pharmaconutrition) could lead to enteral
      formula's improvement, with better tolerance and acceptability, as well as
      increased efficacy.

TI  - Perioperative treatment with infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis is not associated with an increased rate of postoperative
      complications.
PG  - 1730-6; discussion 1736-7
LID - 10.1007/s11605-008-0630-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The impact of infliximab (IFX) on postoperative complications in
      surgical patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is
      unclear. We examined a large patient cohort to clarify whether a relationship
      exists between IFX and postoperative complications. METHODS: A total of 413
      consecutive patients--188 (45.5%) with suspected CD, 156 (37.8%) with UC, and 69 
      (16.7%) with indeterminate colitis--underwent abdominal surgery at the
      Massachusetts General Hospital between January 1993 and June 2007. One hundred
      one (24.5%) had received preoperative IFX < or = 12 weeks before surgery. These
      patients were compared to those who did not receive IFX with respect to
      demographics, comorbidities, presence of preoperative infections, steroid use,
      and nutritional status. We then compared the cumulative rate of complications for
      each group, which included deaths, anastomotic leak, infection, thrombotic
      complications, prolonged ileus/small bowel obstruction, cardiac, and hepatorenal 
      complications. Potential risk factors for infectious complications including
      preexisting infection, pathological diagnosis, and steroid or IFX exposure were
      further evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients were
      similar with respect to gender (IFX = 40.6% men vs. non-IFX = 51.9%, p = 0.06),
      age (36.1 years vs. 37.8, p = 0.43), Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.3 vs. 5.7, p =
      0.25), concomitant steroids (75.3% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.79), preoperative albumin
      level (3.3 vs. 3.2, p = 0.36), and rate of emergent surgery (3.0% vs. 3.5%, p =
      1.00). IFX patients had higher rates of CD (56.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.02),
      concomitant azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine use (34.6% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.0001), and 
      lower rates of intra-abdominal abscess (3.9% vs. 11%, p < 0.05). After surgery,
      the two groups had similar rates of death (2% vs. 0.3% p = 0.09), anastomotic
      leak (3.0% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.97), cumulative infections (5.97% vs. 10.1%, p = 1),
      thrombotic complications (3.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.06), prolonged ileus/small bowel
      obstructions (3.9 vs. 2.8, p = 0.59), cardiac complications (1% vs. 0.6%, p =
      0.42), and hepatic or renal complications (1.0 vs. 0.6% p = 0.72). A logistic
      regression model was then created to assess the impact of IFX, as well as other
      potential risk factors, on the rates of cumulative postoperative infections. We
      found that steroids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, p = 0.74), IFX (OR 2.5, p = 0.14),
      preoperative diagnosis of CD (OR = 0.7, p = 0.63) or UC (OR = 0.6, p = 0.48), and
      preoperative infection (OR = 1.2, p = 0.76) did not affect rates of clinically
      important postoperative infections. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IFX was not
      associated with an increased rate of cumulative postoperative complications.

TI  - Total parenteral nutrition in treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 21-43
AB  - Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are exposed to nutritional risk.
      Malnutrition in Crohn's Disease (CD) and to a somewhat lesser in Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC) is very frequent. Depending on the severity of the disease, weight
      loss has been reported in 65% to 76% of those with CD and in 18% to 62% of those 
      with UC. The role of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is essential in very severe
      cases where enteral nutrition is not tolerated or standard drug therapy is not
      effective. Nutritional therapy is important for the correction of nutritional
      deficiency, especially in cases where elective surgical treatment is required.
      This study examined the effects of preoperative TPN administration in patients
      with IBD. Since 1990, 29 pts, 13 (44.8%) male and 16 (55.2%) female with severe
      IBD; 16 (55.2%) with UC and 13 (44.8%) with CD were treated with TPN in our
      department in the preoperative period. Evaluation of this group was compared with
      a group which was not treated with TPN preoperatively: 61 pts, 34 (55.7%) male,
      27 (44.3%) female; 50 (82%) with CD, 11 (18%) with UC. Evaluation of this group
      was compared with the group of patients who were subjected to surgical procedure 
      without prior TPN administration, in total a number of 61, of whom 34 (55.7%)
      were male and 27 (44.3%) female patients. In this group, the number of patients
      with CD and UC was 50 (82%) and 11(18%) respectively. During the course of the
      study, the following parameters were examined: Body mass index (BMI), Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI/AI), laboratory parameters and the number of hospital days. 
      The parameters were analysed before the surgical intervention, and one week and
      six months after the surgical intervention. The duration of the application of
      TPN was 12.5 +/- 5 days. The analysis of these parameters has shown that there is
      no statistically significant difference in the number of hospital days in both
      groups, which was 18.9 +/- 8.9 in the intervention group and 18.9 +/- 6.5 days in
      the control group, p = 0.9808, but analysis of the Disease Activity (CDAI/AI) has
      shown that patients who were on TPN were in a more severe stage of the disease.
      In the TPN treated group of patients none, 0 pts (0%), of the pts had no Index of
      Activity, 1.7 pts (24.1%) had Index 2 and 22 (75.9%) had Index 3. In the other
      group 3 pts (4.9%) had Index 1; 39 pts (63.9%) had Index 2 and 19 pts (31.2%) had
      Index of Activity 3. During the monitoring period of six months the activity of
      the disease was lower in patients treated with TPN. The BMI in the group of
      patients treated with TPN was lower in both sexes. It was lower than 18.4 in 7
      males and 5 females; between 18.4 and 19.9 in 2 males and 4 females; between 19.9
      and 25 in 3 males and 6 females; between 25 and 19.9 in 1 male and 1 female;
      there were no pts with BMI higher than 29.9. In the control non-TPN group, 5
      males and 3 females had BMI < or = 18.4; 2 males and 5 females had between 18.4
      and 19.9; 23 males and 13 females had between 19.9 and 25; 3 males and 5 females 
      had between 25 and 29.9 and 1 male and 1 female had BMI higher than 29.9. The BMI
      had an increasing trend in the postoperative period in both groups. The
      laboratory parameters that we examined were: number of erythrocytes and
      sedimentation, number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels, total number of
      lymphocytes, albumin level, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, electrolytes;
      sodium, potassium, calcium and serum iron, the enzymes (AP, AST and ALT); level
      of bilirubin and urea and creatinine. The results were analysed using the Tukey
      honest significant difference test (HSD), ANOVA and Student t-test. Statistically
      significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative
      period in both groups. The intergroup comparison showed significant differences
      in the level of albumin, AST, ALT and bilirubin.

TI  - Methionine synthase A2756G polymorphism may predict ulcerative colitis and
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T pancolitis, in Central China.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/1471-2350-9-78 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of genetic polymorphisms related to metabolism of
      homocysteine with inflammatory bowel disease has been evidenced in Crohn disease 
      and remains an open question in ulcerative colitis. We evaluated the association 
      of the polymorphisms of MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and TCN2 genes with ulcerative colitis
      in Central China. METHODS: 168 patients were genotyped for these polymorphisms
      and compared to 219 matched controls. RESULTS: Methionine synthase 2756G allele
      frequency was higher in ulcerative colitis than in controls 0.15 (95% C.I.
      0.11-0.19) vs 0.09 (95% C.I. 0.07 - 0.12), (P = 0.0137) and predicted ulcerative 
      colitis risk in logistic regression, with an Odds ratio at 1.8 (95% C.I.
      1.15-2.84). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype was 2.7-fold more 
      prevalent in individuals with pancolitis than in those with left colitis or
      proctitis, with respective percentages of 27.3 (95% C.I.16.4-42.0) and 10.5 (95% 
      C.I. 6.3-17.1) (P = 0.0123). The carriage of 677TT or 677CT/1298AC genotypes of
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was more frequent in cases with pancolitis
      than in subjects with left colitis or proctitis (P = 0.0048), with an Odds ratio 
      adjusted by age and sex at 3.3 (95% C.I. 1.4-7.9), P = 0.0084) in logistic
      regression. CONCLUSION: Methionine synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate
      reductase are genes of vitamin B12 and folate cellular metabolism associated
      respectively with risk and extent of ulcerative colitis, at least in Central
      China. This finding may open new insights, particularly for the potential
      interest in treating patients carrying the 677TT MTHFR genetic trait and a
      deficit in folate.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene affects
      inflammatory bowel diseases risk.
PG  - 4652-61
AB  - AIM: To investigate the role that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
      promoter of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene play in the risk of
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in a New Zealand population, in the context of
      international studies. METHODS: DNA samples from 388 patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis (IC) and 201 
      randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3
      common polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha receptor: -238 G-->A, -308 G-->A and
      -857C-->T, using a Taqman assay. A meta-analysis was performed on the data
      obtained on these polymorphisms combined with that from other published studies. 
      RESULTS: Individuals carrying the -308 G/A allele had a significantly (OR = 1.91,
      c2 = 17.36, P < 0.0001) increased risk of pancolitis, and a 1.57-fold increased
      risk (OR = 1.57, c2 = 4.34, P = 0.037) of requiring a bowel resection in UC.
      Carrying the -857 C/T variant decreased the risk of ileocolonic CD (OR = 0.56, c2
      = 4.32, P = 0.037), and the need for a bowel resection (OR = 0.59, c2 = 4.85, P =
      0.028). The risk of UC was reduced in individuals who were smokers at diagnosis, 
      (OR = 0.48, c2 = 4.86, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha is a key cytokine known 
      to play a role in inflammatory response, and the locus for the gene is found in
      the IBD3 region on chromosome 6p21, known to be associated with an increased risk
      for IBD. The -308 G/A SNP in the TNF-alpha promoter is functional, and may
      account in part for the increased UC risk associated with the IBD3 genomic
      region. The -857 C/T SNP may decrease IBD risk in certain groups. Pharmaco- or
      nutrigenomic approaches may be desirable for individuals with such affected
      genotypes.

AB  - Improvements in insulin resistance after anti-TNF-alpha therapy have been
      reported in inflammatory conditions, although no changes were noted in adult
      patients with Crohn's disease. There is no information concerning insulin
      resistance and substrate metabolism in children with Crohn's disease after
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Our aim was to describe changes in carbohydrate and lipid
      metabolism in children with active Crohn's disease after their initial dose of
      infliximab. Children with active Crohn's disease underwent measurement of plasma 
      insulin and glucose just before and 2 wk after their initial infusion of
      infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. In addition, resting energy expenditure, 
      with determination of both carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates, was
      determined. Measurements were conducted in both fasting and parenterally fed
      states. Despite no changes in resting energy expenditure, a significant reduction
      (p < 0.05) in RQ (5%) and carbohydrate oxidation rate (24%), with a corresponding
      increase in lipid oxidation rate (42%) was found during parenteral nutrition
      infusion. No differences in plasma insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance were 
      noted when comparing pre- and postinfliximab measurements.

TI  - Nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 4420-3
AB  - Nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease (CD) is an underutilised form of
      treatment in adult patients, though its use is common in the paediatric
      population. There is evidence that nutritional therapy can effectively induce
      remission of CD in adult patients. Enteral nutrition therapy is safe and
      generally well tolerated. Meta-analysis data suggest that corticosteroids are
      superior to nutritional treatment for induction of remission in active CD.
      However, the potential side effects of such pharmacotherapy must be taken into
      consideration. This review examines the evidence for the efficacy of elemental
      and polymeric diets, and the use of total parenteral nutrition in active CD.

LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e3283023be5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Infectious agents are still thought to be involved in the
      origin of inflammatory bowel disease. The focus in recent years has been more on 
      Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli or
      yeasts. RECENT FINDINGS: A metaanalysis has shown a significant association of M.
      avium subsp paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease and a large randomized
      placebo-controlled trial reported an absence of sustained beneficial effects of
      combined antibiotic therapy on remission of active Crohn's disease.
      Adherent-invasive E. coli adhere via type 1 pili to carcinoembryonic
      antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6), abnormally expressed by
      intestinal epithelial cells in Crohn's disease patients. Both colonization of the
      ileal mucosa and stimulation of ileal epithelial cells by tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha induce overexpression of CEACAM6, leading to an amplification loop
      of colonization and inflammation. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies
      are the most prevalent serologic marker in Crohn's disease. Major oligomannose
      epitopes supporting antibody formation are expressed by Candida albicans in human
      tissues, suggesting that a loss of tolerance to C. albicans could lead to
      antibody formation in a subset of Crohn's disease patients who are genetically
      predisposed. SUMMARY: M. avium subsp paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive E. coli 
      and Candida are good candidates for an infectious aetiology of Crohn's disease on
      the basis of genetic susceptibility, which relates to impaired function in the
      defence against intracellular bacteria.

PG  - 1683-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is effective for adults with moderate to severe Crohn's
      disease (CD). Data in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is sparse.
      We aim to evaluate pediatric IBD response to adalimumab. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective chart review of pediatric IBD patients treated with adalimumab. We 
      defined response as either a decrease in the disease activity index severity or
      remission after 3-6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified.
      Seven had CD, three had ulcerative colitis (UC). All had colonic disease and
      disease in either the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Eight patients initially
      responded to infliximab, 5 with CD and 3 with UC; 2 CD patients had incomplete
      data for evaluation. The mean and median times between initial infliximab and
      initial adalimumab were 29.5 and 24 months, respectively. Eight patients
      responded to adalimumab 40 mg or 80 mg biweekly, or 80 mg initial dose followed
      by 40 mg biweekly. The mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in
      CD patients before and after adalimumab were 12 and 4.2, respectively (normal
      <or=10). The mean Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) in UC patients before
      and after adalimumab were 9 and 5.1, respectively (normal <10). Corticosteroids
      were weaned off in 4/7 patients at 1 to 10 months after initiation of adalimumab.
      One patient with CD and 1 patient with UC failed adalimumab, required surgery,
      and remained on corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in pediatric
      IBD patients who become intolerant of infliximab.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anal fistulas are common in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD). We
      sought to evaluate the efficacy of oral spherical adsorptive carbon (AST-120)
      (Kremezin; Kureha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for the treatment of intractable
      anal fistulas in patients with CD. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with CD and at least one active 
      anal fistula under treatment were assigned to receive either AST-120 or placebo
      for 8 wk. Improvement was defined as a reduction of 50% or more from baseline in 
      the number of draining fistulas observed at both 4 and 8 wk. Remission was
      defined by closure of all draining fistulas at both 4 and 8 wk. The Perianal
      Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were also
      assessed. RESULTS: In total, 62 patients were randomized, of whom 57 received
      AST-120 (N = 27) or placebo (N = 30). The improvement rate in the AST-120 group
      (37.0%) was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (10.0%) (P=
      0.025). The corresponding remission rates were 29.6% and 6.7%, respectively (P=
      0.035). PDAI significantly improved at both 4 and 8 wk with AST-120, compared to 
      placebo (P= 0.004 and P= 0.005, respectively). CDAI was also significantly
      improved at both 4 and 8 wk in the AST-120 group, compared to the placebo group
      (P= 0.007 and P= 0.001, respectively). AST-120 treatment was well tolerated and
      no life-threatening adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: AST-120 is useful
      for the control of intractable anal fistulas in CD patients.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of adalimumab in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318174e886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adalimumab has recently become available for adult patients with
      Crohn disease (CD) as a viable alternative tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor 
      to infliximab. To our knowledge, there have been no studies reviewing the use of 
      adalimumab in pediatric patients with CD. Our aim was to examine the safety and
      efficacy of adalimumab therapy in pediatric patients with CD. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 15 pediatric patients with 
      CD who received adalimumab at a single institution between January 2003 and March
      2007. All of the patients had a history of an attenuated response or anaphylaxis 
      to infliximab. Each patient's chart was reviewed for age at diagnosis, sex,
      extent of disease, age at start of adalimumab therapy, course of therapy, side
      effects noted during therapy, concurrent medications, and response to adalimumab.
      Clinical response to adalimumab was classified as complete, partial, or no
      response based on the patients' ability to be weaned from steroids, increased or 
      decreased need for steroids, or need for surgery during the course of treatment. 
      This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board.
      RESULTS: Fifteen pediatric patients with CD received adalimumab for a 33-month
      period. Of those, 14 patients had adequate follow-up, and 1 patient was lost to
      follow-up. The mean age at initiation of therapy was 16.6 years (median 17.9
      years, range 10.3-21.8 years, SD 3.1 years). The majority of patients received an
      80-mg loading dose administered subcutaneously and 40-mg doses subsequently every
      2 weeks. The median duration of therapy was 6.5 months (range 1-31 months). A
      total of 272 injections were given. Of the 14 patients with sufficient data for
      follow-up, 7 (50%) had a complete response, 2 (14%) had a partial response, and 5
      (36%) had no response to adalimumab. Complete response was achieved after a
      median of 5 injections (range 3-11). Of the 14 patients with adequate follow-up, 
      5 had fistulizing disease; 3 of these maintained fistula closure, 1 had temporary
      closure, and 1 required surgery to assist with closure. Twenty-six adverse events
      occurred during therapy. Eight (57%) patients had at least 1 adverse effect. The 
      most common events were abdominal pain and nausea. No serious adverse events were
      reported, no serious infections occurred, and no adverse events required
      discontinuation of adalimumab. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab was well tolerated in
      pediatric patients with CD. Complete or partial response was observed in 64% of
      patients. No serious adverse events occurred during therapy. Additional studies
      are needed to evaluate the efficacy and to determine optimal dosing of adalimumab
      in the pediatric population with CD.

TI  - Is there a role for bowel rest in nutrition management of Crohn's disease?
PG  - 309-17
LID - 10.1177/0884533608318674 [doi]
AB  - In 1988, Greenberg and colleagues published a large randomized controlled trial
      to address whether bowel rest could lead to improved disease activity in patients
      with active Crohn's disease. The results of this study provide substantial
      evidence that bowel rest is not necessary to achieve remission in patients with
      active Crohn's disease receiving nutrition support. Before this study, great
      controversy existed about the use of nutrition support and bowel rest in the
      treatment of active Crohn's disease because of a limited number of conflicting
      studies providing evidence for and against its application. The results of the
      publication by Greenberg et al are fundamental because they helped to settle this
      important argument. Furthermore, this pivotal paper changed the clinical
      guidelines for the use of nutrition support in the management of active Crohn's
      disease. Since the publication of this pivotal article, many developments in the 
      field of nutrition and in the treatment of Crohn's disease have helped validate
      and further its results. Subsequent studies and debate center on the use of
      enteral nutrition as primary treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease.
      Data regarding the efficacy, composition, and overall role of adult enteral
      nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease are presented. This article
      revisits the Greenberg paper and discusses some of these innovations in
      nutrition.

PG  - 299-308

AB  - Nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) are intertwined because of the central role of
      nutrition in the care of patients with CD, specifically the theories regarding a 
      dietary contribution to pathogenesis and formal studies investigating the primary
      role of nutrition as therapy for CD. Perhaps one of the most important studies
      evaluating the role of nutrition therapy and bowel rest in the management of CD
      was performed by Greenberg and colleagues in 1988. This pivotal study attempted
      to define the role of bowel rest as an independent variable in the management of 
      hospitalized patients with active CD unresponsive to the traditional medical
      therapy that was available at the time. As the first randomized controlled trial 
      evaluating nutrition intervention in CD, it showed that bowel rest was not a
      major factor in achieving remission during nutrition support and did not affect
      outcome during 1-year follow-up. Although these discouraging findings would be
      subsequently replicated, the role of enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy
      would evolve during the following years as a result of insight into CD
      pathogenesis, the emergence of more effective medical therapies, and improved
      understanding of the role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD.

      case-control study.
PG  - 1730-6

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is well established that Crohn's disease (CD) is
      associated with an increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA). The data
      concerning SBA risk factors in CD are scanty. The aim of this study was to
      identify them. METHODS: In 11 French centers affiliated with the GETAID (Groupe
      d'Etude Therapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires du Tube Digestif), we
      identified 29 patients with CD and SBA. Eighty-seven CD controls without SBA
      recruited in a single center were matched to the cases for sex, age, duration,
      and CD site. A conditional logistic regression, taking into account the matching 
      between cases and controls, was performed. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the
      cases had had significantly less small bowel resection and received prolonged
      treatment with salicylates (more than 2 yr), less often than the controls (odds
      ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, CI] 0.07 [0.01-0.32] and 0.29 [0.10-0.82],
      respectively). In multivariate analysis, both associations remained significant
      (OR 0.04 [0.01-0.28], P= 0.001; OR 0.16 [0.03-0.79], P= 0.02, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests that small bowel resection and prolonged
      salicylates use may protect against SBA in CD patients.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.

TI  - Toxic megacolon in children with inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and
      radiographic characteristics.
PG  - 1524-31
LID - 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2008.01807.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxic megacolon (TMC) denotes a rare clinical syndrome accompanied by
      colonic dilatation, and is a serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This study assessed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of TMC in 
      children with IBD. METHODS: A systematic search identified patients with
      IBD-associated TMC and matched them by age to controls with ulcerative colitis
      without evidence of TMC. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with
      conditional logistic regression. Abdominal X-rays were interpreted by two blinded
      radiologists and findings were compared with controls. RESULTS: Ten children with
      TMC (median age 12.6 [7.3-15.5] yr) were matched with 20 controls (median age
      12.8 [6.8-15.2] yr). Altered level of consciousness and hypotension were rare in 
      children with TMC. Fever (P= 0.005), tachycardia (P= 0.0001), dehydration (P=
      0.01), and electrolyte abnormalities (P= 0.0002) were more common in children
      with TMC than controls. Air-fluid levels (P= 0.005), intestinal thickening (P=
      0.006), and abnormal colonic haustra (P= 0.012) were more commonly seen on X-rays
      of TMC cases. Transverse colon luminal diameter >or=56 mm was strongly suggestive
      of TMC (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%, area under the ROC curve 0.91). No
      child with TMC died and 70% required colectomy during admission. Two of the three
      with intact colons at discharge required second-line therapy during the
      subsequent year. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic dilatation >or=56 mm in children with IBD
      strongly suggests TMC, if clinical signs are present. Mental alteration and
      hypotension may be less common in children than in adults. TMC in children with
      IBD is associated with poor outcome, with a high rate of corticosteroid failure.

TI  - Malnutrition and impaired muscle strength in patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis in remission.
PG  - 694-702
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.03.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated
      nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition,
      possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone
      therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global
      assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition
      (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality
      of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33
      male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/-
      1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in
      Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47
      well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body
      mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median
      (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum
      albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell 
      mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg,
      21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip
      strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients
      with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001)
      compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in
      patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately 
      increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal
      levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM
      and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard 
      malnutrition screening.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor/lipopolysaccharides pathway in Crohn
      disease in the Jewish Ashkenazi population.
PG  - 546-50
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181653ab5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a role in the inflammatory
      process in Crohn disease, a disease with an apparent polygenic basis. We
      investigated whether polymorphisms in multiple genes involved in the
      lipopolysaccharide-TNF inflammatory pathway are independently associated with
      Crohn disease in the Jewish Ashkenazi population. Polymorphisms in CD14,
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and TNF-alpha were studied. In addition, we
      investigated polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) gene, which 
      to date has not been studied for an association with Crohn disease. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: To examine whether TLR4 Asp299Gly, CD14-260C/T, TNF-1031T/C, TNF-863C/A,
      TNF-857C/T, TACE-172C/T, and TACE-154C/A polymorphisms are associated with Crohn 
      disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, we analyzed families with at least 1 
      child with Crohn disease for association with these mutations using a
      family-based association test (transmission disequilibrium test) for analysis.
      RESULTS: The allelic frequency in the patient population of TLR4 G allele was
      8.0%, CD14 T allele was 51.3%, TNF-1031C was 18.8%, TNF-863A was 14.2%, TNF-857T 
      was 25.2%, TACE172T was 20.7%, and TACE154A was 24.5%. The transmission
      disequilibrium test transmitted:untransmitted (T:U) result for TLR4G was T:U =
      32:20, for CD14T was T:U = 103:88, for TNF-1031C was T:U = 48:56, for TNF-863A
      was T:U = 39:42, for TNF-857T was T:U = 63:62, for TACE-172C/T was T:U = 48:59,
      and for TACE-154C/A was T:U = 52:55. No statistically significant associations
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission disequilibrium test did not
      demonstrate preferential transmission of these variants in Jewish Ashkenazi
      patients with Crohn disease. These results suggest that these polymorphisms in
      the TNF/lipopolysaccharide pathway play little or no role in susceptibility to
      Crohn disease in the Jewish Ashkenazi population.

TI  - Teduglutide in intestinal adaptation and repair: light at the end of the tunnel.
PG  - 945-51
LID - 10.1517/13543784.17.6.945 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malabsorption of nutrients, fluids and electrolytes is a key finding 
      in patients with short bowel syndrome. If not compensated for by increased
      intake, it leads to diminished body stores and subclinical, and eventually
      clinical, deficiencies. Until recently, management options were limited to
      interventions aimed at provision of adequate macro- and micronutrients and fluids
      to prevent malnutrition, nutrient deficiencies and dehydration, treatment of
      associated infections and correction and prevention of acid-base disturbances.
      Identification of novel gut hormones, combined with the growing understanding of 
      their pivotal role in intestinal adaptation, has provoked interest in developing 
      more specific therapies. AIM: To provide an update on the recent advances on the 
      use of teduglutide in patients with short bowel syndrome. METHODS: A
      comprehensive Medline search using the terms teduglutide, ALX-0600, dipeptidyl
      peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and glucagon like peptide-2 (GLP-2). RESULTS: Teduglutide
      (GATTEX, ALX-0600; NPS Allelix Corp) is a synthetic DPP-IV-resistant recombinant 
      human GLP-2 analog that differs from GLP-2 only by an N-terminus substitution of 
      glycine for alanine in position 2 of the peptide that renders the component
      resistant to enzymatic degradation. Based on the results of the few Phase II
      studies and the preliminary results of a Phase III trial, teduglutide at doses of
      0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day may improve many clinical, laboratory and histologic
      abnormalities in short bowel syndrome patients. It appears to be safe and well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Teduglutide is a first-in-class therapy with the potential
      to create a new standard of care for patients suffering from short bowel
      syndrome. Future studies to address the appropriate initial and maintenance
      dosage and optimal duration of treatment are needed.

TI  - Crohn's disease: current treatment options.
PG  - 787-92
LID - 10.1136/adc.2007.128751 [doi]
AB  - There is no known cure for Crohn's disease (CD), but a better understanding of
      the evidence base of both established treatments (such as enteral nutrition,
      corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates and immunosuppressive agents) and emerging
      treatments (such as the anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha)
      agents, infliximab and adalimumab) provides opportunities to improve and maintain
      the quality of life for children with the disease. This article provides an
      overview of the evidence base of current medical treatments that are used to
      induce and maintain remission in CD. Exclusive enteral nutrition is recommended
      as the first line of treatment for the induction of remission in paediatric CD.
      Corticosteroids are also effective for inducing remission but may be associated
      with significant adverse events. Patients with chronically active CD may benefit 
      from immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and methotrexate. Infliximab
      is effective for inducing remission in patients who continue to have significant 
      active disease despite the use of conventional treatments. Adalimumab may be
      indicated for patients who develop a severe allergic reaction to infliximab or
      those who initially respond to infliximab but subsequently lose their response.
      Treatments that have been shown to be effective for the maintenance of remission 
      include azathioprine, methotrexate, infliximab and adalimumab. Recent evidence
      also suggests that long-term enteral nutritional supplementation with patients
      taking about half of their daily calorie requirements as enteral nutrition may be
      an effective strategy for the maintenance of remission in CD. The available
      evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids or 5-aminosalicylates as
      maintenance therapy for CD.

TI  - Metabolic and nutritional features in adult celiac patients.

LID - 10.1159/000116770 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten-dependent enteropathy
      induced by ingestion of gluten-containing products, characterized by intestinal
      malabsorption and subtotal or total atrophy of intestinal villi, which improves
      after gluten-free diet (GFD). Untreated patients affected by the classic form of 
      CD are at high risk of malnutrition, but an impairment of nutritional status is
      frequently reported also in patients with the subclinical form of the disease.
      Strict adherence to a GFD greatly improves nutritional status, inducing an
      increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body
      composition. A lack of improvement in nutritional status may identify incomplete 
      adherence to GFD treatment. Evidence has shown lower body weights and lower fat
      mass and fat-free mass contents in CD patients. Untreated CD patients oxidize
      more carbohydrates as energy substrate compared to treated subjects. In addition,
      circulating ghrelin concentration was reduced after GFD treatment as a possible
      consequence of body composition improvement, while leptin did not correlate with 
      the changes in body composition and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. A
      significant correlation was reported between ghrelin and the degree of severity
      of intestinal mucosal lesions. CD patients might show an alteration in lipid
      metabolism, i.e. low serum total and high- density lipoprotein-cholesterol as a
      consequence of lipid malabsorption and decreased intake. In conclusion, weight
      loss and nutritional deficiencies are relevant clinical features in CD. Thus, an 
      early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and energy metabolism
      represents a fundamental tool in the management of CD patients.

TI  - Traditional corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD006792
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006792.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, corticosteroids have been the most commonly used class 
      of medication for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Corticosteroids
      down regulate production of inflammatory cytokines and interfere with NF-kappaB
      production, thereby blunting inflammatory response. OBJECTIVES: The primary
      objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of traditional
      corticosteroids (given orally or intravenously) for induction of remission in CD.
      SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders (IBD/FBD) Group
      Specialized Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. No language restrictions were
      applied. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent
      proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings were manually searched.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled clinical trials of traditional,
      systemic corticosteroids for the induction of remission of active CD were
      included in this review. Control groups included patients receiving either
      placebo or 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA). The study population included patients of 
      any age with active CD (as defined by the study authors or validated clinical
      activity indices), receiving any formulation of systemically available
      corticosteroid by any oral or parenteral methods of delivery. The primary outcome
      was induction of remission of CD. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, 
      change in mean CDAI, adverse events and the proportion of patients withdrawing
      due to adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent
      investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed
      study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects model was chosen 
      based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were weighted using the
      DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly. Meta-analysis was 
      performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies compared
      corticosteroids to placebo and six studies compared corticosteroids to 5-ASA.
      Corticosteroids were found to be significantly more effective than placebo at
      inducing remission in CD (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.64; P < 0.00001).
      Corticosteroids were found to be more effective than 5-ASA at inducing remission 
      in studies with long follow-up duration (i.e. > 15 weeks; RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.33 to
      2.03; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids induced adverse events in a higher proportion
      of patients than placebo (RR 4.89; 95% CI 1.98 to 12.07; P = 0.0006), or low-dose
      5-ASA (RR 2.38; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.25; P = 0.003). No difference existed in the
      proportion of patients experiencing adverse events when steroids were compared to
      high-dose 5-ASA. Steroids did not induce more study withdrawals due to adverse
      events than either placebo or 5-ASA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are
      effective for induction of remission in patients with CD, particularly when used 
      for more than 15 weeks. Although corticosteroids cause more adverse events than
      either placebo or low-dose 5-ASA, these adverse events did not lead to increased 
      study withdrawal in the included studies. Further information is required to
      determine the optimal duration of treatment and tapering protocol to maximize the
      efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids. Additionally, further study is
      required to determine whether corticosteroids are more effective in patients with
      certain phenotypes or when administered intravenously.

PG  - 1125-41; discussion 1141
AB  - The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly
      beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which
      immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory
      effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been
      developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target
      segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor
      PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents.
      Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant
      transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for
      exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In
      contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy.
      Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic
      region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used 
      for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These
      drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them.
      Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring,
      especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe 
      HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is
      effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently 
      shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms 
      and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis,
      hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children
      with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have 
      a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of
      colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis
      with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications
      (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment 
      of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and
      surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient
      management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is
      judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of
      inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy
      depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature.
      Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms in human Paneth cell defensin A5 may confer
      susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease in a New Zealand Caucasian
      population.
PG  - 723-30
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2008.02.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human Paneth cell alpha-defensins, especially DEFA5, are involved in 
      maintaining homeostasis of the human microbial microflora. Since breakdown of
      normal mucosal antibacterial defence occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
      variants in the DEFA5 gene could be associated with IBD risk. SUBJECTS: A cohort 
      of 25 patients with indeterminate colitis (IC), 405 with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      and 385 with Crohn's disease (CD), were compared with 201 control individuals
      from the Canterbury region in New Zealand. METHODS: A 15 kb haplotype block
      surrounding DEFA5 contained 35 HapMap markers which were polymorphic in
      Caucasians. Four markers (A-D) were selected to tag 27 of the 35 markers at
      r(2)>0.68, and were genotyped in DNA samples. RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies
      for all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were somewhat elevated in
      patients. Subgroup analysis showed SNP A had odds ratio 1.44 in UC patients with 
      pancolitis (95% C.I. 1.07-1.94), SNP B odds ratio 2.37 in CD patients with onset 
      prior to 17 years age (95% C.I. 1.12-5.03), SNP C odds ratio 1.68 in UC patients 
      with left colonic localisation (95% C.I. 1.12-2.52), and SNP D had odds ratio
      1.56 in CD patients with one or more relatives with IBD (95% C.I. 1.03-2.35). Two
      two-marker haplotypes and one three-marker haplotype were associated with UC
      (p-values 0.025-0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SNPs genotyped in our study were
      surrogates for common variants, and observed associations between these and IBD
      status are likely due to linkage disequilibrium with a functional common DEFA5
      variant. Identifying such functional variants will be prioritized in subsequent
      work.

TI  - Is there any place for alimentary probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics, for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 906-12
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700147 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an interaction
      between genetically determined host susceptibility, dysregulated immune response,
      and the enteric microbiota. Ecological treatments including probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the
      rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in
      randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A
      probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be
      generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic 
      drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC
      (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic
      drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments.
      Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many
      questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are
      needed.

TI  - IBD in children: lessons for adults.
PG  - 528-32
AB  - When children develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), physicians and
      researchers are presented with a singular opportunity to understand the nature of
      these chronic, idiopathic illnesses in the earliest stages. Genetic
      susceptibility factors tend to be common, whereas complicating environmental
      factors such as cigarette smoking are generally not an issue. As opposed to the
      case in adult patients, Crohn's disease is usually diagnosed in children at an
      early, inflammatory phase of the disease. Pediatric ulcerative colitis tends to
      present with more severe and more extensive involvement than in adults. In both
      forms of IBD, the severity of disease activity often dictates the need for early 
      aggressive nutritional, immunomodulatory, and biologic therapy. As a result, the 
      lessons learned from the evaluation and treatment of children with IBD are
      critically important to the clinician caring for adults with the same disorders.

TI  - Esophageal, gastric, and duodenal manifestations of IBD and the role of upper
      endoscopy in IBD diagnosis.
PG  - 475-8
AB  - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease has 
      become increasingly recognized, even in the absence of specific localizing
      symptoms, as patients more frequently undergo upper endoscopy. Although the
      recent Montreal classification system allowed classification of upper GI
      involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), independent of other locations, a consensus 
      regarding the definition of what qualifies as significant "involvement" is still 
      lacking. Reported incidence data vary considerably depending on the definitions
      used and the selected target population. Pediatric data suggest that upper
      endoscopy is useful in differentiating CD from ulcerative colitis, when
      inflammation is otherwise predominantly confined to the colon; however, this
      question has yet to be studied in adults. Infliximab therapy for upper GI-CD
      seems as effective as that seen for more distal GI inflammation.

TI  - Frequency and clinical correlations of granulomas in children with Crohn disease.
PG  - 392-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31812e95e1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulomas are pathognomonic findings of Crohn disease (CD); however,
      their occurrence and clinical significance are not well characterized. Our aim
      was to determine the frequency and distribution of granulomas in untreated and
      treated patients with CD and their relation to age and disease severity. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: Records from patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy with terminal
      ileum biopsy over 7 years were reviewed. Clinical information and laboratory,
      pathology, and radiology results were recorded. The frequency and distribution of
      granulomas were determined. RESULTS: From 376 patients with CD, 75% underwent
      concurrent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Of those, 65% (184/282)
      were untreated. Granulomas were identified in 48% (136/282) of all patients and
      in 61% (112/184) of untreated patients and 24.5% (24/98) of treated patients (P <
      0.0005). The upper tract and terminal ileum biopsies were essential to the
      identification of 42% of patients with granulomas. The presence of granulomas at 
      diagnosis was related to anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies,
      hypoalbuminemia, perianal disease, and gastritis at presentation (P = 0.03, P =
      0.008, P = 0.03, and P = 0.001), respectively, and to perianal disease and
      infliximab treatment at the latest visit (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01), respectively.
      Granulomas were not related to age, sex, ethnicity, weight and height z scores,
      hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CARD15/NOD2
      mutations, abdominal surgery, or stricturing or fistulizing disease. CONCLUSIONS:
      Granulomas were identified in 61% of fully investigated pediatric patients with
      CD at diagnosis, including a substantial proportion of patients in whom
      colonoscopy to the cecum would have been insufficient for diagnosis. Granulomas
      were more frequent in untreated patients (P < 0.0005), and their prevalence was
      not affected by age. The presence of granulomas at diagnosis was associated with 
      perianal disease, gastritis, hypoalbuminemia, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibodies, and infliximab treatment.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis in
      paediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective pilot study.
PG  - 386-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31815604e5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selective granulocyte-monocyte adsorption (GMA) apheresis is a safe
      technique that has shown efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      in adult steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. GMA
      apheresis is performed with Adacolumn, a direct blood perfusion system that
      selectively adsorbs circulating granulocytes and monocytes. Studies on efficacy
      of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy, 
      safety, and tolerability of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD patients followed for
      1 year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with a mild to moderate flare-up (6
      boys, 3 girls; 5 ulcerative colitis [UC], 4 Crohn disease [CD]) were included.
      Mean age at inclusion was 13 years and 9 months, and mean disease duration before
      inclusion was 28 months. All of our patients with UC were steroid-dependent;
      patients with CD had been unsuccessfully treated with other therapies. GMA
      apheresis consisted of 5 consecutive weekly sessions lasting 60 minutes each.
      RESULTS: After the 5 sessions, 4 of 5 patients with UC and 1 of 4 patients with
      CD achieved remission. This remission was maintained in 2 of 4 patients with UC
      and in the single patients with CD. Patients taking steroids could begin to taper
      their daily doses after the second apheresis, and 3 of 5 of these patients
      reached the end of the study steroid-free. GMA apheresis was well tolerated and
      no severe side effects related to the technique were observed. CONCLUSIONS: GMA
      apheresis is a safe, well-tolerated technique in paediatric IBD. As previously
      reported, we have observed a better efficacy in promoting and maintaining
      remission, and reducing conventional drugs in patients with UC than in patients
      with CD.

TI  - Intestinal permeability and its association with the patient and disease
      characteristics in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1399-405
AB  - AIM: To assess the intestinal permeability (IP) in patients with Crohn's disease 
      (CD) and study the association of IP with the patient and disease
      characteristics. METHODS: One hundred and twenty five consecutive patients of CD 
      (Males: 66) were diagnosed on the basis of a combination of standard clinical,
      endoscopic, imaging and histological features. CD activity index (CDAI) was used 
      to calculate the activity of the disease while the behavior of the disease was
      assessed by the modified Montreal classification. IP was measured by the ratio of
      the percentage excretion of ingested doses of lactulose and mannitol in urine
      (LMR). The upper limit of normality of LMR (0.037) was derived from 22 healthy
      controls. RESULTS: Thirty six percent of patients with CD had increased IP. There
      was no significant difference in mannitol excretion (patients vs controls=12.5%
      vs 14.2%, P=0.4652), but lactulose excretion was significantly higher in patients
      compared to healthy controls (patients vs controls=0.326% vs 0.293%, P=0.0391).
      The mean LMR was also significantly higher in the patients as compared to healthy
      controls [0.027 (0.0029-0.278) vs 0.0164 (0.0018-0.0548), P=0.0044]. Male
      patients had a higher LMR compared to females [0.036 (95% CI 0.029, 0.046) vs
      0.022 (95% CI 0.0178, 0.028) (P=0.0024), though there was no difference in the
      number of patients with abnormal IP in both the sexes. Patients with an
      ileo-colonic disease had a higher LMR than those with only colonic disease [0.045
      (95% CI 0.033, 0.06) vs 0.021 (95% CI 0.017, 0.025) (P<0.001)]. Of patients with 
      ileo-colonic disease, 57.8% had an abnormal IP, compared to 26.7% with colonic
      and 15.6% with small intestinal disease. Patients with a stricturing disease had 
      significantly higher LMR compared to non-fistulising non-stricturing disease
      [0.043 (95% CI 0.032, 0.058) vs 0.024 (95% CI 0.019, 0.029) (P=0.0062)]. There
      was no correlation of IP with age, disease activity, duration of illness,
      D-xylose absorption, upper GI involvement, perianal disease, and extra-intestinal
      manifestations. On multiple regression analysis, male gender and ileo-colonic
      disease were independent factors associated with increased IP. Gender, location, 
      behavior of the disease and upper GI involvement could explain up to 23% of
      variability in IP (R2=0.23). CONCLUSION: IP was increased in 36% of patients with
      CD. Male gender and an ileo-colonic disease were the independent factors
      associated with increased IP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk of
      protein-calorie malnutrition. We sought to determine the prevalence of clinically
      diagnosable malnutrition among those hospitalized for IBD throughout the United
      States and whether this malnutrition influenced health outcomes. METHODS: We
      queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2004 to identify
      admissions for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and a
      representative sample of non-IBD discharges. We assessed the prevalence and
      predictors of malnutrition and its association with in-hospital mortality and
      resource utilization. RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition was greater in CD
      and UC patients than in non-IBD patients (6.1% and 7.2% versus 1.8%, P < 0.0001).
      The adjusted odds ratio for malnutrition among IBD admissions compared with
      non-IBD admissions was 5.57 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.29-5.86]. More IBD
      discharges than non-IBD discharges with malnutrition received parenteral
      nutrition (26% versus 6%, P < 0.0001). There was increased likelihood of
      malnutrition among those with fistulizing CD (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.50-1.82) and
      among those who had undergone bowel resection (OR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.27-1.48).
      Malnutrition was associated with increased in-hospital mortality 3.49 (95% CI:
      2.89-4.23), length of stay (11.9 days versus 5.8 days, P < 0.00001), and total
      charges ($45,188 versus $20,295, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically apparent
      malnutrition is more frequent among IBD admissions than among non-IBD admissions.
      Its association with greater mortality and resource utilization may reflect more 
      severe underlying disease that can lead to both malnutrition and worse outcomes. 
      Nonetheless, diagnosable malnutrition may serve as a clinical marker of poor IBD 
      prognosis in hospitalized patients.

LID - 10.1002/ibd.20393 [doi]
AB  - Small bowel neoplastic disease is a rare but dreaded occurrence in Crohn's
      disease (CD) and the diagnosis is often disguised by nonspecific and varied
      presenting symptoms mimicking active or obstructive CD. As such, the diagnosis is
      all too often delayed, typically detected at a late stage, and with a poor
      prognosis. CD has become a well-recognized risk factor for the development of
      small bowel adenocarcinoma. The data, however, are limited and based on case
      reports, retrospective studies, and review of the literature.

PG  - 381-3
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00632.x [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a potentially
      curative option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A rare, postoperative 
      complication is terminal ileitis which has been poorly documented in paediatric
      patients. A search of our paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database
      revealed two boys with UC who were resistant to medical therapy. They each
      underwent colectomy with IPAA. One year later, both children represented with
      bloody diarrhoea and weight loss. Several endoscopies and biopsies showed acute
      on chronic mucosal inflammation in the pouch and up to 50 cm into the terminal
      ileum (TI). Biopsies revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate with no granulomas.
      CONCLUSION: Development of terminal ileitis after colectomy and IPAA can occur in
      children with UC. Although every effort should be made to exclude Crohn's disease
      as a cause of the terminal ileitis, this poorly defined condition should not be
      considered to be against the diagnosis of UC. More research is needed to develop 
      a better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of this uncommon condition.

TI  - Treatment of diarrhea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: concepts and
      cautions.
PG  - S3-10
AB  - Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that
      physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient
      symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status.
      Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity
      of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as
      medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile).
      When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using
      appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other 
      medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures 
      of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For 
      iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and
      individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same;
      therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. 
      Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with
      known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or 
      abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and
      atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.

TI  - Screening for celiac disease in short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malabsorptive diarrhea due to short bowel syndrome (SBS) results in
      nutrition compromise, often requiring parenteral nutrition (PN). Activation of
      latent celiac disease can occur after gastrointestinal surgery. Our objective was
      to determine whether undiagnosed celiac disease contributes to malabsorption in
      patients with SBS. METHODS: Adult subjects with SBS were tested for celiac
      disease using immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody and
      total IgA level. Subjects with an elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase were
      offered upper endoscopy with biopsies of the duodenum. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects
      were enrolled. The subjects were predominantly white, and the most common cause
      of SBS was Crohn's disease. The mean length of remaining small bowel was 93.1 +/-
      54.6 cm. All subjects had undergone surgeries, resulting in loss of the ileocecal
      valve. Five subjects were found to have an elevated total IgA. A single patient
      was found to have an elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody, and
      subsequent endoscopy demonstrated active gastroduodenal Crohn's disease, without 
      features of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: No subjects were IgA deficient, but 5
      subjects were found to have elevated IgA levels. Undiagnosed celiac disease did
      not contribute to malabsorption in our small cohort of predominantly white SBS
      patients. Larger studies are warranted.

TI  - Managing Crohn disease in children and adolescents : focus on tumor necrosis
      factor antagonists.
PG  - 31-8
AB  - Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract characterized by a relapsing course and variable presentation that often
      includes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. CD frequently presents during
      childhood, resulting in pediatric-specific complications, such as growth failure 
      and delayed puberty. Conventional drug therapy for moderate to severe pediatric
      CD includes induction of remission with corticosteroids, and maintenance of
      remission with immunomodulators. Patients who have an inadequate response to
      standard therapy are being increasingly treated with anti-tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNFalpha) agents. Infliximab has been the most widely studied
      anti-TNFalpha agent in pediatric CD, and has been shown to be efficacious in this
      condition. Adalimumab has been proven to be efficacious in adults with CD, but
      there has been only a single case report in children. CDP571 has been tested in
      20 children with CD, showing some efficacy. Finally, thalidomide therapy has been
      associated with improvement in two small case series. Toxicities of these agents 
      include infusion reactions, infections, malignancies, neurologic disorders, and
      hematologic derangements.

TI  - Dietary patterns and risk for Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 367-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits),
      whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease 
      (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent. METHODS: We postulated that
      specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was
      carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based
      controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada.
      Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire
      (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional
      logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary
      patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 
      95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 149 cases 
      and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3
      (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were
      observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats,
      fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI
      1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by
      vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely
      associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 
      95% CI 0.1-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns 
      could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger
      prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

TI  - Serum ghrelin levels in inflammatory bowel disease with relation to disease
      activity and nutritional status.
PG  - 2215-21
AB  - Ghrelin possesses various biological activities -- it stimulates growth hormone
      (GH) release, plays a major role in energy metabolism, and is one of the hormones
      that affects body composition. It also plays a role in modulating immune response
      and inflammatory processes. In this study we aimed to determine whether serum
      ghrelin levels had correlation with markers associated with disease activation.
      We also investigated any probable relationship between serum ghrelin level and
      nutritional status. Serum levels of ghrelin and its relationship with disease
      activity and nutritional status were evaluated in 34 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC), 25 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 30 healthy controls.
      Serum ghrelin levels, serum IGF-1 and GH levels, and markers of disease activity 
      (sedimentation, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) were measured in all
      subjects. Body composition and nutritional status was assessed by both direct (by
      anthropometry) and indirect (by bioimpedance) methods. Serum ghrelin levels were 
      significantly higher in patients with active UC and CD than in those in remission
      (108 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. 71 +/- 13 pg/ml for UC patients, P < 0.001; 110 +/- 10
      pg/ml vs. 75 +/- 15 pg/ml for CD patients, P < 0.001). Circulating ghrelin levels
      in UC and CD patients were positively correlated with sedimentation, fibrinogen
      and CRP and was negatively correlated with IGF-1, BMI, TSFT, MAC, fat mass (%),
      and fat free mass (%). This study demonstrates that patients with active IBD have
      higher serum ghrelin levels than patients in remission and high levels of
      circulating ghrelin correlate with the severity of disease and the activity
      markers. Ghrelin levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients show an
      appositive correlation with IGF-1 and bioelectrical impedance analysis, body
      composition, and anthropometric assessments. Finally, we arrived at the
      conclusion that ghrelin level may be important in determination of the activity
      in IBD patients and evaluation of nutritional status.

TI  - Differential clustering of bowel biopsy-associated bacterial profiles of
      specimens collected in Mexico and Canada: what do these profiles represent?
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Bowel commensals appear to be an important source of antigens that drive the
      chronic immune inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis [inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)]. Biopsy-associated bacteria are
      assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD
      because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to 
      immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections
      associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing
      and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico
      City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities
      were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster
      according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be
      differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples 
      obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly 
      similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least 
      in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that
      pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.

AB  - We report a patient with Crohn's disease who suffered several generalized
      convulsions. He was studied with cerebral image techniques and neurophysiologic
      tests without getting the aetiology of the convulsions. A severe depletion in
      magnesium levels was suspected at the time of the initial evaluation by the
      Nutritional Team Group. Low serum magnesium levels were confirmed in the first
      blood test. Convulsions disappeared when magnesium was normalised by intravenous 
      infusion. It is necessary for specialist physicians to be on the alert of severe 
      complications of nutrients deficiency and that this kind of patients should be
      checked by the Nutrition Team.

TI  - Systematic review: nutritional therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 293-307
AB  - BACKGROUND: At least 25% of individuals diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) have 
      onset of disease in childhood. Almost all children with CD have nutritional
      impairments, such as weight loss or stunting, at diagnosis or subsequently.
      Nutritional therapy (exclusive enteral nutrition) is established as a valid and
      effective treatment in paediatric CD. The advantages of this approach are
      induction of remission and control of inflammatory changes, mucosal healing,
      positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status, and avoidance of
      other medical therapies. AIM: To provide a comprehensive up-to-date review of the
      roles of nutritional therapy in CD and of the data supporting this therapy.
      METHODS: A search of PubMed was performed with search terms 'enteral nutrition', 
      'nutritional therapy', 'Crohn disease' and 'children'. Relevant articles were
      selected from this search. In addition, the reference lists of available articles
      were reviewed for further relevant articles. RESULTS: Nutritional therapy offers 
      numerous benefits in the management of CD. Recent work has begun to elucidate the
      likely mechanisms of this therapy. These include direct mucosal anti-inflammatory
      effects and alteration of intestinal microflora. CONCLUSION: Further studies are 
      required to define longer-term effects of nutritional therapy in patients with
      CD.

TI  - Methotrexate following unsuccessful thiopurine therapy in pediatric Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 2804-12; quiz 2803, 2813
AB  - BACKGROUND: The thiopurines, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are traditional
      first-line immunomodulatory agents in adult and pediatric Crohn's disease, but
      the comparative efficacy and safety of methotrexate have seldom been examined. We
      report outcomes with methotrexate treatment in pediatric patients previously
      refractory to or intolerant of thiopurines. METHODS: In a four-center,
      retrospective cohort study, efficacy of methotrexate in maintaining remission was
      assessed by PCDAI measurements, steroid use, and height velocity. Patients served
      as their own historical controls. Multivariable analysis controlled for route of 
      methotrexate administration, reason for thiopurine discontinuation, baseline
      disease activity, and disease duration. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of 60 children
      treated with methotrexate were in clinical remission without steroids at both 6
      and 12 months. A strong steroid sparing effect was observed compared with the
      year prior to methotrexate (P<0.001). Success rates were similar in previously
      thiopurine-intolerant and refractory patients. Height velocity increased from
      -1.9 SDS to -0.14 SDS (P=0.004) in the year following therapy. In a median 3-yr
      follow-up, a third of the patients did not require escalation of therapy; the
      others required step-up therapy with infliximab or surgery. Eight children (13%) 
      stopped methotrexate due to adverse events, including, most commonly, elevated
      liver enzymes, and one serious episode of sepsis. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate
      appears effective in maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease, when
      thiopurines have failed. Consideration should be given to its use earlier in
      pediatric treatment algorithms.

      disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in
      CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant
      dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its
      relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies
      to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and
      antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined.
      RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA
      antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the
      control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly
      higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05).
      Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD
      patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% 
      of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies
      including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific
      antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a 
      significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the
      inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA
      antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.

TI  - Alterations in the function of circulating mononuclear cells derived from
      patients with Crohn's disease treated with mastic.
PG  - 6031-6
AB  - AIM: To assess the effects of mastic administration on cytokine production of
      circulating mononuclear cells of patients with active Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: The study was conducted in patients with established mildly to
      moderately active CD, attending the outpatient clinics of the hospital, and in
      healthy controls. Recruited to a 4 wk treatment with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 
      g/cap) were 10 patients and 8 controls, all of who successfully completed the
      protocol. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte
      chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and
      intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) were evaluated in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after treatment. RESULTS: Treating CD
      patients with mastic resulted in the reduction of TNF-alpha secretion (2.1 +/-
      0.9 ng/mL vs 0.5 +/- 0.4 ng/mL, P = 0.028). MIF release was significantly
      increased (1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL vs 2.5 +/- 0.7 ng/mL, P = 0.026) meaning that random
      migration and chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages was inhibited. No significant
      changes were observed in IL-6, MCP-1 and GSH concentrations. CONCLUSION: This
      study shows that mastic acts as an immunomodulator on PBMC, acting as a TNF-alpha
      inhibitor and a MIF stimulator. Although further double-blind, placebo-controlled
      studies in a large number of patients is required to clarify the role of this
      natural product, this finding provides strong evidence that mastic might be an
      important regulator of immunity in CD.

TI  - Dietary microparticles and their impact on tolerance and immune responsiveness of
      the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - S59-63
AB  - Dietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the
      gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate)
      or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg
      (10(12)) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through
      exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste
      constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass
      through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions 
      and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive
      such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary
      microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction
      (adsorption) of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides,
      peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal flora. The major
      (but not only) sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the M-cell
      rich lymphoid aggregates (termed Peyer's patches in the small bowel). Indeed, it 
      is well established that this is an efficient transport route for non-biological 
      microparticles although it is unclear why. We hypothesise that this pathway
      exists for "endogenous microparticles" of calcium phosphate, with immunological
      and physiological benefit, and that "exogenous dietary microparticles", such as
      titanium dioxide and the silicates, hijack this route. This overview focuses on
      what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune
      tolerance of the gut (endogenous microparticles) or immune activation (exogenous 
      microparticles) and inflammation of the gut.

TI  - [Osteopenia in patients with Crohn disease].
PG  - 920-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis and osteopenia are frequently reported during chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly in Crohn disease (CD). AIM: To
      determine the frequency of osteoporosis and osteopenia of patients with CD and to
      study associated risk factors. METHODS: A forward-looking study was performed
      about 56 cases of CD, 34 men and 22 women, aged 32 + 10.4 years (18-54 years),
      with no other disorders affecting osseous metabolism. A biphotonic X-rays
      absorptiometry densitometry (DEXA) was performed at femoral neck and lumbar
      spine. A multivariate statistical analysis was performed to check for risk
      factors in osseous mineral density. RESULTS: Osteoporosis and osteopenia are
      noticed with respective frequency of 35.7 % and 23.2 %. A statistically
      significant association is found between low osseous density on one hand and
      physical mass index (IMC), localisation on large bowel of the disease and
      corticotherapy on the other hand. The IMC was a risk factor independent from the 
      two other factors. Under nutrition, with IMC < 18 kg / m C, was observed at 21
      patients. It was associated to a pathological densitometry in 76.2 % of cases,
      versus 48.6 % in patients having an IMC > 18 kg/m (p = 0.03, Odds ratio = 3.4).
      CONCLUSION: Among risk factors involved in the osteoporosis during CD, the
      nutritional status plays an important role which must be taken into account in
      the treatment of these patients.

TI  - [Socioeconomic and nutritional profile of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease at a university hospital].
PG  - 99-106
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases include chronic and relapsing
      inflammatory disorders, represented by ulcerative proctocolitis and Crohns
      disease, commonly associated with malnutrition. AIM: Characterize the nutritional
      and socioeconomic profile of patients hospitalized at the Pernambuco "Hospital
      das Clinicas", Recife, PE, Brazil. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out at 
      the gastroenterology clinic, which was previously approved by the Ethics
      Commission for studies involving human beings. The methods included clinical
      history data, socioeconomic conditions and nutritional assessment. Data were
      subject to statistical analysis (Students t test for equal and unequal
      variables). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 24 male and female patients, with a 
      mean age of 43.83 +/- 16.13 years, mostly married, coming from Recife, with low
      income, who lived in their own house with relatives. We found a higher prevalence
      of ulcerative proctocolitis (62.5%), with diagnosis time of more than 5 years,
      symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody-mucous diarrhea with 6-9 evacuations/day, with
      the distal colon being the most affected part. Osteoporosis was present in 26.7% 
      of cases. Nutritional status was assessed through the body mass index. The weight
      loss percentage corresponded to 41.7% and 70.8%, respectively, classified as
      malnourished, associated or not with high prevalence levels of anemia,
      hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia. Gender correlation evidenced higher triceps
      fold and arm circumference values in men. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the study
      limitations, data suggest relevant information about the occurrence of these
      diseases in the northeast of Brazil, as well as about its frequent association
      with important nutritional deficiencies.

TI  - Improvement of lumbar bone mass after infliximab therapy in Crohn's disease
      patients.
PG  - 637-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a high risk of developing
      osteoporosis, but the mechanisms underlying bone mass loss are unclear. Elevated 
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), have 
      been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone resorption. AIM: To assess whether
      suppression of TNFalpha with infliximab treatment has a beneficial effect on
      lumbar bone mass. METHODS: Adult CD patients who had received infliximab
      treatment, and who underwent lumbar densitometric evaluation before and during
      treatment, were selected. Adult CD patients who had never received infliximab
      treatment were selected as controls. Information regarding age, sex, weight,
      duration of CD, use of glucocorticoids and bisphosphonates, and signs of disease 
      activity between both densitometric measurements were collected. RESULTS: Data
      from 45 patients were analyzed. The control group (n=30, mean [+/- SD] 26.7+/-9
      years of age) had a significantly higher increase in body weight between both
      evaluations (6.26%+/-8%) than the infliximab group (n=15, 30.6+/-13 years), which
      had an increase of 0.3%+/-7.4%. There was a strong correlation between the final 
      weight and lumbar bone mineral content (BMC) in both groups. The infliximab group
      had a significant increase in lumbar bone area (4.15%+/-6.6%), BMC
      (12.8%+/-13.6%) and bone mineral density (8.13%+/-7.7%) between both evaluations 
      (interval 22.6+/-11 months) compared with the control group. The increase in BMC 
      in patients who had received infliximab treatment was significant when compared
      with control patients who had received glucocorticoids (n=8) or had evidence of
      disease activity (n=13). CONCLUSION: Infliximab therapy improved lumbar bone mass
      independent of nutritional status. This finding suggests that TNFalpha plays a
      role in bone loss in CD.

TI  - Recent advances in the medical therapy of Crohn's disease in childhood.
PG  - 2553-68
AB  - Crohn's disease (CrD) is characterised by an ongoing inflammatory response in the
      gut, in the absence of an obvious trigger. The treatment of CrD in children,
      during relapse and remission, requires special consideration of growth and
      development. This review addresses the use of present medical management
      strategies, including enteral nutrition, corticosteroids, immunosuppression and
      anti-TNF-alpha therapies. Anti-inflammatory IL-11 and leukocyte adhesion
      inhibitors have shown only moderate clinical efficacy in adults. Emerging
      treatments directed against the inflammatory cascade under investigation include 
      inhibitors of IL-6 and -12, IFN-gamma and MAPKs. Probiotics and colony
      stimulating factors aim to stimulate the innate immune system. Research data from
      clinical trials are reviewed and summarised in respect of their potential within 
      paediatric practice.

TI  - Association of MTRR 66A>G polymorphism with superoxide dismutase and disease
      activity in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 399-406
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of nutritional 
      (folate, vitamin B12) and genetic (MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, TCN) determinants of
      homocysteine metabolism and of superoxide dismutase with Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: One hundred forty patients with CD were compared with 248 matched
      healthy controls. RESULTS: Plasma homocysteine levels were higher in CD patients 
      than controls (11.8 vs 10.4 micromol/L, P= 0.0004). Vitamin B12 and folate levels
      were lower in CD subjects compared to controls (207 vs 255 pmol/L, P= 0.0082, and
      8.6 vs 11 nmol/L, P= 0036, respectively). Patients with a personal history of
      ileal resection, ileitis, or colectomy had significantly lower vitamin B12
      levels. In multivariate analysis, vitamin B12 and MTHFR 677 TT carriers were the 
      two significant independent factors of plasma homocysteine >15 micromol/L in CD
      patients (P= 0.0187 and 0.0048, respectively). The significant association
      between homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels remained significant only in patients
      with the highest superoxide dismutase values (P < 0.0001). The MTRR AA genotype
      was a significant independent predictor of CD risk (odds ratio 3.7, 95% CI
      1.218-11.649, P= 0.0213). The level of superoxide dismutase was significantly
      higher (P= 0.0143) and was correlated with Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 
      scores (P for trend = 0.0276) in patients carrying MTRR AA genotype. CONCLUSIONS:
      Vitamin B12 and MTHFR 677 TT genotype are the main determinants of
      hyperhomocysteinemia in CD patients. The association of MTRR 66A>G polymorphism
      with oxidant stress and disease activity provides rationale for screening vitamin
      deficiencies in these patients.

TI  - Nutrigenomics in the whole-genome scanning era: Crohn's disease as example.
PG  - 3105-18
AB  - Nutrigenomics has the potential to tailor diets to optimize health, based on
      knowledge of key genetic polymorphisms. Identification of candidate genes is
      often based on a priori knowledge of disease processes. However, genome-wide
      association methods are not only validating previously identified genes and
      polymorphisms, but also revealing new gene-disease associations not anticipated
      from prior knowledge. In Crohn's disease (CD), such studies not only confirm the 
      importance of caspase-activated recruitment domain 15 and major
      histocompatibility complex II molecules, but also reveal strong associations with
      the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23 receptor and autophagy-related
      16-like gene. Genes identified to date in CD can be linked into two interrelated 
      pathways: receptor-mediated cytokine induction or autophagocytosis. New genomic
      technologies need to be matched with innovative methodologies to characterize the
      likely impact of foods and to take the field to another dimension of value for
      human diet development and optimized health.

TI  - Review article: the evidence base for interventions used to maintain remission in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is characterised by recurrent flare-ups alternating
      with periods of remission. A number of interventions are currently used in
      clinical practice to try and maintain remission in Crohn's disease but the
      evidence base for some of them may be questionable. AIM: To review the available 
      evidence on interventions, which are currently used to maintain remission in
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: The Cochrane Library and Medline (Pubmed) were searched
      for level 1 evidence on specific interventions. Search terms included 'Crohn's
      disease or synonyms', 'remission or synonyms' and the names of specific
      interventions. RESULTS: Azathioprine, infliximab and adalimumab are effective at 
      maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Natalizumab is also effective, but
      there are concerns about its potential association with progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy. Long-term enteral nutritional supplementation,
      enteric-coated omega-3 fatty acids and intramuscular methotrexate may also be
      effective but the evidence for these is based on relatively small studies. The
      available evidence does not support the use of oral 5-aminosalicylates agents,
      corticosteroids, anti-mycobacterial agents, probiotics or ciclosporin as
      maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the
      evidence base of existing interventions could result in the use of treatments,
      which are more likely to lead to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Impact of sleep disturbances in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1748-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Normal sleep is paramount for a healthy lifestyle and high quality of
      life. Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several
      chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the
      role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The 
      aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated
      measures of sleep and quality of life. METHODS: A self-administered, mail-in
      questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The
      questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 
      a measure of disease severity and the IBD-Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total 
      of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: The IBD subjects
      reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation,
      higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day-time energy, increased
      tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The
      abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The
      reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score (r(2) =
      0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease
      status were correlated. CONCLUSION: The results show that IBD patients have
      significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem
      might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and
      might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare-up.
      Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance 
      should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.

TI  - The prevalence and geographic distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis in the United States.
PG  - 1424-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous US studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      prevalence have sampled small, geographically restricted populations and may not 
      be generalizable to the entire nation. This study sought to determine the
      prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a large
      national sample and to compare the prevalence across geographic regions and other
      sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed the health insurance
      claims for 9 million Americans, pooled from 87 health plans in 33 states, and
      identified cases of CD and UC using diagnosis codes. Prevalence was determined by
      dividing the number of cases by the number of persons enrolled for 2 years.
      Logistic regression was used to compare prevalence estimates by geographic
      region, age, sex, and insurance type (Medicaid vs commercial). RESULTS: The
      prevalence of CD and UC in children younger than 20 years was 43 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 40-45) and 28 (95% CI, 26-30) per 100,000, respectively. In
      adults, the prevalence of CD and UC was 201 (95% CI, 197-204) and 238 (95% CI,
      234-241), respectively. The prevalence of both conditions was lower in the South,
      compared with the Northeast, Midwest, and West. IBD appears to be more common in 
      commercially insured individuals, compared with those insured by Medicaid.
      CONCLUSIONS: This estimation of the prevalence of IBD in the US should help
      quantify the overall burden of disease and inform the planning of appropriate
      clinical services.

TI  - Impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease
      activities and mucosal cytokines during remission in patients with Crohn's
      disease: a prospective study.
PG  - 1493-501
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic
      remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective
      study was to investigate the impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical
      and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with
      quiescent CD. METHODS: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission
      were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion
      during the nighttime and a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20
      received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). With
      these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further,
      ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies 
      were taken for cytokine assays. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 5
      patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non-EN group had a clinical
      relapse during the 1-year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic
      inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at
      both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in 
      the non-EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal
      tissue interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels
      significantly increased with time in the non-EN group (entry versus 12 months,
      IL-1beta, P = 0.02; IL-6, P = 0.002; TNF-alpha, P = 0.001). In the EN group these
      cytokines did not show a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term enteral
      nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on
      clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine 
      levels.

TI  - Resting energy expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 342-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is controversy in the literature regarding the effect of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on resting energy expenditure (REE). In many
      cases this may have resulted from inappropriate adjustment of REE measurements to
      account for differences in body composition. This article considers how to
      appropriately adjust measurements of REE for differences in body composition
      between individuals with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Body composition, assessed
      via total body potassium to yield a measure of body cell mass (BCM), and REE
      measurements were performed in 41 children with Crohn disease and ulcerative
      colitis in the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Log-log regression
      was used to determine the power function to which BCM should be raised to
      appropriately adjust REE to account for differences in body composition between
      children. RESULTS: The appropriate value to "adjust" BCM was found to be 0.49,
      with a standard error of 0.10. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, there is a need to adjust
      for differences in body composition, or at the very least body weight, in
      metabolic studies in children with IBD. We suggest that raising BCM to the power 
      of 0.5 is both a numerically convenient and a statistically valid way of
      achieving this aim. Under circumstances in which the measurement of BCM is not
      available, raising body weight to the power of 0.5 remains appropriate. The
      important issue of whether REE is changed in cases of IBD can then be
      appropriately addressed.

TI  - Aluminum is a potential environmental factor for Crohn's disease induction:
      extended hypothesis.
PG  - 329-45
AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a common environmental compound with immune-adjuvant activity
      and granulomatous inflammation inducer. Al exposure in food, additives, air,
      pharmaceuticals, and water pollution is ubiquitous in Western culture. Crohn's
      disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically
      susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental
      factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor
      for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD
      incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent.
      Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: 
      increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or
      dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity,
      promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic,
      oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting
      intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis
      induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial
      interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive 
      immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction
      and maintenance.

TI  - Meta-analysis: enteral nutrition in active Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 795-806
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists surrounding the optimal treatment for inducing
      remission in active Crohn's disease. AIM: To review and update evidence on the
      effectiveness of enteral nutrition (EN) in treating active Crohn's disease in
      children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (up to February 2007)
      were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to Crohn's disease
      and EN in children. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs (n = 394). Seven RCTs (n = 204) 
      compared EN with corticosteroid therapy. On the basis of pooled results of four
      RCTs (n = 144), we found no significant difference in the remission rates between
      groups (relative risk, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.7-1.4, random effect model). Four RCTs
      (n = 190) compared two EN regimens. One of the four RCTs (n = 50) revealed a
      significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving remission in the
      total EN group compared with the partial EN group (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1-7.4). Because
      of lack of data, formal pooling of results was not possible for many outcomes
      (e.g., time until remission, duration of remission, growth data). CONCLUSIONS:
      Limited data suggest similar efficacy for EN and corticosteroids. As the number
      of patients needed to provide a definite answer is too large, future studies
      should focus on detailed outcome measurements including growth and quality of
      life.

TI  - Adequacy of nutritional intake in a Canadian population of patients with Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 1575-80
AB  - Crohn's disease is frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, often a
      result of disease activity and poor oral intake. This study investigated the
      adequacy of dietary intake, based on the Canadian Dietary Reference Intake, in
      ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease and a normal body mass index (BMI;
      calculated as kg/m(2)). This was a cross-sectional study of 74 patients with mean
      age of 35.7+/-1.4 years and BMI of 23.05+/-0.45. All patients completed a 7-day
      food record and a diary for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Mean Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index was 138.99+/-11.38. Energy and protein intakes were within
      the recommended levels of intake, but total carbohydrates, fat, and saturated fat
      intake exceeded the recommended levels of <55%, <35%, and <10% in 39.2%, 27%, and
      59.5% of the patients, respectively. Micronutrient intakes were suboptimal most
      notably for folate, vitamins C, E, and calcium. There were no substantial
      differences between patients with active and inactive disease in terms of failure
      to meet the Dietary Reference Intake. In conclusion, in this population sample, a
      large number of ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease have suboptimal dietary 
      patterns despite a normal BMI and inactive disease. Dietary counseling and
      supplementation may be warranted in this patient population.

TI  - ["Fast-track" and elective, laparoscopic colo-rectal surgery].
PG  - 342-8; discussion 348-9
AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of this prospective clinical evaluation was to investigate
      the influence of "Fast-track"-treatment in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      colorectal operations and its effect on morbidity, hospital stay and recovery.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bowel cleaning under enteral hypercaloric nutrition
      (Biosorb Energie, Fa. Nutricia, Germany) was achieved with Fleet (Ferring
      Arzneimittel, Germany) one day prior to surgery. A peridural catheter was placed 
      preoperatively. Intraoperative electrolyte substitution should not exceed 12
      ml/kg KG/h. In case of decreasing intraoperative blood pressure
      hydroxyethylstarch 6% was substituted. The nasogastric tube was removed
      immediately after the operation, the urinary catheter was removed on the first
      postoperative day. The patients stayed on the intermediate care department for
      one night and started already there with oral feeding and mobilisation (for 2 h).
      The following days mobilisation increased to 4 h daily under normal enteral
      nutrition without infusions. RESULTS: Between June 2003 and January 2006, 147
      patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were included in this study.
      Diverticulitis (n = 114), malignant tumors of the sigmoid colon (n = 6) or rectal
      cancer (n = 13), colonic adenomas (n = 5), stenotic Crohn's disease (n = 4) and
      small bowel carcinoid (n = 1), rectal prolaps (n = 1) and elongated colon
      sigmoideum (n = 4) were indications for surgical treatment. Laparoscopic sigmoid 
      resection (n = 117), left hemicolectomy (n = 11), ileocecal resection (n = 8),
      anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (n = 9), abdomino-perineal
      exstirpation (n = 1) and anterior-segmental resection of the rectum (n = 1) were 
      performed. Drainages were removed on the 2nd, peridural catheter on the 3rd
      postoperative day. Defecation occurred in all patients until the 2 (nd) postop.
      day. Early postoperative complication rate was 15% (22/147 patients) without
      mortality. 8 patients (5%) with anastomotic leakage were reoperated. The mean
      hospital stay was 6 days. The re-admission rate was 3% (4/147 patients) and
      included one patient with anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSION: "Fast-track"-treatment
      in combination with minimal-invasive surgery is a safe and comfortable
      perioperative treatment for patients with elective colorectal operations.

TI  - Skeletal muscle wastage in Crohn's disease: a pathway shared with heart failure?
PG  - 219-27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lean body mass wastage in active Crohn's disease is not only related 
      to malnutrition, but also to local and systemic inflammation. Altered bowel
      permeability can represent a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that have been
      shown to produce muscle wastage by several mechanisms such as apoptosis. In our
      study we have evaluated the body composition and the pathological changes of
      skeletal muscle in patients with Crohn's disease to see whether a relationships
      between altered gut permeability, proinflammatory cytokines production and muscle
      wastage existed. METHODS: Thirteen consecutive steroid-free patients with active 
      Crohn's disease underwent evaluation of body composition, sugar test for
      intestinal permeability, determination of serum levels of TNF-alpha, sphingosine,
      bacterial lipopolysaccaride, and biopsy of gastrocnemius. In bioptic samples we
      determined fibres cross sectional area, distribution of myosin heavy chains and
      apoptosis. Twenty healthy subjects formed the control group. RESULTS: In patients
      lean body mass was reduced and intestinal permeability increased (p<0.01 for
      both). TNFalpha, sphingosine and lipopolysaccaride were increased (p<0.01).
      Fibres size was reduced (p<0.01), with shift of Myosin Heavy Chains from the slow
      to the fast type. Apoptosis was found in 5 patients' biopsies, never in controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's patients have a myopathy characterized by myocyte apoptosis,
      modifications of myosin and muscle atrophy. TNF-alpha and sphingosine, that are
      increased because of the enhanced lipopolysaccaride concentration due to altered 
      gut permeability, may play a pathophysiological role in the development of this
      myopathy.

TI  - Mucosal T-cell immunoregulation varies in early and late inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1696-705
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease is a life-long form of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) mediated by mucosal immune abnormalities. Understanding of the
      pathogenesis is limited because it is based on data from adults with chronic
      Crohn's disease. We investigated mucosal T-cell immunoregulatory events in
      children with early Crohn's disease. METHODS: Mucosal biopsies and T-cell clones 
      were derived from children experiencing the first attack of Crohn's disease,
      children with long-standing Crohn's disease, infectious colitis, and children
      without gut inflammation. RESULTS: As in acute infectious colitis, interleukin
      (IL) 12 induced T cells from early Crohn's disease to acquire a strongly
      polarised T helper (Th) type 1 response characterised by high IFN-gamma
      production and IL12Rbeta2 chain expression. Th1 polarisation was not induced in
      clones from late Crohn's disease. Mucosal levels of IL12p40 and IL12Rbeta2
      messenger RNA were significantly higher in children with early than late Crohn's 
      disease. These results demonstrate that susceptibility to IL12-mediated
      modulation is strongly dependent on the stage of Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: At
      the onset of Crohn's disease mucosal T cells appear to mount a typical Th1
      response that resembles an acute infectious process, and is lost with progression
      to late Crohn's disease. This suggests that mucosal T-cell immunoregulation
      varies with the course of human IBD. Patients with the initial manifestations of 
      IBD may represent an ideal population in which immunomodulation may have optimal 
      therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - A comprehensive approach to evaluate nutritional status in Crohn's patients in
      the era of biologic therapy: a case-control study.
PG  - 2551-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the nutritional status of patients with inactive or mildly
      active Crohn's disease (CD), and identify possible causes for potential
      deficiencies. METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were
      evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles
      factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies.
      Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P=
      0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8%
      and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free
      mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was 
      decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD
      patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily
      intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D,
      E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet,
      28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a
      significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the
      exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E
      (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01)
      and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat
      mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most
      prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which
      was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly
      related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.

TI  - Evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: 
      a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 307-15
AB  - Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a
      state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human
      studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction
      of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive
      therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been
      investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. 
      The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is
      persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative
      colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less
      convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic,
      prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of
      patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one
      treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence
      from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role
      of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the
      clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD005984
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's
      disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the
      maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its
      prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs 
      may cause significant adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review 
      to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in
      Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to
      January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the
      Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials 
      Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand
      searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral
      nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were
      eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and
      assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently
      performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical
      or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two 
      studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the 
      review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible
      because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed
      greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who
      received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the
      remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to 
      patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 
      95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric
      feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in
      addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of
      remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 
      0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests
      that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of
      remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these
      findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an
      alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Association of variants of the interleukin-23 receptor gene with susceptibility
      to pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 972-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently an association was shown between the single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11209026, within the interleukin-23 receptor
      (IL23R) locus and Crohn's disease (CD) as a consequence of a genome-wide
      association study of this disease in adults. We examined the effects of this and 
      other previously reported SNPs at this locus with respect to CD in children.
      METHODS: By using data from our ongoing genome-wide association study in our
      cohort of 142 pediatric CD patients and 281 matched controls, we investigated the
      association of the previously reported SNPs at the IL23R locus with the childhood
      form of this disease. RESULTS: By using the Fisher exact test, the minor allele
      frequency of rs11209026 in the patients was 1.75%, whereas it was 6.61% in the
      controls, yielding a protective odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% confidence interval,
      0.10-0.65; 1-sided P = 9.2 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, of all the SNPs previously
      reported, rs11209026 was associated the most strongly. A subsequent family based 
      association test (which is more resistant to population stratification) with 65
      sets of trios derived from our initial patient cohort yielded significant
      association with rs11209026 in a transmission disequilibrium test (1-sided P =
      .0017). In contrast, no association was detected to the caspase-recruitment
      domain 15 gene for the inflammatory bowel disease phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The OR 
      of the IL23R variant in our pediatric study is highly comparable with that
      reported previously in a non-Jewish adult inflammatory bowel disease case-control
      cohort (OR, 0.26). As such, variants in the IL23R gene confer a similar magnitude
      of risk of CD to children as for their adult counterparts.

TI  - Surgical management of Crohn's colitis.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - Crohn's disease in childhood is changing. The incidence is increasing, colonic
      disease is becoming more prevalent in younger children, and colon reconstruction 
      is more acceptable. Genetic phenotypes are influencing decisions for surgery, and
      targeted immunotherapy has renewed hope for more durable remissions following
      less extensive resections. The tasks facing the surgeon evaluating a child with
      Crohn's colitis include confirming the specific diagnostic subtype and selecting 
      the correct procedure. This chapter will review the unique aspects of pediatric
      Crohn's colitis and the increased complexity of surgical choice for this most
      challenging presentation. Recent success with less extensive surgery offers
      renewed hope for children with intractable colonic disease.

TI  - [Current status of inflammatory bowel disease treatment].
PG  - 298-300
AB  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease should take some general considerations
      into account, standing out among them the importance of nutrition, antithrombotic
      prophylaxis in certain situations, prevention of osteoporosis and prevention of
      colorectal cancer by endoscopic screening in extensive ulcerous colitis or
      Crohn's colitis. Ulcerous colitis is still effectively treated with salicylates
      and steroids in its mild and moderate forms. Severe forms require parenteral
      steroids, cyclosporine or infliximab, and these are successfully used with
      immunosuppressants (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) in steroid dependence.
      Maintenance with salicylates, that should be adequately complied with, is an
      important point. Crohn's disease is treated with steroids in its mild and
      moderate forms, and again in corticodependent ones with immunosuppressants, which
      we are using increasingly sooner. Refractory forms or fistulous forms benefit
      from the use of biological treatments (infliximab) generally accompanied by
      immunosuppressants.

TI  - Moderate dietary temperance effectively prevents relapse of Crohn disease: a
      prospective study of patients in remission.
PG  - 202-10
AB  - The authors examined the influence of diet (dietary fat intake and dietary
      temperance) on relapse of patients with Crohn disease. A 1-year prospective study
      of 76 patients with Crohn disease was conducted. The criterion for eligibility
      was a Crohn Disease Activity Index score of 150 or lower for at least 1 month.
      The primary end point was defined as the relapse-free interval from the baseline 
      until the first relapse. Fat intake was assessed using a validated diet history
      questionnaire. The degree of dietary temperance was assessed using a single-item 
      nominal scale. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the
      influence of diet. Crohn disease relapse was seen in 25 patients (33%), and 47
      patients (62%) remained in continuous remission. A decreased ratio of n-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3PUFA (odds ratio = .38; p = .005) was
      associated with a poor prognosis. Dietary temperance also was significantly
      associated with prognosis (p = .014). More moderate dietary temperance decreased 
      the risk of relapse (odds ratio = .22; p = .006). Effective prevention of relapse
      for Crohn disease patients might be achieved through moderate dietary temperance,
      particularly when the disease condition is unstable.

TI  - Infliximab dose intensification in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1093-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) patients who lose response to infliximab may
      benefit from an increase in dose or decrease in interval between infusions. The
      aims of this study were to determine the proportion of CD patients who require
      dose intensification and factors associated with dose intensification. METHODS:
      All CD patients who received at least 8 doses of infliximab at the University of 
      Pittsburgh infusion center were included in an analysis to determine the need for
      dose intensification. Dose intensification was defined as either an increase in
      infliximab dose, a decrease in interval, or both. Factors were analyzed for
      association with dose intensification during follow-up. RESULTS: Between 2002 and
      2005 there were 108 CD patients who received at least 8 infliximab doses. At 30
      months from initial infusion, 69.1% were event-free from an interval decrease,
      48.5% from a dose increase, and 45.7% from any dose intensification. Of the 54
      patients who received dose intensification, 75.9% were able to regain response
      and remained on infliximab. The 30-month event-free rates did not differ by
      whether the patient had received prior infliximab therapy (P=0.49), had a lapse
      of more than 6 months between infusions (P=0.75), or were on concomitant
      immunomodulators (P=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of CD patients
      on long-term infliximab treatment lose response and require an increase in dose
      and/or decrease in infusion interval. The majority of these patients regain
      response with dose intensification. Every-8-week maintenance infusions and
      concomitant immunomodulators did not alter the rate of infliximab dose
      intensification.

TI  - Does polymeric formula improve adherence to liquid diet therapy in children with 
      active Crohn's disease?
PG  - 767-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active Crohn's disease can be treated using liquid diet therapy
      (LDT), but non-adherence may limit success, necessitating corticosteroid therapy.
      Whole-protein polymeric formula (PF) seems to be much more palatable than amino
      acid-based elemental formula (EF) and thus may significantly improve adherence to
      LDT. AIM: To compare adherence to LDT using PF versus EF. METHODS: Success in
      completing a 6-week course of LDT, need for nasogastric tube administration of
      formula and use of LDT for relapses were compared between children presenting
      with active disease and treated with EF (n = 53) and children given PF (n = 45). 
      RESULTS: Remission rates were similar (EF 64%, 95% CI 51 to 77 vs PF 51%, 95% CI 
      37 to 66; p>0.15). 72% (95% CI 60 to 84) given EF completed the initial course of
      LDT compared with 58% (95% CI 44 to 72) given PF (p = 0.15). Of those failing to 
      complete the initial course, 13% on EF and 16% on PF gave up by choice
      (non-adherence), the remainder stopping due to treatment failure. Nasogastric
      administration was more frequent with EF (55%, 95% CI 42 to 68) compared to PF
      (31%, 95% CI 17 to 45) (p = 0.02). Among those treated successfully at first
      presentation, LDT was used for 28% of relapses in the EF group (95% CI 12 to 44) 
      and 39% in the PF group (95% CI 19 to 59) (p>0.2) over the next year. CONCLUSION:
      PF did not effect adherence to LDT but was associated with significantly reduced 
      need for nasogastric tube administration of formula.

TI  - Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young
      adults: report of a working group of the North American Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the Crohn's and Colitis
      Foundation of America.
PG  - 653-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have varied in 
      the criteria used to classify patients as having Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative
      colitis (UC), or indeterminate colitis (IC). Patients undergoing an initial
      evaluation for IBD will often undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including
      barium upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, abdominal
      CT, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy with biopsies. Other tests performed less
      frequently include magnetic resonance imaging scans, serological testing, and
      capsule endoscopy. The large amount of clinical information obtained may make a
      physician uncertain as to whether to label a patient as having CD or UC.
      Nevertheless, to facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies in children,
      to allow the entry of children into clinical trials, and to allow physicians to
      more clearly discuss diagnosis with their patients, it is important that
      clinicians be able to differentiate between CD and UC. METHODS: A consensus
      conference regarding the diagnosis and classification of pediatric IBD was
      organized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The meeting included 
      10 pediatric gastroenterologists and 4 pediatric pathologists. The primary aim
      was to determine the utility of endoscopy and histology in establishing the
      diagnosis of CD and UC. Each member of the group was assigned a topic for review.
      Topics evaluated included differentiating inflammatory bowel disease from acute
      self-limited colitis, endoscopic and histological features that allow
      differentiation between CD and UC, upper endoscopic features seen in both CD and 
      UC, ileal inflammation and "backwash ileitis" in UC, patchiness and rectal
      sparing in pediatric IBD, periappendiceal inflammation in CD and UC, and
      definitions of IC. RESULTS: Patients with UC may have histological features such 
      as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, histological gastritis, periappendiceal
      inflammation, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis.
      These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to
      CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental
      colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and multiple granulomas
      in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD. An algorithm
      is provided to enable the clinician to differentiate more reliably between these 
      2 entities. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations and algorithm presented here aim to 
      assist the clinician in differentiating childhood UC from CD. We hope the
      recommendations in this report will reduce variability among practitioners in how
      they use the terms "ulcerative colitis," "Crohn disease," and "indeterminate
      colitis." The authors hope that progress being made in genetic, serological, and 
      imaging studies leads to more reliable phenotyping.

TI  - Disease presentation and clinical course in black and white children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 555-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the disease presentation, disease phenotype, and clinical 
      course between black and white children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 10-year retrospective review was undertaken of the
      medical records of 245 pediatric patients with IBD studied at a tertiary care
      center. RESULTS: In this patient population 24% were black and 76% were white.
      There were no differences between black and white patients in terms of anatomic
      distribution of IBD, symptom presentation, and extraintestinal manifestations. A 
      family history of IBD (36.4% vs 17.5%; P = 0.006) was more common in white
      children. Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate of black patients with Crohn
      disease was higher at diagnosis compared with whites (P < 0.001) and a greater
      proportion of African Americans presented with a body mass index z-score less
      than -2 (P < 0.009). At 12 months following diagnosis 22.5% of African American
      children had a hemoglobin level lower than 10 g/dL compared with 4.3% of whites
      (P = 0.001). African Americans had evidence of more complicating stricturing and 
      penetrating Crohn disease behavior (51.3% vs 27.4%; P = 0.006). African Americans
      received significantly more corticosteroids and infliximab to treat their IBD
      compared with whites (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that for
      pediatric IBD, there may be racial differences in prevalence of family history
      and in disease phenotype.

TI  - Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD006320
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) 
      have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and
      safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH STRATEGY:
      The following databases were searched from their inception without language
      restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished 
      data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for
      maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients
      of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were
      followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3
      given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were
      balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and
      secondary outcomes were change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse 
      and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators
      reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality
      using Jadad's criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2 software,
      weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method. Random or fixed effect models were used
      according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to
      address heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies were eligible for inclusion.
      There was a non statistically significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintaining 
      remission (RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.4 to 1.03; P = 0.07). However, the studies were both 
      clinically and statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.01, I(2) = 72%). Three studies 
      used enteric coated capsules (positive effects) and one ordinary gelatin capsules
      (no advantage). Subgroup analyses of studies which used enteric coated capsules
      revealed a statistically significant benefit for maintenance of remission (RR
      0.49; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.69; RD 0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.43); number needed to treat 
      to prevent relapse in 1 year was 3 (95% CI 2 to 5; I(2) = 19%). However, the
      total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 166). No
      significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough
      data were available to analyze the other secondary outcomes. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Omega 3 fatty acids are safe and may be effective for maintenance of
      remission in CD when used in enteric coated capsules. However, there are not
      sufficient data to recommend the routine use of n-3 for maintenance of remission 
      in CD. The small number of patients in the included studies warrants further
      larger RCTs.

TI  - Evaluation of densitometric bone-muscle relationships in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1610-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are 1.4 to 2.5 times more likely
      than the normal population to sustain a fracture but the factors involved in the 
      pathogenesis are not clearly understood. Bone mass is affected both by nutrition 
      and by muscular activity. Trauma excepted, the largest voluntary loads on bones
      come from muscle contraction, not body weight. AIM: To assess the relationship
      between bone mass (bone mineral content) and muscle mass (lean mass) in CD
      patients. METHODS: Adult CD patients who had had a whole body, lumbar and hip
      densitometric evaluation were selected. Information regarding age, gender,
      weight, duration of CD, age at diagnosis, use of glucocorticoids and disease
      activity during the year before densitometric evaluation and laboratory
      parameters were collected. RESULTS: Data from 65 patients (28.8+/-10.6 years,
      F=44, M=21) were analyzed. Lumbar bone mineral content (BMC), BMC in both hips,
      total and regional BMC significantly correlated with body weight and total and
      regional lean mass (LM). In multiple regression analysis, only total LM was shown
      to be independently associated with lumbar BMC, BMC in both hips and total BMC.
      LM in upper and lower limbs was shown to be independently associated with BMC in 
      upper and lower limbs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      muscular mass and activity, rather than overall body weight, are important
      determinants of bone mass and, hence of bone strength in Crohn's disease. Thus,
      the management of bone loss in inflammatory bowel disease should address the
      effects of both nutrition and exercise on muscle mass.

TI  - Impact of enteral supplements enriched with omega-3 fatty acids and/or omega-6
      fatty acids, arginine and ribonucleic acid compounds on leptin levels and
      nutritional status in active Crohn's disease treated with prednisolone.
PG  - 10-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often develop malnutrition due to 
      disease activity. We aimed to assess the effect of two different enteral
      supplements of Impact(R) Powder (IP; Novartis, Switzerland) on leptin levels and 
      nutritional status in active CD patients during prednisolone treatment and
      tapering. METHODS: Thirty-one CD patients were randomized to IP Extra (group 1)
      or IP Standard (group 2). Leptin levels, nutritional, clinical and biochemical
      markers were studied at inclusion, after 5 and after 9 weeks of the study.
      RESULTS: Leptin levels, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol increased
      significantly within both groups at week 5 compared to inclusion. Leptin levels
      correlated with BMI in both groups at inclusion and in group 2 at week 9. In
      group 1, triglyceride levels remained unchanged, while levels in group 2
      increased significantly at week 5 compared to inclusion. Clinical and biochemical
      markers improved during the study compared to inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Increased
      leptin levels during the study progress were transient, decreasing due to
      prednisolone withdrawal at the end of the study. Both formulas used as adjuvant
      therapy to prednisolone treatment were able to improve nutritional status in CD
      patients.

TI  - Gender differences in body composition deficits at diagnosis in children and
      adolescents with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1121-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with poor growth and
      decreased body mass index (BMI); however, lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM)
      deficits prior to therapy have not been characterized. OBJECTIVES: To quantify LM
      and FM in incident pediatric CD subjects and controls, and to identify
      determinants of LM and FM deficits. METHODS: Whole body LM and FM were assessed
      using DXA in 78 CD subjects and 669 healthy controls, ages 5-21 yr. Gender
      specific z-scores for LM (LM-Ht) and FM (FM-Ht) relative to height were derived
      using log linear regression models in the controls. Multivariate linear
      regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: CD was associated 
      with significantly lower height and BMI for age. Within CD subjects, FM-Ht and
      LM-Ht were significantly lower in females compared with males (FM-Ht z:
      -0.66+/-0.83 vs. -0.08+/-0.95, p<0.01; LM-Ht z: -1.12+/-1.12 vs. -0.57+/-0.99,
      p<0.05). In females, CD was associated with significantly lower LM-Ht (p<0.001)
      and FM-Ht (p=0.001), adjusted for age, race and Tanner stage, compared with
      controls. LM and FM deficits were significantly greater in older females with CD;
      47% of adolescent females had LM-Ht<or=5th percentile. In non-black males, CD was
      also associated with lower LM-Ht (p<0.02); FM-Ht deficits were not significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: Incident CD was associated with significant LM deficits in males and
      females, and FM deficits in females. Future studies are needed to identify
      etiologies for the age and gender differences and to evaluate therapies for these
      deficits.

TI  - Wireless capsule endoscopy in the pediatric age group: experience and
      complications.
PG  - 516-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) provides a unique 
      opportunity to visualize the entire small bowel in a minimally invasive manner.
      Studies in adult patients have demonstrated that the disposable capsule is well
      tolerated and highly effective, but few studies have been done in children. The
      aims of our study were to compare the diagnostic yield of CE and small bowel
      series in children being evaluated for possible small intestine disease and to
      determine the risk of developing an adverse event following capsule endoscopy.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children who
      underwent CE at 1 institution between August 2002 and July 2005. Results of CE
      were compared with those of small bowel radiographic studies when available.
      RESULTS: There were 46 CE studies from 45 patients, 28 male and 17 female, with a
      mean age of 14.9 +/- 3.6 years and mean weight of 49.7 +/- 17.5 kg. The
      indications for CE included unresponsive Crohn disease (n = 16), possible
      intestinal polyps (n = 11), unexplained iron deficiency anemia (n = 7), growth
      failure (n = 5), unresponsive ulcerative colitis (n = 3), persistent abdominal
      pain (n = 1), protein-losing enteropathy (n = 1), and allergic enteropathy with
      occult gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1). Of the 46 CE studies, 41 were completed
      and 5 were incomplete studies. Based on the CE, 9 patients were newly diagnosed
      with Crohn disease, 9 patients with Crohn disease were newly diagnosed with small
      bowel involvement, 8 patients had upper intestinal polyps, 1 patient had findings
      consistent with Menetrier disease, and 1 had a duodenal ulcer. Thirty-three
      patients had small bowel series before CE: 24 studies were normal, 6 had abnormal
      thickening of the small bowel, 2 had polyps, and 1 patient had antral narrowing. 
      All 9 patients with abnormal small bowel series had abnormal CE studies. Of the
      24 patients with normal small bowel series, 20 had completed CE studies, and in
      10 children, the study was abnormal. Nine of the 45 subjects had adverse events. 
      Five patients had delayed passage from the stomach, with 2 needing endoscopic
      retrieval of the CE, and 4 had delayed passage from the small intestine (>5
      days), with 2 requiring surgical removal, 1 responding to steroids, and the final
      patient requiring an ileocolic resection 2 months after the CE for an undiagnosed
      ileal stricture. The only significant association noted was that older patients
      were more likely to have intestinal retention. CONCLUSIONS: CE provides a
      valuable tool in the evaluation of pediatric patients for possible small bowel
      disease. However, the risk of developing complications appears to be greater in
      the pediatric population, with 20% of our patients having an adverse event.

TI  - Small bowel capsule endoscopy: a systematic review.
PG  - 274-80
AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy offers a revolutionary diagnostic tool for small bowel
      diseases. Since its formal introduction, it has become an integral part of the
      diagnostic evaluation for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. This relatively
      noninvasive imaging modality offered by small bowel capsule endoscopy is
      appealing to both patients and providers and consequently, the desire to expand
      its diagnostic role continues to grow. The use of CE in the diagnosis of Crohn
      disease and chronic diarrhea is being further investigated, as is the potential
      of employing this technique as a cancer surveillance mechanism in patients with
      hereditary polyposis syndromes which may involve the small bowel. This review
      article discusses the current indications for small bowel capsule endoscopy, the 
      results of capsule endoscopy in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding
      and small bowel diseases, and patient outcomes following capsule endoscopy.
      Capsule endoscopy is compared with traditional diagnostic modalities, including
      small bowel series, enteroclysis, CT, and push enteroscopy. Small bowel capsule
      endoscopy is the procedure of choice to evaluate obscure gastrointestinal
      bleeding, and is superior to radiographic procedures in detecting Crohn disease
      of the small bowel.

TI  - Clinical perspectives in Crohn's disease. Turning traditional treatment
      strategies on their heads: current evidence for "step-up" versus "top-down".
PG  - S17-22
AB  - The current Crohn's disease treatment algorithm involves a "step-up" approach in 
      which conventional medications such as corticosteroids are given first and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) agents are reserved for refractory cases.
      Although this approach may seem to be cost-efficient, recent studies have shown
      that "top-down" therapy using anti-TNF-a agents in newly diagnosed patients
      improves long-term rates of mucosal healing, a therapeutic endpoint that
      correlates with reduced hospitalizations and surgeries, thereby reducing overall 
      costs and enhancing patients' quality of life. Another reason the step-up
      approach has been favored over the top-down is concern about side effects;
      however, a multivariate logistic regression analysis of patients treated with or 
      without infliximab showed no differences in mortality, serious infections, or
      malignancies between the 2 groups. Moreover, newer anti-TNF-a agents, such as
      adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, have the potential to reduce the risk of
      immunogenicity and the associated infusion reactions and loss of response, as
      well as reducing autoimmunity associated with infliximab therapy. The potential
      advantages of "reversing" our current therapeutic pyramid/algorithm for the
      treatment of Crohn's disease include early disease stabilization and disease
      modification, minimization of complications such as strictures and fistulae that 
      lead to the need for surgery, reduction of postoperative recurrence, and
      avoidance of the ubiquitous complications of corticosteroid therapy.

TI  - NOD-like receptors and human diseases.
PG  - 648-57
AB  - NOD-like receptors are cytosolic proteins that contain a central
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NACHT), an N-terminal effector-binding
      domain and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). NOD-like receptors have been
      implicated as ancient cellular sentinels mediating protective immune responses
      against intracellular pathogens. Recent studies have described the genetic
      association of polymorphisms in NOD-like receptor genes with complex chronic
      inflammatory barrier diseases, such as Crohn's disease and asthma and with rare
      auto-inflammatory syndromes including familial cold urticaria, Muckle-Wells
      syndrome and Blau syndrome. Whereas genetic variability in NLRs may have been an 
      important element to provide plasticity to antigen recognition and host defense
      in the past, recent changes in the lifestyle of industrialized societies (e.g.
      hygiene ("cold-chain-hypothesis"), nutrition, or antibiotics) may have turned
      ancient genetic variability into disease-causing mutations. The review focuses on
      NLR function in the molecular pathophysiology of human inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Nutrition issues in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 214-22
AB  - Twenty-five percent of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnoses present in
      childhood, with Crohn's disease (CD) being the most common type. Many children
      have poor nutrition status at presentation of the disease, which may worsen
      during the clinical course, with a significant number of children having impaired
      linear growth. The cause of this poor nutrition status is complex, and
      contributing factors include inadequate intake, malabsorption, altered energy
      demands, and losses through stool, particularly in colitis. The principal aim of 
      medical management is to induce disease remission, with minimal side effects,
      thereby enabling normal growth and development. This must include active
      consideration of the nutrition needs of such children and how they may be best
      met. However, our understanding of the manner in which the disease process
      affects the energy demands of children with CD or how poor nutrition, in turn,
      may affect the disease course is limited. This may constrain the efficacy and
      effectiveness of standard therapeutic approaches to care. This review explores
      the many factors of relevance in the delivery of nutrition support to children
      with inflammatory bowel disease, and explores the role of exclusive enteral
      nutrition as a corticosteroid-sparing strategy to induce remission in children
      with active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Differential protein expression profile in the intestinal epithelium from
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1114-25
AB  - The loss of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) function is a critical component in 
      the initiation and perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation in the
      genetically susceptible host. We applied proteome analysis (PA) to characterize
      changes in the protein expression profile of primary IEC from patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Surgical specimens from 18
      patients with active CD (N = 6), UC (N = 6), and colonic cancer (N = 6) were used
      to purify primary IEC from ileal and colonic tissues. Changes in protein
      expression were identified using 2D-gel electrophoreses (2D SDS-PAGE) and peptide
      mass fingerprinting via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) as well as Western blot 
      analysis. PA of primary IEC from inflamed ileal tissue of CD patients and colonic
      tissue of UC patients identified 21 protein spots with at least 2-fold changes in
      steady-state expression levels compared to the noninflamed tissue of control
      patients. Statistical significance was achieved for 9 proteins including the
      Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha that was up-regulated in CD and UC patients.
      Additionally, 40 proteins with significantly altered expression levels were
      identified in IEC from inflamed compared to noninflamed tissue regions of single 
      UC (N = 2) patients. The most significant change was detected for programmed cell
      death protein 8 (7.4-fold increase) and annexin 2A (7.7-fold increase). PA in
      primary IEC from IBD patients revealed significant expression changes of proteins
      that are associated with signal transduction, stress response as well as energy
      metabolism. The induction of Rho GDI alpha expression may be associated with the 
      destruction of IEC homeostasis under condition of chronic intestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - Acute effects of enteral nutrition on protein turnover in adolescents with Crohn 
      disease.
PG  - 356-60
AB  - Adults with inactive Crohn disease have been shown to have normal rates of
      protein turnover when compared with healthy adults. It is not known whether this 
      is true for adolescents with inactive Crohn disease, when rate of protein
      synthesis must be greater than that of breakdown for normal development. The
      objective of this study was to determine whether enteral nutrition acutely
      suppresses proteolysis and increases protein synthesis in adolescents with
      inactive Crohn disease. Six adolescents (five males/one female; mean age, 15.8
      +/- 1.9 y; range, 13.2-17.6 y; mean bone age, 14.6 +/- 1.8 y; range, 12.5-17 y)
      participated. Leucine (Leu) and phenylalanine (Phe) kinetics were measured using 
      stable isotopes under fasted and fed conditions during a single study visit. In
      response to enteral nutrition, the endogenous rates of appearance (Ra) of Leu and
      Phe (reflecting proteolysis) decreased significantly by 40%. The percentages of
      splanchnic uptake of Leu and Phe were 35 +/- 10% and 13 +/- 12%, respectively.
      Under fed conditions, utilization of Phe for protein synthesis increased
      significantly. We conclude that in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn
      disease, enteral nutrition promotes anabolism by suppressing proteolysis and
      increasing protein synthesis. Rates of suppression of proteolysis were similar to
      those reported previously in normal children.

TI  - The effect of marine oil-derived n-3 fatty acids on transepithelial calcium
      transport in Caco-2 cell models of healthy and inflamed intestines.
PG  - 281-8
AB  - Marine oil-derived n-3 fatty acids have been shown to stimulate intestinal Ca
      absorption in animal studies, but the effects of such fatty acids on Ca
      absorption in human subjects are relatively unknown. In particular, n-3 fatty
      acids may be of therapeutic value for some Crohn's disease patients who
      experience Ca malabsorption. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
      investigate the effect of 20 : 5n-3 and 22 : 6n-3 on transepithelial Ca transport
      across monolayers of healthy Caco-2 cells as well as of TNF-alpha-treated Caco-2 
      cells (an in vitro model of Crohn's disease). Caco-2 cells were seeded onto
      permeable filter supports and allowed to differentiate into monolayers, which
      were treated with 80 microM-20 : 5n-3, 80 microM-22 : 6n-3, or 40 microM-20 :
      5n-3 + 40 microM-22 : 6n-3 for 6 or 8 d, with or without co-treatment with
      TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) (n 11-15 monolayers per treatment). On day 16,
      transepithelial and transcellular transport of 45Ca and fluorescein transport (a 
      marker of paracellular diffusion) were measured. Treatment of healthy and
      inflamed Caco-2 cells with 20 : 5n-3, 22 : 6n-3 and both fatty acids combined for
      8 d significantly (P < 0.005-0.01) increased total transepithelial Ca transport
      compared with that in control, effects which were mediated by an enhanced rate of
      transcellular Ca transport. The effects of n-3 fatty acids on Ca absorption after
      6 d were less clear-cut. In conclusion, the present in vitro findings highlight
      the need to investigate the effect of marine oil-based n-3 fatty acids on Ca
      absorption in vivo in studies of healthy human subjects as well as of Crohn's
      disease patients.

TI  - Intercenter variation in initial management of children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 890-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation in care is a ubiquitous feature of medical practice and may
      lead to significant differences in health care costs, quality, and outcomes. We
      undertook this study to determine the extent of intercenter variation in the
      initial management of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease. METHODS: We 
      analyzed the utilization of 5 classes of medication (immunomodulators,
      prednisone, antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylates, and infliximab) among 311 children
      with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease followed at 10 North American pediatric
      gastroenterology centers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare
      the utilization rate of each class of medication at each of the 10 centers,
      adjusting for potential confounders including patient age, sex, race, disease
      severity, and anatomic location of disease. RESULTS: Median utilization of each
      class of medication was: immunomodulators, 56% (range 29%-97%); prednisone, 78%
      (range 32%-88%); antibiotics, 29% (range 11%-68%); 5-aminosalicylates, 63.5%
      (range 18%-92%); and infliximab, 7.5% (range 3%-21%). Each of these treatments
      showed statistically significant intercenter variation in utilization (P < 0.001 
      for immunomodulators, prednisone, antibiotics, and 5-ASA; P = 0.02 for
      infliximab). After adjusting for the demographic and clinical factors listed
      above, intercenter variation remained significant; however, the low utilization
      of infliximab precluded multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread
      intercenter variation in the medical management of newly diagnosed children with 
      Crohn's disease was observed, even after adjusting for possible differences in
      case mix between institutions. This variation may lead to unintended differences 
      in health care costs and outcomes.

TI  - Chios mastic treatment of patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 748-53
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of mastic administration on the clinical
      course and plasma inflammatory mediators of patients with active Crohn's disease 
      (CD). METHODS: This pilot study was conducted in patients with established mild
      to moderately active CD, attending the outpatient clinics of the hospital, and in
      healthy controls. Ten patients and 8 controls were recruited for a 4-wk treatment
      with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 g/cap). All patients successfully completed the 
      protocol. CD Activity Index (CDAI), Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), C-reactive
      protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
      monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and total antioxidant potential (TAP)
      were evaluated in the plasma at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. 
      Results were expressed as mean values +/- SE and P < 0.05 was considered to
      indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Patients exhibited significant
      reduction of CDAI (222.9 +/- 18.7 vs 136.3 +/- 12.3, P = 0.05) as compared to
      pretreament values. Plasma IL-6 was significantly decreased (21.2 +/- 9.3 pg/mL
      vs 7.2 +/- 2.8 pg/ mL, P = 0.027), and so did CRP (40.3 +/- 13.1 mg/mL vs 19.7
      +/- 5.5, P = 0.028). TAP was significantly increased (0.15 +/- 0.09 vs 0.57 +/-
      0.15 mmol/L uric acid, P = 0.036). No patient or control exhibited any kind of
      side effects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that mastic significantly decreased
      the activity index and the plasma levels of IL-6 and CRP in patients with mildly 
      to moderately active CD. Further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a
      larger number of patients are required to clarify the role of this natural
      product in the treatment of patients with CD.

TI  - Growth retardation in pediatric Crohn's disease: pathogenesis and interventions.
PG  - 620-8
AB  - Growth retardation (GR) may pose a significant challenge to the quality of life
      and the proper management of children and adolescents with Crohn's disease (CD). 
      It can occur in a significant proportion of patients, and may precede clinical
      evidence of bowel disease. Current evidence suggests that GR is a complex
      interaction between nutritional status, inflammation, disease severity, and
      genotype, which causes resistance to the effects of growth hormone. Recent
      research has identified a key role for the inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha,
      IL-6, and IL1 beta. This review summarizes current knowledge as well as gaps in
      our understanding of the mechanisms involved and the usefulness of the different 
      treatment modalities in promoting growth in CD patients.

TI  - Natalizumab therapy for moderate to severe Crohn disease in adolescents.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin-G4 antibody to [alpha]4
      integrin, in adolescent patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease
      (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a single-arm study, 38 adolescent patients (ages
      12-17 y) with active CD (Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >30)
      received 3 intravenous infusions of natalizumab (3 mg/kg) at 0, 4 and 8 weeks.
      The primary analysis was safety, assessed by adverse events, laboratory results, 
      and vital signs. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements and formation
      of anti-natalizumab antibodies also were analyzed. Efficacy outcomes were
      assessed by changes in PCDAI, quality of life (IMPACT III), and levels of
      C-reactive protein and serum albumin. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (82%) received
      3 natalizumab infusions. The most common adverse events were headache (26%),
      pyrexia (21%) and CD exacerbation (24%). Clinical response (> or =15-point
      decrease from baseline PCDAI) and remission (PCDAI < or =10) rates were greatest 
      at week 10 (55% and 29%, respectively). Three patients (8%) tested positive for
      anti-natalizumab antibodies. The peak level (61.0 and 66.3 microg/mL) and
      half-life (92.3 and 96.3 h) of natalizumab were comparable after the first and
      third infusions. Mean [alpha]4 integrin receptor saturation was 93% at 2 hours
      and <40% at 4 weeks after the first and third infusions. Increase from baseline
      in circulating lymphocytes ranged from 106% to 122% at 2 weeks and 45% to 65% at 
      4 weeks after each infusion. CONCLUSION: Natalizumab (3 mg/kg) was well tolerated
      in these adolescent patients with active CD, with a safety and efficacy profile
      similar to that of adult natalizumab-treated CD patients. Future studies should
      evaluate long-term safety and efficacy.

TI  - Polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not MDR1 influence response to
      medical therapy in pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 171-9
AB  - AIM: We investigated the contribution of variants of tumour necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha and MDR1 genes in the predisposition and response to medical therapy 
      in a large pediatric cohort of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 200 patients with CD, 186
      patients with UC, 434 parents (217 trios), and 347 healthy unrelated controls
      were investigated. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms -G308A and -C857T of the
      TNF-alpha gene and C3435T of the MDR1 gene were investigated and correlated with 
      clinical subphenotypes and efficacy of medical therapy. RESULTS: The frequency of
      the -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was significantly increased in both
      patients with CD (15%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.79; P < 0.01) and patients with UC
      (11%; OR = 1.96; P < 0.003) compared with controls (6%). Carriers of this allele 
      were 27% in CD (OR = 2.94; P < 0.01) and 19% in UC (OR = 1.86; P = 0.015)
      compared with 11% in healthy controls. No significant difference was found for
      both the -C857T and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With the
      genotype/phenotype analysis, no correlation in patients with UC with the MDR1
      gene was found. CD carriers of the -308A allele had a higher frequency of
      surgical resection (35% vs 20%; OR = 2.1; P = 0.035) and more frequent resistance
      to steroids (22% vs 8%; OR = 0.29; P = 0.032) compared with noncarriers. These
      findings were confirmed by stepwise logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: In our
      pediatric cohort, the promoter -308A polymorphism of TNF-alpha but not the MDR1
      gene is significantly involved in the predisposition to both CD and UC. This
      polymorphism carries a significant reduction in response to steroid therapy,
      probably leading to a more frequent need for surgical resection.

TI  - Enteral nutritional therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD000542
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the
      clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula
      design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This
      meta-analysis aims to provide an update on the existing effectiveness data for
      both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral
      nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) as 
      primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the
      importance of formula composition on effectiveness. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were
      selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases 
      MEDLINE (1966-2006) and EMBASE (1984-2006), as well as the Science Citation Index
      on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of
      references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts
      submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals:
      American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric
      Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, 
      and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials
      involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease
      activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration 
      of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of
      enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were
      selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted
      independently by two authors and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and
      discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual
      and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The
      results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square
      statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral
      nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of
      enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted
      on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity
      analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstract publications,
      methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part
      A, of the 15 included eligible trials (one abstract) comparing different
      formulations of EN for the treatment of active CD, 11 compared one (or more)
      elemental formula to a non-elemental one, three compared enteral diets of similar
      protein composition but different fat composition, and one compared non-elemental
      diets differing only in glutamine enrichment. Meta-analysis of ten trials
      comprising 334 patients demonstrated no difference in the efficacy of elemental
      versus non-elemental formulas (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.75). Subgroup analyses
      performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non-elemental diets
      (elemental, semi-elemental and polymeric) showed no statistically significant
      differences. Further analysis of seven trials including 209 patients treated with
      EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: < 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: 
      > 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in
      efficacy (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.01). Similarly, the effect of very low fat
      content (< 3 g/1000 kCal) or type of fat (long chain triglycerides) were
      investigated, but did not demonstrate a difference in efficacy in the treatment
      of active CD, although a non significant trend was demonstrated favoring very low
      fat and very low long chain triglyceride content. This result should be
      interpreted with caution due to statistically significant heterogeneity and small
      sample size. Sensitivity analyses had no significant effects on the results. The 
      role of specific fatty acids or disease characteristics on response to therapy
      could not be evaluated. In part B, eight trials (including two abstracts)
      comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for
      review. Meta-analysis of six trials that included 192 patients treated with
      enteral nutrition and 160 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.33
      favouring steroid therapy (95% CI 0.21 to 0.53). A sensitivity analysis including
      the abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 212 in the
      enteral nutrition group and 179 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis
      yielded a similar result (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56). There were inadequate
      data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease 
      duration and disease location. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is
      more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's
      disease as was found in previous systematic reviews. Protein composition does not
      influence the effectiveness of EN in the treatment of active CD. A non
      significant trend favouring very low fat and/or very low long chain triglyceride 
      content exists but larger trials are required to explore the significance of this
      finding.

TI  - Risk factors for intra-abdominal septic complications after a first ileocecal
      resection for Crohn's disease: a multivariate analysis in 161 consecutive
      patients.
PG  - 331-6
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess predictive factors of postoperative
      intra-abdominal septic complication in a homogenous group of patients undergoing 
      ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease. METHODS: From 1984 to 2004, 161
      consecutive patients with Crohn's disease (81 males; mean age, 33 +/- 10 years)
      underwent, as a first operation, an elective ileocecal resection without
      temporary stoma. Postoperatively, 15 patients (9 percent) developed abdominal
      septic complications, including abscess and anastomotic leaks. Possible factors
      for postoperative intra-abdominal septic complication were analyzed by both
      univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: There was no postoperative death. 
      Multivariate analysis found only four independent factors associated with a
      higher risk of postoperative intra-abdominal septic complication: poor
      nutritional status (odds ratio, 6.23 (1.75-22.52)), intra-abdominal abscess
      discovered during surgery (odds ratio, 7.47 (1.5-37.69)), preoperative steroids
      use more than three months (odds ratio, 5.95 (1.04-34.1)), and recurrent clinical
      episode of Crohn's disease (odds ratio (per episode), 1.38 (1.03-1.9)).
      CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent clinical episode of Crohn's disease, preoperative steroids
      use, poor nutritional status, and the presence of abscess at the time of surgery 
      significantly increased the risk of septic abdominal complications after first
      ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease. Knowledge of these risk factors could
      permit to propose a temporary stoma in very high-risk patients (i.e., with 3 or
      more risk factors).

TI  - Protein and energy metabolism response to the initial dose of infliximab in
      children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 737-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may contribute to the
      alterations in protein and energy metabolism present in children with Crohn's
      disease (CD), who frequently suffer from growth disturbance. We hypothesized that
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy would reduce protein losses, due to decreased proteolysis 
      and increased protein synthesis, and that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would decrease
      resting energy expenditure. METHODS: Children with active CD underwent metabolic 
      assessment immediately before and 2 weeks following initial infliximab infusion. 
      Using the stable isotopes [d5] phenylalanine and [1-13C] leucine, 2 independent
      measures of protein metabolism were determined during fasting and in response to 
      parenteral nutrition. Energy expenditure, determined by indirect calorimetry, was
      measured in fasting and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children
      completed the study. Following infliximab therapy, significant reductions in
      proteolysis (P < 0.05) were noted in the fasting state (8%-11%) and during
      parenteral nutrition infusion (10%-12%). Phenylalanine utilization for protein
      synthesis decreased significantly (8%-13%) following infliximab (P < 0.05).
      Protein balance was not significantly altered. No significant changes in energy
      expenditure were observed following infliximab in fasting or parenterally fed
      states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in significantly
      decreased proteolysis (8%-21%; P < 0.05), increased protein synthesis (37%-45%; P
      < 0.01), and improved protein balance (P < 0.01) compared to the fasting state.
      CONCLUSIONS: Following the initial infliximab infusion in children with CD,
      proteolysis and protein synthesis were significantly reduced in the fasting and
      parenterally fed states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in
      significant improvements in protein metabolism compared to the fasting state both
      before and after infliximab therapy.

TI  - Impact of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after
      resection for Crohn's disease: A prospective, non-randomized, parallel,
      controlled study.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of enteral nutrition on post-operative recurrence has not 
      been properly examined. AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition using
      an elemental diet on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for 
      ileal or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were studied. After operation, 20 patients
      continuously received enteral nutritional therapy (EN group), and 20 had neither 
      nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). In the EN group, enteral
      formula (Elental) was infused through a nasogastric tube in the night-time, and
      low fat foods were taken in the daytime. All patients were followed up regularly 
      for 1 year after operation. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at 6 and 12 months
      after operation. RESULTS: One patient (5%) in the EN group and seven (35%) in the
      non-EN group developed clinical recurrence during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.048).
      Six months after operation, five patients (25%) in the EN group and eight (40%)
      in the non-EN group developed endoscopic recurrence (P = 0.50). Twelve months
      after operation, endoscopic recurrence was observed in six patients (30%) in the 
      EN group and 14 (70%) in the non-EN group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term
      enteral nutritional therapy significantly reduced clinical and endoscopic
      recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease.

TI  - Lamina propria and circulating interleukin-8 in newly and previously diagnosed
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 365-72
AB  - Dysregulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production has been proposed to contribute 
      to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous
      studies, which evaluate adult patients with long-standing or steroid-modulated
      disease, have reported conflicting results regarding the role of IL-8 in IBD
      pathogenesis. The present study evaluates IL-8 in colonic organ cultures and sera
      of newly and previously diagnosed pediatric IBD patients with various degrees of 
      histopathologic activity. Colon and terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from 26
      patients with Crohn's disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis, 4 with indeterminate
      colitis, and 12 age-matched normal controls. IBD patients were additionally
      characterized as newly or previously diagnosed. Supernatants from organ-cultured 
      lamina propria biopsies and sera were evaluated by ELISA for IL-8 protein. IL-8
      increased with degree of histologic inflammation regardless of diagnosis (no
      pathologic diagnosis, 62.6 ng/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 30.4-94.6 ng/ml;
      mild, 92.0 ng/ml, IQR 21.9-170.0 ng/ml; moderate, 676.2 ng/ml, IQR 46.4-2967.7
      ng/ml; severe, 585.6 ng/ml, IQR 149.7-1602.2 ng/ml; P < 0.01). Lamina propria
      IL-8 was significantly elevated in moderately and severely inflamed tissue
      segments (603.26 ng/ml; IQR, 72.15-2240.4 ng/ml) compared to noninflamed and
      mildly inflamed segments (67.70 ng/ml; IQR, 30.38-124.1 ng/ml; P = 0.0009). There
      was no significant trend in IL-8 concentration when compared by clinical
      diagnosis. No significant difference was found in IL-8 concentrations in organ
      cultures from newly diagnosed patients versus those from previously diagnosed
      patients. There was no significant correlation between serum IL-8 concentration
      and organ culture IL-8 concentration. We conclude that higher concentrations of
      IL-8 are found in more histologically inflamed tissue segments from pediatric IBD
      patients. IL-8 does not appear to be associated with clinical IBD subtype. IL-8
      appears to be an integral part of both early and established mucosal inflammation
      in pediatric IBD patients. These findings suggest that IL-8-specific therapies
      may universally modify inflammatory activity in IBD patients.

TI  - Linear growth improves during infliximab therapy in children with chronically
      active severe Crohn's disease.
PG  - 424-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of infliximab as maintenance therapy in patients with
      otherwise chronically active Crohn's disease (CD) is well established. Data
      concerning the linear growth response are sparse and can only be accrued in
      children. METHODS: From September 2000 to February 2004, 32 children and
      adolescents (63% males; mean age 13.4 years, range 4.7-17.3) with chronically
      active CD despite immunomodulatory and prior corticosteroid therapy commenced
      infliximab therapy. Growth parameters standardized for age, gender, and pubertal 
      development prior to and following infliximab therapy were compared. RESULTS: In 
      all, 28 of 32 patients tolerated and responded to the induction regimen and 27
      responders continued to receive infliximab via regularly scheduled infusions (n =
      22) or episodically (n = 5) for a median of 26 months. Mean standard deviation
      score (SDS) for height at time of initiation of infliximab therapy was -1.15 +/- 
      1.2 and had declined despite the use of other therapies from -0.44 +/- 1.1 at
      initial diagnosis. Increases in height velocity and stature during infliximab
      therapy were limited by pubertal stage: Tanner I-III: DeltaSDS for height
      velocity +3.94, for height +0.50, P < 0.001; Tanner IV, V: DeltaSDS for height
      velocity +0.22, for height 0.02, P = NS. CONCLUSIONS: Height velocity improves
      and height centile increases during infliximab therapy provided patients are
      treated prior to or in early puberty. These data support the use of infliximab in
      young patients with otherwise refractory disease, and suggest that ultimate
      height in this subset of children with severe CD may be less compromised than
      with previous therapies.

TI  - Natural history of bone metabolism and bone mineral density in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: In children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is not known
      whether reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) are a consequence of bone
      turnover alterations and if BMD improves with treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of 
      children with IBD, we prospectively measured indicators of bone remodeling, body 
      mass index (BMI), disease activity, intact parathyroid hormone, serum IL-6, and
      insulin-like growth factor-I at diagnosis and then every 6 months for 2 years.
      BMD was determined annually using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD Z-scores
      were calculated using height/age. Baseline measurements and calcium intake were
      compared with a group of age- and sex-matched healthy children. RESULTS: We
      observed that at diagnosis total body BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) was -0.78 +/-
      1.02 for Crohn's disease (CD, n = 58), -0.46 +/- 1.14 for ulcerative colitis (UC,
      n = 18), and -0.17 +/- 0.95 for control (CL, n = 49) (P < 0.01, CD versus CL). In
      CD, a BMD Z-score <-1.0 was associated with lower BMI and higher serum IL-6.
      Patients with CD and UC had low bone turnover. Activation of bone formation
      paralleled clinical improvement, but BMC gain was less than expected over the
      2-year study period, especially in CD. Prednisone use did not correlate with low 
      BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone turnover occurs in children newly diagnosed with
      IBD. Although indicators of osteoblast activity increase with clinical
      improvement, bone mineral accrual does not accelerate. Children with low BMI may 
      be considered for BMD screening, since they are at risk for low bone mass.

TI  - Wireless video capsule in pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]) has a limited
      role, if any, in the evaluation of functional abdominal pain (FAP). Nevertheless,
      children with intractable FAP are occasionally referred to EGD to rule out
      intestinal pathology. We evaluated the role of wireless video capsule endoscopy
      (VCE) in children referred for EGD with a diagnosis of FAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Ten children older than 10 years of age were prospectively enrolled. Children
      were first studied with the PillCam SB (VCE; Given Imaging, Yokneam, Israel)
      followed by standard EGD within 2 weeks. After the completion of the study, a
      questionnaire of tolerance and content regarding the 2 procedures was completed
      by the patients. RESULTS: Physical examinations and laboratory tests were within 
      normal limits in all of the patients. Patients swallowed the endoscopic capsules 
      without difficulty. There were no complications. VCE identified gastritis in 4
      patients (confirmed by biopsies), whereas EGD detected erosive gastritis in only 
      1 of the 4 children. EGD detected no duodenal abnormalities. VCE detected Crohn
      disease in the small intestine and cecum in 1 patient. VCE was ranked by 8
      patients as convenient and as a preferable procedure compared with EGD.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this small cohort suggest that in children with FAP,
      VCE is more sensitive than EGD for detection of macroscopic gastric and small
      bowel pathologies.

LID - 0416 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic condition of the
      gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous
      inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form
      fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic
      predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following
      clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments in adults to
      induce remission in Crohn's disease? What are the effects of lifestyle
      interventions in adults with Crohn's disease to maintain remission? What are the 
      effects of surgical interventions in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease to
      induce remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with
      colonic Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of medical
      interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to
      maintain remission following surgery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane 
      Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews
      are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date
      version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations
      such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and

TI  - Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) treatment strategies in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 21-34
AB  - Crohn's disease is a complex multifactorial disorder characterized by the
      alternation of a cytokine-driven T-lymphocyte-depending inflammation of the
      intestinal mucosa, and "off" periods, where patients are completely asymptomatic.
      Although all the causative factors have not been clearly identified, the
      continuously growing understanding of the major abnormalities of the inflammatory
      and immune response leading to the often debilitating symptoms reported by
      Crohn's disease patients, improves our capacity to characterize new potential
      therapeutic targets with the subsequent hope to discover new (more efficient and 
      less toxic) drugs. Saying that, in the recent years, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
      undoubtedly emerges as a key cytokine involved in Crohn's disease pathogenesis,
      and constant efforts have been made to control tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      deleterious effects in Crohn's disease. This review schematically summarizes the 
      current understanding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha's role in Crohn's disease
      pathogenesis as well as the present and the future treatment strategies which may
      be helpful in patients by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha production and
      effects. Beside drugs under investigation, several original approaches are
      described or mentioned, most of them leading to recent patents such as polyclonal
      anti-TNF-alpha antibodies from avian origin, allowing potentially oral
      administration, or combination strategies such as vitamin D and anti-TNF-alpha
      antibodies or methotrexate and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, or decoy
      oligodeoxynucleotides interfering with the binding of nuclear factor-kappaB to
      its target genes promoters.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment on plasma antioxidant
      concentrations in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants may play a role
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being 
      used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children 
      with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15
      children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a
      paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a
      standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet
      (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of
      selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also
      malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive
      enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of
      the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14
      micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in
      mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7),
      P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}.
      The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change
      significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any
      significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
      changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with
      active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine
      supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.

TI  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody does not differentiate between Crohn's
      disease and intestinal tuberculosis.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - The clinical, morphological, and histological features of intestinal tuberculosis
      (IT) and Crohn's disease (CD) mimic so much, that it becomes difficult to
      differentiate between them. The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is
      almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it
      ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC;
      n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this
      study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified 
      Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum 
      was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated
      using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany).
      Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect
      immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and
      ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and
      patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was
      positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT,
      respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, 
      UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher
      number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy 
      controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with
      UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In
      comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more
      patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no
      significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs.
      46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was
      no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We
      conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and
      CD.

TI  - Pregnancy and delivery in patients with enterostomy due to anorectal
      complications from Crohn's disease.
PG  - 313-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Enterostomy is often undergone by patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD) due to severe anorectal lesions such as rectovaginal fistula (RVF). 
      Reports of successful pregnancy and delivery, which are important determinants of
      quality of life for female CD patients with stoma, are limited. Thus, we
      investigated problems associated with pregnancy and delivery in female CD
      patients at our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 2003, five
      female CD patients with enterostoma carried seven pregnancies and delivered eight
      babies in our hospital. For this study, we investigated CD activity, fetal
      growth, stoma complications, and the outcome of delivery in these seven
      pregnancies. RESULTS: Among the five patients, four underwent loop ileostomy and 
      one loop sigmoidostomy for treatment of RVF or severe stricture of the rectum or 
      sigmoid colon. Except for one case, no fertility treatment was done. During
      pregnancy, a flare-up was observed in one patient and was successfully treated
      with corticosteroids. Although home enteral or parenteral nutrition was required 
      in two cases, fetal growth was within the normal range in all pregnancies.
      Preterm delivery occurred in one case with a twin pregnancy. The mean diameter of
      stoma increased during pregnancy (p<0.01), and a mucosal laceration of stoma by
      the edge of an ostomy appliance occurred in one case. All deliveries were safe,
      with six cesarean sections and one transvaginal delivery. After each delivery,
      the stoma returned to pre-pregnancy size. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and delivery in 
      CD patients with stoma is safe and should be encouraged. However, special
      attention to disease activity, nutritional support, and stoma-related
      complications is recommended.
