TI  - [Zinc deficiency syndrome during TPN].
PG  - 209-12
AB  - The zinc deficiency syndrome, also called enteropathic acrodermatitis, has been
      mostly observed in those pathologies of the gastroenteric system characterized by
      grave food shortages during long term TPN in association with inflammatory
      intestinal pathologies. The authors believe this to be caused of such syndrome,
      that in the case in question is demonstrated before the normal period described
      in the literature to be caused by both increased request related to TPN and a
      greater loss or less absorption due to intestinal phlogosis. The case described
      has been noted in a general surgery division in a young patient suffering from
      Crohn's disease for many years in treatment with medical therapy and now
      complicated by perianal abscess following burrowing on the outside subjected and 
      therefore in treatment with artificial parenteral nutrition pre and post
      operative. Such pathology to be due when to begin a symptomatology characterized 
      by consciousness alteration, diarrhoea, vesicular squamous cutaneous lesions
      around orifices, often infected by bacteria and mycosis in patients in treatment 
      nutritional artificial continued for digestive apparatus diseases. The knowledge 
      of this syndrome and its diagnosis lead, through integrative therapy, to its
      resolution in a short time. The authors describe the course of a clinical case
      occurred to then and ended with the patient's recovery. They underline the risks 
      of ignoring this pathology.

TI  - Polymeric nutrition as the primary therapy in children with small bowel Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 609-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies in adults have shown that polymeric (whole protein)
      diets are as effective as semi-elemental and elemental formulae for the induction
      of remission in small bowel Crohn's disease. Whole protein diets are more
      palatable and cheaper. There have been no studies confirming efficacy in
      children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience with seven children with
      active small bowel Crohn's disease given a casein-based, polymeric feed rich in
      TGF-beta 2 (Specific Polymeric Diet; Nestle-Clintec; Vevey, Switzerland) as
      complete nutrition for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Initial and follow-up assessments were
      performed. All children showed a significant improvement in disease activity,
      with C-reactive protein returning to normal, an increase in serum albumin and a
      good weight gain. Initial and follow-up ileal biopsies were assessed and showed
      reduced mucosal inflammation in six of seven children, with complete healing in
      two. CONCLUSION: In an uncontrolled descriptive study we have shown that a
      polymeric (whole protein) diet is a therapeutic option for small bowel Crohn's
      disease in children. By comprehensive follow-up we have demonstrated clinical and
      biochemical remission, with an improved endoscopic appearance and a reduction of 
      mucosal inflammation in the terminal ileum.

TI  - Total parenteral nutrition modifies the acute phase response to Crohn's disease.
PG  - 360-4
AB  - Measurements of the acute phase proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      orosomucoid are widely used to monitor the activity of Crohn's disease. The
      effect of TPN upon the levels of acute phase proteins is unknown. Serum levels of
      CRP and orosomucoid were measured simultaneously over a four year period in 13
      patients receiving TPN for Crohn's disease, nine patients with noninflammatory
      causes of intestinal failure, and 16 patients with Crohn's disease treated
      without TPN. An acute phase response was found with a similar frequency in both
      groups of patients with Crohn's disease (73.6% and 83.9% for Crohn's with and
      without TPN respectively), but was less prevalent in patients receiving TPN for
      non-inflammatory causes of intestinal failure (56.1%, P < 0.01). In this latter
      group, the acute phase response consisted primarily of an isolated elevation of
      orosomucoid (78.4%), compared with patients with Crohn's disease alone (21.1%, P 
      < 0.001) and with Crohn's disease and TPN (46.6%, P < 0.05). Liver function
      abnormalities were seen on 68.8% of occasions in patients with noninflammatory
      causes of intestinal failure who had elevated levels of orosomucoid, compared
      with 34.9% of occasions on which orosomucoid levels were normal (P < 0.001). TPN 
      may lead to isolated elevation of serum levels of orosomucoid, reducing the value
      of this acute phase protein in monitoring the activity of Crohn's disease in
      patients receiving TPN.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 1281-302
AB  - IBD is one of the most significant chronic diseases afflicting children and
      adolescents. As in adults, UC and CD constitute the two major disease entities,
      with many of the characteristics of these two diseases being similar in adults
      and children. With technical advances, a complete endoscopic examination of the
      colon and terminal ileum can be performed in most children without difficulty.
      There are, however, a number of aspects of the presentation, course, and
      management of these diseases that are unique to the pediatric population. Because
      the impact of inadequate nutrition is much greater in the growing child than in
      adults, growth failure is a common, serious complication of malnutrition in this 
      population. The psychological impact of a chronic illness on both the developing 
      child and the family can also be significant. The management of this population
      is further complicated by the lack of adequate studies that assess not only the
      effect of a medical or surgical therapy on disease activity, but also address the
      issues of growth and pubertal development. It has been a challenge to extrapolate
      data from adult studies to the pediatric population. The management of children
      and adolescents requires a critical understanding of the differences between
      pediatric and adult patients to maximize growth potential and minimize longterm
      sequelae of treatment. After a long period of limited controlled studies,
      however, collaborative efforts are underway to investigate most aspects of
      pediatric IBD, and we look forward to exciting advances toward the optimal
      management of children and adolescents with IBD.

TI  - Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in children with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 707-11
AB  - Tests that positively identify individuals with ulcerative colitis,
      distinguishing them from patients with Crohn disease or other causes of colitis, 
      have not been reliable. Genetic predisposition to inflammatory bowel diseases and
      genetic influence on immune regulation resulted in the clinical evaluation of
      potential serologic markers. In adults the presence of anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in serum identifies patients with ulcerative colitis.
      In this study we demonstrated that high levels of ANCA are present in 83% of
      children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, the majority of
      patients with ulcerative colitis had a perinuclear pattern of these antibodies by
      indirect immunofluorescence. The combination of a positive ANCA and perinuclear
      indirect immunofluorescence pattern was 97% specific for ulcerative colitis. We
      conclude that determination of ANCA is a sensitive and specific clinical test for
      identification of children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Mechanisms of decreased food intake during weight loss in adult Crohn's disease
      patients without obvious malabsorption.
PG  - 775-81
AB  - Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated
      with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without
      malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients
      without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with
      weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group,
      food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed
      less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to
      eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was
      also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no
      difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure.
      Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather
      than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on
      the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.

TI  - Classification of the sequelae of bowel resection for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1627-31
AB  - A postoperative handicap index designed to predict diarrhoea and malnutrition
      following bowel resection in patients with Crohn's disease is proposed. The index
      takes into account the location and extent of resection, and its value can be
      calculated from operative records. Retrospective (n = 218) and prospective (n =
      68) series of patients were studied. Diarrhoea and malnutrition developed in 102 
      patients (47 per cent) and 13 patients (6 per cent) respectively in the
      retrospective series, and in 40 (59 per cent) and one (1 per cent) of those in
      the prospective series. The handicap index correlated with faecal weight and
      faecal fat in 112 patients tested. Positive and negative predictive values of an 
      index score greater than 20 for the development of diarrhoea, and over 50 for the
      development of malnutrition, were 0.64 and 0.90, and 0.60 and 0.99 respectively
      in the retrospective series; values were 0.80 and 0.71, and 0.25 and 1.00 in the 
      prospective series. The postoperative handicap index is a useful tool for
      predicting the functional consequences of bowel resection for Crohn's disease.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin release during long-term enteral
      nutrition in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 934-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallbladder bile stasis during long-term continuous enteral feeding
      may contribute to the high prevalence of gallstones in patients with Crohn's
      disease. We therefore examined the effects of continuous enteral nutrition on
      gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin (CCK) release in six patients. METHODS: 
      Gallbladder volume was measured ultrasonographically for 12 h on days 1 (start), 
      8, 22 (6-h interruption of enteral feeding), 36, and 43 (end) of enteral feeding.
      Plasma CCK was assessed at several time points. RESULTS: Initial fasting
      gallbladder volume was 19.3 +/- 4.5 (mean +/- SEM) ml, which decreased to 4.9 +/-
      3.6 ml after start of feeding. CCK increased from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.9 +/- 1.1
      pmol/l. On days 8 and 36 the gallbladder was almost completely contracted, and
      CCK increased to 7.5 +/- 2.7 and 8.3 +/- 2.6 pmol/l, respectively. On days 22 and
      43 gallbladder volume increased, and CCK decreased rapidly to fasting
      concentrations after interruption of feeding. CONCLUSIONS: During continuous
      enteral nutrition the gallbladder is completely contracted, and CCK
      concentrations remain elevated. It is therefore unlikely that long-term enteral
      nutrition contributes to the increased prevalence of gallstones in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Platelets in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease express functional
      interleukin-1 and interleukin-8 receptors.
PG  - 656-63
AB  - Tissue and plasma concentrations of several cytokines are increased in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Platelets play an important role in
      inflammation and circulate in an activated state in patients with IBD. This study
      assesses the expression of IL-8 and IL-1 receptors on the surface of platelets
      from patients with IBD using phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled recombinant human rhIL-1
      beta and rhIL-8 and flow cytometry. The percentage IL-1R expressing platelets
      (median and interquartile range IQR) in the IBD group was 8.7% (5.5-18.2)
      compared to 4.2% (2.3-6.1) in controls (P = 0.02). The percentage IL-8R
      expressing platelets in the IBD group was 22.5% (16.5-27.9) and 9.2% (4.3-9.6) in
      controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, platelet IL-1R expression in patients with IBD
      was inversely related to the total daily dose of steroids (r = 0.71, P < 0.01
      linear regression analysis). Finally, platelet rich plasma from healthy controls 
      was stimulated with rhIL-1 beta and rhIL-8 and assessed for activation dependent 
      expression of platelet aGPIIb/IIIa and CD62 (p-selectin, GMP-140). IL-1 beta and 
      IL-8 in vitro significantly and specifically activated the platelets. The surface
      membrane of platelets is able to express functional IL-1R and IL-8R, the
      expression of which is significantly increased in IBD. Interleukin-1 beta and
      IL-8 modulate platelet activation in vitro indicating a target role for platelet 
      function in inflammation.

TI  - Cyclosporin as initial treatment for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 243-7
AB  - Childhood Crohn's disease may cause significant morbidity. T cell activation is
      considered to be central to Crohn's disease pathology, and as cyclosporin is a
      powerful inhibitor of T cell activation, and has been used in adult Crohn's
      disease with encouraging results, it may offer the prospect of remission if given
      early in the course of disease. Children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease or 
      those relapsing off treatment were therefore given cyclosporin or conventional
      treatment (enteral nutrition or corticosteroids) by random allocation. Evaluation
      was performed initially and at two months. Twenty four children were studied (10 
      on cyclosporin and 14 on conventional treatment; one child on cyclosporin
      withdrew). Significant clinical improvement occurred in the group on conventional
      treatment, but not in the cyclosporin group. Colonoscopic improvement was noted
      in 5/9 on cyclosporin and 8/14 on conventional treatment, but neither group
      produced a significant fall in median colonoscopic index. Histological
      improvement was seen in 7/8 on cyclosporin and 8/13 on conventional treatment,
      but cyclosporin was not significantly better. Cyclosporin produced improved
      clinical and histological appearance without matched improvement in blood disease
      indices. It was not better than conventional treatment, and simple oral
      administration is probably not suitable for newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - [Randomized controlled trial of amino acid based diet versus oligopeptide based
      diet in enteral nutritional therapy of active Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1415-25
AB  - This study compared the short-term effect of semi-elemental diet in treatment of 
      active Crohn's disease with elemental diet which has been reported to be
      successful in inducing remission. The important differences between
      semi-elemental diet and elemental diet in composition are the form of nitrogen
      and fat content. Forty patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to
      receive for 6 weeks either elemental diet (n = 21) which is composed of amino
      acid based with low fat content or semi-elemental diet (n = 19) which is
      oligopeptide-based and has higher fat content. Both groups showed similar
      improvement in Dutch-AI, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, body mass index and
      radiographic findings of bowel lesion. The present study suggests that
      semi-elemental diet is equal to elemental diet for treating active Crohn's
      disease. We conclude the compositional differences between the two diets did not 
      affect the short-term effect of enteral nutritional therapy for active Crohn's
      disease.

PG  - 213-9
AB  - To examine the effect of paediatric GI disease on selenium concentration in
      plasma and glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma and red cells, results in
      children with Crohn's disease (n = 39), cystic fibrosis (n = 14), intractable
      diarrhoea (n = 13), and biliary atresia (n = 10) were compared with those from 86
      healthy children undergoing routine operations. In Crohn's disease, plasma
      selenium concentrations were rarely low, but glutathione peroxidase activity was 
      increased in the plasma and reduced in the red cells. Selenium concentration and 
      glutathione peroxidase activity increased with steroid treatment but decreased
      with a selenium-deficient elemental diet. Plasma selenium concentration was
      normal in children with cystic fibrosis but very low in severely malnourished
      children with biliary atresia and intractable diarrhoea. Selenium concentration
      and glutathione peroxidase activity should be monitored in children with severe
      malnutrition or requiring prolonged nutritional support. Supplementation is
      recommended in cases of severe selenium depletion.

TI  - Exclusive whole protein enteral diet versus prednisolone in the treatment of
      acute Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - Nineteen children with either newly diagnosed or relapsed Crohn's disease were
      enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of enteral feeding with a
      whole protein-based formula was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in
      achieving clinical remission and normalization of laboratory measurements. Ten
      children were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia), and nine 
      received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 11 weeks. The activity
      of Crohn's disease was similar in both groups before the commencement of the
      treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's
      disease activity index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity
      (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet
      count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status
      (concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved rapidly and
      significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment in both treatment groups. In
      both groups, there was one relapse within 8 weeks after discontinuation of
      treatment, and one patient in both groups was operated on during the treatment
      period. During the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3
      years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical relapse, whereas
      only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed. No side effects of enteral
      feeding were seen. Enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula proved to
      be as effective as high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase
      of Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in pediatric
      patients with acute Crohn's disease.

      relation to intestinal resection.
PG  - 351-4
AB  - The morphologic and cytoproliferative patterns of the duodenal mucosa of two
      adult patients, one of whom had a short bowel, were evaluated after more than 2
      months of postoperative total parenteral nutrition and 2 and 12 months after the 
      resumption of oral alimentation. Morphometric analysis was performed on routinely
      processed duodenal biopsies. Cell proliferation was evaluated by means of in
      vitro bromodeoxyuridine uptake. The results were compared with those obtained in 
      five healthy controls. After parenteral nutrition, patients showed significantly 
      lower villus height and crypt depth than those of controls and a normal
      bromodeoxyuridine labeling index. After 2 months of refeeding, villus and crypt
      returned to normal, and the labeling index was increased. After 12 months of oral
      refeeding, labeling index, villus height, and crypt depth were similar to those
      of controls. The patient with the short bowel showed a number of cells per unit
      length of villus and crypt significantly greater than those of the controls and
      of the patient who underwent shorter intestinal resection. In human duodenal
      mucosa, (1) hypoplasia develops after long-term total parenteral nutrition; (2)
      mucosal recovery occurs through an increased cell proliferation after oral
      refeeding; and (3) extensive small bowel resection determines the development of 
      relative hyperplasia.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha-producing cells in the intestinal mucosa of children 
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1455-66
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cytokines are thought to be important in mediating tissue damage
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many of the in vivo activities of tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) match the changes found in IBD, but its
      importance is controversial. METHODS: A sensitive, reverse hemolytic plaque assay
      was used to determine the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells isolated from
      mucosal biopsy specimens of children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
      (UC) and non-IBD controls before and after medical treatment. RESULTS: Frequency 
      of TNF-alpha secreting cells was significantly increased in biopsy specimens from
      children with mild, nonspecific inflammation compared with those with
      histologically normal intestine. Frequency did not increase in UC compared with
      children with nonspecific inflammation but was significantly greater in Crohn's
      disease than in UC. After treatment, the frequency of TNF-alpha secreting cells
      was reduced in patients receiving cyclosporin A, not reduced in patients with
      steroids or enteral nutrition, and not changed with treatment in UC. CONCLUSIONS:
      TNF-alpha secreting cells are increased in the mucosa of inflamed intestine,
      regardless of pathogenesis. In patients with IBD, higher levels are seen in
      Crohn's disease than in UC, probably reflecting the extensive T-cell activation
      in Crohn's disease. No relation existed between histological healing and the
      frequency of TNF-alpha-secreting cells.

TI  - Comparison of amino acid v peptide based enteral diets in active Crohn's disease:
      clinical and nutritional outcome.
PG  - 783-7
AB  - Elemental diets are considered an effective primary treatment for active Crohn's 
      disease. This study examined the hypothesis that improvement occurs because of
      the presence of amino acids or the low fat content, or both. A randomised,
      controlled trial was undertaken in 40 patients with active Crohn's disease to
      evaluate clinical and nutritional outcomes after an amino acid based diet
      containing 3% fat was given by a feeding tube compared with a peptide based diet 
      containing 33% fat. After three weeks' treatment, clinical remission occurred in 
      84% of patients who were given the amino acid diet and 75% of patients who
      received the peptide diet (p = 0.38). Plasma linoleic acid concentration was
      reduced after the amino acid but not the peptide diet. An increase in total body 
      nitrogen was associated with the magnitude of nutritional depletion before
      treatment and at six months' follow up, only patients who showed gains in total
      body nitrogen after enteral nutrition had a sustained clinical remission. This
      study shows that peptide based high fat diets are as effective as amino acid low 
      fat diets for achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. Improved
      total body protein stores but not essential fatty acid depletion may be an
      important indicator of a sustained remission.

TI  - Recurrent sepsis in home parenteral nutrition patients: an analysis of risk
      factors.
PG  - 256-63
AB  - Septicemia is the major cause of morbidity in home parenteral nutrition patients,
      accounting for approximately 70% of rehospitalizations. To identify risk factors,
      the incidence of infection was examined in 41 current home parenteral nutrition
      patients, 30 with short-bowel syndrome (including 16 with inflammatory bowel
      disease and 11 with bowel infarction) and 11 with chronic obstructive disorders. 
      Management, which was followed for a mean duration of 78.6 months (range, 1 to 15
      1/2 years), was standardized by protocol. Ten patients never experienced
      infection during the average follow-up of 61 months (range, 14 to 174 months),
      whereas seven patients experienced frequent infections during the mean follow-up 
      of 77 months (range, 24 to 180 months). Significant distinguishing features in
      the frequent-infection group were younger age (45 +/- 12 vs 66.9 +/- 14.3 years, 
      p < .05), Crohn's disease (in five of seven vs zero of 10 subjects, p < .05),
      jejunostomies (in seven of seven vs one of 10 subjects, p < .0005), and central
      vein thrombosis (in five of seven vs zero of 10 subjects, p < .05). A greater
      proportion of the frequent-infection group had poor catheter-care technique and
      more were smokers. One hundred fifty septicemias were confirmed by blood culture,
      giving an average infection rate of one every 31 months, 52% caused by
      Gram-positive organisms (chiefly coagulase-negative staphylococci and
      Staphylococcus aureus), 30% caused by Gram-negative organisms, and 16% caused by 
      fungus (chiefly Candida albicans).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Enteral supplementation of phosphate does not prevent hypophosphatemia during
      refeeding of cachectic patients.
PG  - 182-4
AB  - Hypophosphatemia due to parenteral nutrition has been described frequently. It
      was attributed to the lack of phosphorus content in parenteral nutrition
      solutions. With modern parenteral nutrition regimens containing phosphorus, this 
      problem has been virtually eliminated. Enteral nutrition solutions contain
      adequate phosphate for patients with normal phosphate stores. Hypophosphatemia
      has therefore rarely been reported in enteral nutrition. We describe two patients
      with protein-energy malnutrition who developed severe hypophosphatemia during
      tube feeding with phosphorus-containing formula diets. Chronic alcoholism and
      vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption because of Crohn's disease were
      additional risk factors in these two patients. Patients with depleted phosphate
      stores and high metabolic demand have a higher daily requirement for phosphorus
      than is available in routine isotonic enteral formulas. This case report
      emphasizes the importance of monitoring serum phosphate concentration daily
      during the first week of refeeding.

      consciousness disturbance. He also manifested erythrocytic macrocytosis, a low
      serum level of tri-iodothyronine and a high level of thyroxine. His blood levels 
      of various trace minerals and vitamins were normal, except for selenium, which
      showed extremely low values. In addition, impaired plasma glutathione peroxidase 
      activity was confirmed. After intravenous supplementation of selenium,
      macrocytosis, tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine values, and glutathione peroxidase 
      activity all became normalized, yet he improved little neurologically. Our case
      suggests that long-term selenium deficiency may cause progressive and
      irreversible encephalopathy, and that careful monitoring of this mineral is
      necessary when an excessive period of total parenteral nutrition is being
      considered in the clinical setting.

PG  - 250-6
AB  - We examined the rhythm of weight velocity in eight patients with Crohn's disease.
      In this paper we used the spline smoothing technique to study the cycle in the
      weight increment velocity curves derived from individual data during nutritional 
      therapy. As a result of the weight measurement at four-day intervals, an
      infradian rhythm with the average cycle of 9.6 +/- 0.7 was recognized in all of
      the subjects in terms of the weight increment velocity. This rhythm was
      especially conspicuous in three adolescent patients with serious nutritional
      lesion. The cycle of the rhythm was unaffected by any of the following factors:
      energy intake, contents of nutritional therapy, medical examination during the
      period. Our findings of a common cycle in the process of convalescence from a low
      nutritious stage in patients with Crohn's disease suggest that, in others as
      well, the weight increment velocity might have an infradian rhythm with a kind of
      inherent periodicity.

TI  - Childhood infections and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 555-60
AB  - Adults with inflammatory bowel disease from North Carolina were questioned during
      1986 and 1987 to assess risk due to a variety of childhood infections and
      treatments with antibiotics. Responses were compared with those of neighbor
      controls. Persons with Crohn's disease were more likely to report an increased
      frequency of childhood infections in general (odds ratio 4.67, 95% CI 2.65-8.23) 
      and pharyngitis specifically (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.51). This was
      validated by an increased frequency of tonsillectomy (odds ratio 1.53, 95% CI
      1.07-2.20). Crohn's cases were more likely to report frequent treatment with
      antibiotics for both otitis (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.03-4.14) and pharyngitis
      (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.20-3.84). Although Crohn's cases were more likely to
      report frequent exposure to penicillin (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.98-3.31), there
      did not appear to be excess risk conferred by penicillin after controlling for
      frequency of infections. Persons with ulcerative colitis also reported an excess 
      of infections generally (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.19-4.71), but not an excess of
      specific infections or treatments with antibiotics. Persons who reported an
      increased frequency of infections tended to have an earlier onset of Crohn's
      disease (P < 0.0001) and ulcerative colitis (P = 0.04). Finally, it was noted
      that urban living in childhood increased the risk for Crohn's disease. We
      conclude that childhood infections may be a risk factor for Crohn's disease and
      may presage the early onset of disease.

TI  - Surgical therapy of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 149-80
AB  - The overall impression gained from the experience of the Departments of
      Paediatric Gastroenterology and Surgery attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital are
      the enormous benefits that surgery has to confer on the large percentage of
      children with both Crohn's disease and idiopathic proctocolitis who require it.
      The surgical procedures described in this chapter have been accompanied by a
      remarkably low complication rate, dispelling the impression that morbidity in
      such cases would be high. This must in large measure be due to the fact that the 
      children who come to surgery are in as good a state of nutrition as can be
      achieved by means of the various forms of enteral and parenteral feeding now
      available. Anxiety about healing of anastomoses and the development of fistulas
      after surgery for example, has not been a feature of the surgical care of these
      patients. The principal benefit of surgery has been a clear demonstration of an
      improvement in growth velocity in both Crohn's disease and idiopathic
      proctocolitis patients provided always that surgery is correctly timed. It is the
      author's experience that maximum benefit is achieved if the bulk of the diseased 
      bowel can be removed. Plainly relief of symptoms such as abdominal pain and
      diarrhoea has also been rewarding. In many instances second procedures such as
      restorative proctectomy in idiopathic proctocolitis can be timed to fit in with
      educational commitments. In Crohn's disease the likelihood of recurrence in adult
      life is high but these patients are in a fit state to cope with further therapy
      including surgery should the need arise. From the management point of view the
      close cooperation between physicians and surgeons at all stages has been crucial,
      firstly to achieve smooth preparation prior to surgery and satisfactory after
      care. But of even more importance in the assessment of Crohn's disease is the
      presence of all clinicians involved in the case in the operating theatre so that 
      the surgical options are fully assessed. This united approach avoids any
      unnecessary anxiety when, as inevitably happens, recurrence of symptoms due to
      relapse occurs. The involvement of patients of whatever age, and parents in all
      the decision making processes from the time of diagnosis has been vital. Early
      discussion about stomas involving members of the Stomatherapy Department has been
      invaluable. One final important aspect of the management of these patients is the
      seamless hand-over of care to an adult combined medical and surgical clinic at an
      appropriate time, usually at the age of 17 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Medical management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 133-48
AB  - In the absence of a definitive cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,
      the aim of therapy must be to induce and maintain clinical remission at
      acceptable cost to the patient in terms of adverse effects. Despite the
      differences in their pathogenesis, the first-line treatments for Crohn's disease 
      and ulcerative colitis are still based upon combinations of amino-salicylic acid 
      derivatives and corticosteroids, although the use of enteral nutrition regimes is
      becoming increasingly widespread in Crohn's disease. In this chapter we attempt
      to provide reasonably didactic guidance for the management of most cases of
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, we have tried to go beyond this
      brief, motivated by the recent explosion in knowledge of inflammatory mechanisms,
      to suggest a rational approach to the choice of newer and less well tested
      therapeutic approaches in the affected child who is not responding effectively.
      The relative failure of cyclosporine therapy in Crohn's disease has been
      particularly disappointing in view of its ideal theoretical suitability. However,
      the encouraging early reports of treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-TNF alpha
      monoclonals suggest that the shift from broad spectrum immunomodulation to the
      targeting of critical components of the inflammatory cascade may yet field
      important dividends.

TI  - Critical assessment of body-composition measurements in malnourished subjects
      with Crohn's disease: the role of bioelectric impedance analysis.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) has been widely used for assessment of body 
      composition in healthy subjects but has not been validated in malnourished
      patients. This study compared calculation of fat-free mass (FFM) by five methods 
      to determine whether the currently used equations for total body water (TBW) as
      assessed by BIA were applicable to 19 malnourished patients with Crohn's disease.
      When compared with TBW assessed by H2(18)O dilution, BIA was higher by 5.9 +/-
      1.1% (P < 0.005). A stepwise-multiple-regression equation was derived to validate
      BIA: TBW (kg) = 0.25 (ht2/resistance) + 0.29 (wt) + 3.63 (r = 0.97, SEE = 0.28). 
      Comparison of the hydration of FFM (TBW by 18O dilution/FFM) between methods
      showed that total body potassium (TBK) gave a significantly higher value when
      compared with the reference method of body protein, mineral, and 18O analysis.
      Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provided a value for TBW/FFM in close
      agreement with the reference method. We conclude that BIA overestimates TBW, and 
      TBK underestimates FFM in malnourished patients. DXA provides an accurate
      measurement of body fat in malnutrition.

PG  - 84-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Inflammatory bowel disease can be associated with increased platelet 
      count. Aim of our study was focused on assessing thrombocyte count in evaluation 
      of the activity in Crohn's disease (CD). The study included a total of 19
      patients [6 men, 13 women (aged 18-57 years, mean 33, median 28]. All patients
      were malnourished in active stage of the disease on total parenteral and/or
      enteral nutrition (TP/EN). Thrombocytes were estimated at the beginning and after
      3 weeks of TP/EN in venous blood sample using automatic analyser Coulter Counter 
      JT3 (normal range: 130-380.10(9)/l). Serum prealbumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, 
      alpha 1-orosomucoid and C-reactive protein were measured simultaneously.
      Thrombocytes count below 400.10(9)/l was found only in 1/19 at the beginning and 
      in 7/19 patients in the end of the study. After 3 weeks of TP/EN a significant
      platelet count fall was found (mean +/- sd: 472 +/- 98 vs. 354 +/- 110, p <
      0.01). A correlation was found between thrombocytes and serum prealbumin (r =
      -0.3871, p < 0.05), haptoglobin (r = 0.5247, p < 0.001), alpha 1-orosomucoid (r =
      0.4857, p < 0.01) a C-reactive protein (r = 0.4354, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION:
      Thrombocyte count helped in the assessing of disease activity in CD on
      3-week-TP/EN. Improvement of clinical status, increase of nutritional parameters 
      and decrease of positive acute phase reactants were associated with a fall of
      platelet count in 15/19 patients.

TI  - Fecal short-chain fatty acids in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - Nutrition of colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes) is maintained by luminal
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), chiefly by n-butyrate. The importance of SCFAs
      for the maintenance of colonic epithelium has been demonstrated in animal models 
      of colitis produced by rectal instillation of an inhibitor of SCFA oxidation and 
      in patients with diversion colitis in whom a segment of colonic epithelium was
      deprived of contact with luminal SCFAs. We measured fecal SCFAs and lactate in
      children with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 17) and with Crohn's disease with
      ileocolonic involvement (CD; n = 22) and age-matched controls (n = 12) by a
      vacuum-distillation, gas chromatographic method. Fecal SCFA concentrations were
      correlated with scores of clinical disease activity. Patients with UC and CD had 
      a decrease in the fecal concentration of acetate (p < 0.05) and an increase in
      n-butyrate (p < 0.01) compared with controls. No significant changes in fecal
      lactate were seen. A comparison of inactive- or mild-UC patients with moderate or
      severe-UC patients yielded major differences in SCFA concentrations with
      n-butyrate increased in inactive and mild UC well above control values and total 
      SCFA and acetate decreased in moderate and severe UC below control levels. Raised
      concentrations of fecal n-butyrate may reflect impaired utilization of this SCFA 
      in the colon of patients with mild UC and Crohn's disease with colonic
      involvement. Whether this defect is primary or secondary to inhibitors in the
      colonic lumen, due to impaired transport of n-butyrate into the cell or defective
      metabolism within the cell, or specific to inflammatory bowel disease remains to 
      be explored.

TI  - Quality of life of patients receiving home parenteral or enteral nutrition
      support.
PG  - 101-8
AB  - Limited data are available on the impact of enterally or parenterally supplied
      home nutritional support on quality of life. Data from national registries have
      been useful in identifying the outcome of different patient groups in terms of
      their functional capacity and rehabilitation status. Results in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease are used as the 'gold standard' for this type of
      therapy. The annual cost of home parenteral nutrition can range from $US100 000
      to $US150 000 per patient, depending on the frequency of feeding. Only one
      cost-utility analysis has been reported in the literature, based on a Canadian
      home parenteral nutrition programme which suggested that the estimated
      quality-adjusted survival of patients receiving this treatment is 4 times greater
      than if they had not been treated. There are many controversial areas associated 
      with the use of home parenteral and enteral nutrition, including the treatment of
      patients with terminal malignant disease or severe dementia, and those infected
      with human immunodeficiency virus. To date, the clinical benefit of providing
      this type of nutritional support for these patient groups has not been clearly
      demonstrated. Prospective randomised controlled trials are necessary to evaluate 
      the costs and benefits of this expensive high technology treatment.

TI  - New alternatives for the treatment of fistulas in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 29-31
AB  - The authors refer on the combination of the administration of artificial
      nutrition with enterohormone Somatostatin in a group of 16 patients with Crohn's 
      disease (CD), complicated by the occurrence of fistulas. The sole administration 
      of total parenteral or enteral nutrition led in each case to a significant
      reduction of secretion from the fistulas, and in two cases to their complete
      closing. Apart from this, the nutritional status of the patients improved. The
      administration of Somatostatin i.v. in the form of the preparation Stilamin led
      to a further reduction of secretion from the fistulae. Complete closing of the
      fistulae due to a combination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or total
      enteral nutrition (TEN) and Stilamin, was achieved in only 2 patients, but the
      combination use of tissue sealant Histoacryle with the treatment resulted in a
      closure of the fistulas in a further 2 patients. Altogether the application of
      this treatment resulted in closing 6 fistulas (37.5%). The authors consider that 
      the above mentioned methods can open new prospectives, but this requires further 
      experience.

TI  - Strictureplasty for obstructive Crohn's disease: the Mayo experience.
PG  - 33-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strictureplasty for obstructive Crohn's disease of the small bowel
      continues to gain favor throughout the world. Although the potential advantages
      of preserving intestinal length are obvious, the optimal clinical setting for
      performing strictureplasty remains to be determined. PATIENTS: Of 244 patients
      who underwent abdominal exploration for complications of Crohn's disease between 
      Jan. 1, 1985, and Jan. 1, 1991, at the Mayo Clinic, 35 had a total of 71
      strictureplasties. Concomitant resection of bowel with active disease was
      performed in 67% of the procedures. RESULTS: In this series, no perioperative
      deaths occurred, and no anastomotic leaks, enteric fistulas, or intra-abdominal
      abscesses were noted during a 3-year follow-up. The overall perioperative
      complication rate was 14%. Postoperatively, 33 of the 35 patients were able to
      resume enteral nutrition and discontinue medical treatments. The symptomatic
      recurrence rate at 3 years was 20%; six patients have required reoperation.
      CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of strictureplasty for isolated,
      quiescent, stenotic bowel lesions associated with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition as primary therapy in Crohn's disease.
PG  - S55-9
AB  - The developments in enteral feeding for Crohn's disease in the past decade are
      critically reviewed. The advent of amino acid based chemically defined elemental 
      diets signalled the end of 'total bowel rest' in the management of these
      patients. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials showed that elemental diets
      were as effective as corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission in patients
      with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. The later use of peptide based
      elemental diets, in Crohn's disease produced somewhat conflicting results. The
      initial uncontrolled studies suggest that polymeric whole protein diets might
      also be effective in the management of acute exacerbations of the disease,
      casting in turn doubts concerning the role of dietary antigens in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Results of controlled studies comparing the use 
      of elemental and polymeric diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease have,
      however, also produced conflicting results. The results of one recent controlled 
      trial in which the use of polymeric diet was compared with that of
      corticosteroids does, however, suggest that these diets may have a primary
      therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease. An analysis of the composition of some of 
      the enteral diets used in different trials suggest that the effectiveness of
      enteral diets in treating active Crohn's disease might relate more to their fat
      than nitrogen composition. A hypothesis is proposed that the effectiveness of
      enteral nutrition in the primary therapy of acute exacerbations of Crohn's
      disease occurs because the successful diets used contain insufficient precursors 
      for arachidonate derived eicosanoid synthesis.

AB  - Corticosteroids are an efficient treatment for active Crohn's disease. The
      treatment has to be undertaken with a daily intake equivalent to 1 mg/kg per day 
      of prednisolone for a 3 to 7 week period. Immunosuppressive agents are indicated 
      in case of corticodependency or in case of large intestinal resection. Artificial
      nutrition (enteral or parenteral) is proposed in corticoresistant forms, and is
      usually followed by an immunosuppressive therapy. Surgical management is reserved
      for complications, including resistance to all medical therapy. Surgical
      resection has to be limited in order to avoid a short bowel syndrome. Surgery
      should not be considered as the ideal therapy as it has been demonstrated that
      recurrence after surgery increases at distance. 5-aminosalycilates compounds are 
      an alternative therapy in mild attacks. Mesalazine may reduce the recurrence and 
      could be considered as a possible maintenance treatment.

      the prevalence is 50.0-60.0:100,000. The prevalence in this countries 3.2:100,000
      and the characteristics of the disease are: a more benign course, better
      prognosis and infrequent involvement of the colon. The incidence of recurrence is
      40.0% during a 5 year period and 65% during a 10 year period. Practically, every 
      patient operated for Crohn's disease will be reoperated once during the first
      five postoperative years. The experience of the authors indicates that the
      situation in this country is considerably better. During the period ranging from 
      1980-1992, a total of 70 patients were operated for Crohn's disease. In this
      group of operated patients 24 (34.40%) had recurrent symptoms. Seven patients
      (10.0%) in the series, operated at an earlier date at this Institution, were
      reoperated for Crohn's disease. Another 8 patients (11.43%) were also reoperated 
      for Crohn's disease in this series, but their initial operation had been done at 
      a different Institution (palliative or inadequate prior surgery). Indications for
      reoperation did not differ from indications for the initial operation: existence 
      of surgical complications. The most important factors in the surgical management 
      of recurrence are: assessment of disease activity and progression and adequate
      preoperative and postoperative nutrition in order to improve the immune response,
      which is often impaired by previous surgery, disease activity and inadequate
      management. Correct operative strategy is crucial. The authors, in both initial
      and reoperations, perform limited resection of the small intestine, generous
      resection of the large intestine and stricturoplasty and divergent stomas on the 
      small intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The present study includes 40 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent an
      internal and psychodiagnostic examination over a period of 5 to 8 weeks. On the
      average, there were only minor psychic symptoms were recorded in the
      psychodiagnostic instruments. The fewest symptoms were seen in the
      recurrence-free interval, a moderate number at the beginning of intermittent
      inpatient treatment and the largest number of symptoms in patients transferred to
      a psychosomatic department. While decreasing significantly from high levels under
      internal intensive care and at the beginning of inpatient depth-analysis-based
      psychotherapy, symptoms of depression and anxiety dropped only slightly from
      initially low levels in outpatients. In addition, there were first changes in the
      patients personality profile during psychotherapy. The findings are discussed
      under diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.

TI  - Reduced metabolic efficiency in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2001-9
AB  - Malnutrition is frequently seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and 
      parenteral or enteral nutrition is considered essential in this patient group.
      However, many patients with Crohn's disease have difficulties in gaining weight
      in response to overfeeding, suggesting reduced energy retention. Substrate
      utilization and nutrient balances as well as changes in body composition were
      followed in 10 patients with Crohn's disease immediately in the course of
      remission on low-dose steroid treatment, during an eight-day period of continuous
      enteral nutrition at constant (protocol 1:1.5-fold basal energy expenditure) and 
      increasing (protocol 2:0.5- to 2.0-fold basal energy expenditure) nutrient
      supply. Energy, substrate, and nitrogen balances all became positive in response 
      to overfeeding. However, fat was predominantly oxidized at an infusion rate of
      1.2 g/kg body wt/day, whereas carbohydrates and proteins were effectively stored.
      A positive energy balance was reached at an energy infusion rate exceeding 31
      kcal/kg body wt/day and corresponding substrate supplies of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.1
      g/kg body wt/day for carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively. Nitrogen
      balance normalized at a supply of 0.14 g/kg body wt/day, which also reduced
      myofibrillar protein breakdown. Considering the relative contributions made by
      these nutrients in the diets, an accumulation of carbohydrates and protein but a 
      depletion in fat became evident from nutrient balances. In fact, body weight
      increased by 0.12 kg/day, which was explained by an increased extracellular
      (+0.18 kg/day) and body cell mass (+0.04 kg/day) at reduced fat mass (-0.10
      kg/day). Concomitantly, plasma T3 and insulin secretion both increased, whereas
      sympathetic nervous system activity decreased with overfeeding. This is contrary 
      to data observed in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Technetium-99m hexamethyl propylene amine oxime granulocyte scintigraphy in
      Crohn's disease: diagnostic and clinical relevance.
PG  - 1364-9
AB  - Scintigraphy with autologous granulocytes labelled by technetium-99m hexamethyl, 
      propylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) was performed in 103 Crohn's disease patients
      and 52 healthy controls. In 31 patients endoscopic and histologic activity was
      compared with scan activity index. In the 98 patients with a positive scan, the
      extent of Crohn's disease, assessed by scintigraphy, was compared with that
      evaluated by small bowel x ray or colonoscopy with biopsies. In 48 patients,
      Crohn's disease activity index, activity index, simple index, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein were correlated with the scan results. In 
      16 patients the five parameters and scan were repeated after treatment with
      methyl-prednisolone (10 cases), enteral nutrition (3), and 5-acetylsalicylic acid
      (3). The results showed that 99mTc-HMPAO granulocyte scan had a 95% sensitivity
      and 100% specificity to detect active inflammation; it correctly showed an
      abscess or a fistula in all the 24 cases found. The correlation between
      histological inflammatory activity and scan activity index was highly significant
      (r = 0.85; p < 0.01), less significant (r = 0.65; p < 0.01) between endoscopy and
      scan activity index. The evaluation for the extent of Crohn's disease by scan was
      completely correct in the small bowel (100%) and 93% correct in the large bowel. 
      No correlation was seen between the three clinical activity parameters and
      scanning; in more than 80% of the cases in remission on the basis of a clinical
      or laboratory index, scintigraphy remained positive. Medical treatment was
      effective on the clinical indices but not on the active inflammation in the
      ileum, whereas it led to a negative scan in 5/11 cases in the large intestine.
      Scintigraphy with 99mTc-HMPAO granulocyte plays an important part in Crohn's
      disease for the diagnosis of complications, for activity and assessment of the
      extent, and for the treatment results evaluation.

TI  - Multiple vitamin status in Crohn's disease. Correlation with disease activity.
PG  - 1614-8
AB  - We measured serum, blood, or red cell concentrations of various vitamins in 24
      patients with Crohn's disease who had been free from any nutritional treatment,
      and compared them with those in 24 healthy controls. Twelve of the patients were 
      affected in the small bowel only, two in the large bowel only, and the remaining 
      10 in both the small and large bowel. The fat-soluble vitamins A and E were
      significantly decreased in patients with Crohn's disease compared to controls.
      Among the water-soluble vitamins, vitamins B1, B2 and B6 and folic acid were more
      depleted in patients with Crohn's disease than in the controls, whereas vitamins 
      B12 and C, nicotinic acid, and biotin were not different between the two groups, 
      and pantothenic acid was increased in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition,
      vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid showed a negative correlation with the Crohn's
      disease activity index. These findings suggest that there is a variety of vitamin
      deficiencies in Crohn's disease prior to treatment and also that concentrations
      of some vitamins, such as vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid, may reflect the severity
      of the disease.

TI  - Plasma lipoprotein pattern during long-term home parenteral nutrition with two
      lipid emulsions.
PG  - 432-7
AB  - Hypertriglyceridemia induced by short-term lipid infusions causes redistribution 
      of neutral lipid components between endogenous lipoproteins and emulsion
      particles. To determine whether such redistribution occurs over a long-term
      infusion period and affects lipoprotein pattern, we studied seven patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease who received cyclic home parenteral nutrition for two 
      consecutive periods of 3 months with two different lipid emulsions. During each
      period, they received in random order either an emulsion composed exclusively of 
      soy-derived long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) or another emulsion containing an
      equal weight:weight mixture of long- and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs/LCTs). 
      Both emulsions contained 20 triglycerides (TGs) and 1.2 phospholipids. Lipids
      provided 50 of nonprotein energy. Blood samples were taken once a week, 1 hour
      before the end of infusion (during) and again after a 6- to 8-h lipid-free
      interval (baseline). During infusion, there was a moderate increase of plasma TGs
      and phospholipids and a slight decrease of plasma esterified cholesterol (CE) and
      free cholesterol. Most of the plasma TGs increase occurred in the
      very-low-density lipoprotein fraction (containing both emulsion particles and the
      endogenous very-low-density lipoprotein), but there was also an increase of TGs
      content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that 
      was more pronounced with MCTs/LCTs. Acquisition by exogenous particles of CE
      transferred from LDL and HDL was significant for the LCT emulsion only. Although 
      no change was observed in plasma lipid concentration of baseline samples during 3
      months of home parenteral nutrition, some modifications were observed in the
      composition of lipoprotein fractions demonstrating a redistribution of lipid
      components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Crohn's disease in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 1101-4
AB  - We report 17 children with Crohn's disease seen at King Abdulaziz University
      Jeddah, Saudi Arabia during 1980 to 1990. The ages ranged from 5 to 15 years; 10 
      cases were boys. The average duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 25
      months (range 4 days-4 years). The chief clinical features included abdominal
      pain in 15 patients, diarrhea in 12, fever in 7, hematochezia in 6, weight loss
      in 8 and arthralgia in 2 patients. Radiological signs of Crohn's disease
      involving the terminal ileum and/or the small bowel were seen in 4 of 10 cases.
      Four cases showed nonspecific inflammation with chronic inflammatory cells and
      granulomas on bowel and lymph node biopsies. A satisfactory response to therapy
      with steroids was seen in all cases. Sixteen recurrences were seen in 11
      patients; all these recurrences were mild and seen in patients with poor
      compliance to medication. This study suggests that Crohn's disease is not an
      uncommon entity in Saudi Arabia. Most cases show satisfactory response to therapy
      with steroids; however prolonged follow-up is required.

TI  - Breast-feeding and maternal smoking in the etiology of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis in childhood.
PG  - 387-92
AB  - Medical records concerning pediatric or adolescent patients first diagnosed with 
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in two New York hospitals during a 5-year
      period (1986 to 1990) were abstracted, and information concerning sex, age, race,
      birthplace, sibship size, birth order, maternal age at birth, month of birth,
      duration of breast-feeding, and maternal smoking was recorded. Medical records of
      patients presenting at the respective pediatric gastroenterology departments
      immediately before or after the patients with inflammatory bowel disease were
      seen were also abstracted in order to generate a control series. Data concerning 
      68 patients with Crohn's disease, 39 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 202
      control patients were analyzed through multiple logistic regression.
      Breast-feeding was negatively associated with Crohn's disease (P approximately
      0.04) and ulcerative colitis (P approximately 0.07), with relative risk point
      estimates around 0.5 and with evidence of duration-dependent trends in both
      instances. There was no evidence of association of either disease with maternal
      age at birth, birth order, maternal smoking, or season of birth.

TI  - Zinc supplementation restores plasma concentrations of zinc and thymulin in
      patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 275-80
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate whether oral supplementation with zinc
      sulphate (ZnSO4) could restore thymic endocrine function in patients with Crohn's
      disease who showed decreased plasma concentrations of zinc and active thymulin, a
      zinc-dependent thymic hormone. Twenty-seven patients in clinical remission were
      randomly assigned to receive, for 3 months, one of the following treatments: 60
      mg/day ZnSO4; 200 mg/day ZnSO4 or placebo. Plasma thymulin activity and zinc
      concentrations significantly increased only in patients treated with 200 mg/day
      ZnSO4. Lymphocyte subpopulations, within the range of normality before zinc
      supplementation, were unaffected by any of the administered treatments. In
      conclusion, low plasma concentrations of zinc and thymulin in Crohn's disease
      patients were restored by the administration of high doses of zinc.

TI  - Food intolerance and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 783-7
AB  - It has been claimed that prolonged remissions of Crohn's disease can be achieved 
      after enteral or parenteral nutrition, by identifying and excluding foods that
      exacerbate a patient's symptoms. The occurrence of food intolerances were
      assessed after induction of remission with elemental diet in 42 eligible patients
      to whom single foods were introduced over five days. Suspect foods were
      reinvestigated with open and if possible, double blind rechallenge. Fourteen
      patients (33%) dropped out of the study because of relapse of disease unrelated
      to food (n = 8) or because of difficulties in complying with the regimen (n = 6).
      Twenty (48%) of the patients identified food sensitivities whereas eight (19%)
      did not. Seventeen of the patients who identified food sensitivities had an open 
      rechallenge with recurrence of symptoms in 10 (24% of total). Food sensitivity
      was confirmed in three patients on double blind challenge. There was no
      significant difference in the duration of remission between patients who did or
      did not identify food sensitivities. During the study three cases of intolerance 
      to the formula diet, and one of severe salicylate sensitivity were encountered.
      In conclusion food sensitivities are evident after treatment of Crohn's disease
      with elemental diet but are variable, often do not persist, and are of
      insufficient importance to warrant putting all patients through elimination
      diets.

TI  - Polymeric enteral diets as primary treatment of active Crohn's disease: a
      prospective steroid controlled trial.
PG  - 778-82
AB  - Thirty two patients with active Crohn's disease were included in a controlled
      randomised trial to determine the efficacy and safety of polymeric enteral
      nutrition compared with steroids, to achieve and maintain clinical remission. The
      polymeric diet was administered through a fine bore nasogastric tube by
      continuous, pump assisted infusion (2800 (SEM 120) kcal/day). The steroid group
      received 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. Both treatments were effective in inducing
      clinical remission: 15 of the 17 patients given steroids and 12 of the 15
      patients assigned to the polymeric diet went into clinical remission (defined by 
      a Van Hees index < 120) within four weeks of treatment. The percentage reduction 
      of the Van Hees index was 34.8 (4.9)% for steroids and 32.3 (5)% for enteral
      nutrition (mean difference 2.5%; 95% CI--11.8% to +16.8%). Mean time elapsed to
      achieve remission was similar in both groups (2.0 (1) v 2.4 (1.2) weeks).
      Tolerance of the enteral diet was excellent. Four patients in the steroid group
      had mild complications attributable to this treatment. Ten patients (66.6%) in
      the steroid group and five (41.6%) in the enteral nutrition group relapsed within
      a year of discharge, but no differences were found in the cumulative probability 
      of relapse during the follow up period. These results suggest that polymeric
      enteral nutrition is as safe and effective as steroids in inducing short term
      remission in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Lamprene in ano-perineal lesions of Crohn's disease. A retrospective study].
PG  - 155-63
AB  - UNLABELLED: The efficacy of clofazimine (Lamprene) was analysed retrospectively
      in twenty one patients with anoperineal lesions (APL) of Crohn's disease.
      Clofazimine is known for its antimycobacterial, antiinflammatory and
      immunomodifier properties. It is used with success in leprosy and certain
      dermatological disorders. A number of clinical and laboratory arguments suggest
      the probability of a role of mycobacteria in the etiology of Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: twenty one patients with ileo-colono-anal or bucco-colono-anal Crohn's
      disease formed the basis of this study. They had been treated in various ways for
      APL, without success. They had APL of varying degrees of advancement (primary
      lesions: seven cases; secondary lesions: ten cases; major advanced lesions: four 
      cases). Treatment with Lamprene was given for three to 38 months (mean: 12
      months), the mean cumulative dose being 40 grams (4 to 146). Other therapeutic
      measures were started simultaneously in twelve patients: medical in six cases,
      medico-surgical in four cases and surgical only in two cases. The aim of
      treatment in fourteen cases was to obtain the healing of ulcerated lesions and/or
      fistulas, in three patients to delay dilatation sessions and in four patients to 
      avoid proctectomy in the short-term. RESULTS: ten patients showed no improvement 
      while eleven were improved (with regression of primary lesions in ten cases).
      Taking combined treatment into consideration, the link between the result
      obtained and Lamprene was considered probable in five cases, possible in four
      cases and uncertain in one case. Lamprene was well tolerated in general. It was
      not possible to evaluate the efficacy of treatment regarding intestinal disease. 
      CONCLUSION: the efficacy of Lamprene in ano-perineal lesions of Crohn's disease
      is possible and is worthy of evaluation in a controlled trial.

PG  - 420-3
AB  - Pancreatitis is generally regarded to be an extra-intestinal complication of
      Crohn's disease unless the duodenum is directly involved. Some reports in the
      recent literature, however, suggested a possible association of pancreatitis with
      Crohn's disease. In this report, we describe a 25-year-old male with Crohn's
      disease and pancreatitis, the etiology of which was uncertain. The pancreatitis
      resolved along with the clinical improvement in Crohn's disease. This case
      supports the concept of an association between Crohn's disease and pancreatitis.

TI  - Home elemental enteral hyperalimentation (HEEH) for the maintenance of remission 
      in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 379-84
AB  - Since specific treatment has not yet been decided on for Crohn's disease, the
      immediate target is the induction of remission and its maintenance. We examined
      the effects of an elemental diet (ED) in Crohn's disease with special reference
      to the maintenance of remission. Eighty-four patients received total enteral
      nutrition with the ED (35 to 40 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and/or
      conventional drug treatment for induction of remission. Sixty-one patients in
      remission were then followed-up with prolonged ED therapy (home elemental enteral
      hyperalimentation, HEEH) and/or drugs. During the follow-up periods the course of
      patients receiving HEEH was better than those of patients without HEEH, namely
      the cumulative continuous remission rates after one, 2 and 4 years were, 94%, 63%
      and 63% in the group receiving HEEH, 75%, 66% and 66% in the group receiving HEEH
      and drugs, 63%, 42% and 0% in the group receiving drugs, and 50%, 33% and 0% in
      the group receiving no maintenance therapy, respectively. In particular, when
      more than 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day of the ED was given, the maintenance
      of remission was successful in 95% of the patients. These results indicated that 
      ED therapy was effective not only for the induction of remission but also for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Rapid closure of Crohn's disease fistulas with continuous intravenous cyclosporin
      A.
PG  - 646-9
AB  - Fistulas complicating Crohn's disease often are refractory to medical management.
      Immunosuppressive therapy is sometimes effective but requires several months
      before efficacy can be determined. We treated five patients with Crohn's disease 
      complicated by chronic draining fistulas unresponsive to previous surgery,
      steroids, antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, 6-mercaptopurine, or
      azathioprine with continuous infusion cyclosporin A (CyA). The five patients had 
      a total of 12 fistulas (five enterovaginal, three perianal, three
      enterocutaneous, one enterovesical). CyA was administered initially at 4
      mg/kg/day for 6-10 days, after which oral dosing was begun at 8 mg/kg/day and
      adjusted to maintain trough serum levels of 100-200 ng/ml. All fistulas responded
      to CyA infusion with decreased drainage and with improvement in both perifistular
      inflammation and patient comfort. Complete resolution of drainage was seen in 10 
      of the 12 fistulas. Initial response was seen after a mean of 3.6 days (range,
      2-5 days) with complete cessation of drainage in the 10 fistulas after a mean of 
      7.9 days (range, 3-28 days). Therapy was continued for a mean of 6.2 months
      (range, 1.5-18 months). Relapse was seen in two perianal fistulas (3 wk and 7
      months) and in two enterovaginal fistulas (1 and 2 months). Two of these
      recurrences corresponded to lowered serum levels of CyA. An enterocutaneous
      fistula also recurred after 2.5 months, associated with a distal stricture that
      required resection. Side effects were minor except for a mycotic aneurysm in one 
      patient which occurred after 7 months of treatment. Intravenous CyA may prove to 
      be a useful agent in the initial management of refractory Crohn's disease
      fistulas, although relapse as serum levels are lowered and infectious
      complications are limiting factors for long-term use as a single agent.

TI  - Growth failure in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - To assess whether children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop
      permanent impairment of linear growth, we analyzed records from 48 young adults
      who had IBD during childhood or early adolescence (Tanner I-III; 11.8 +/- 2.4
      years old at diagnosis). All were fully grown (Tanner V; 21.1 +/- 3.0 years) at
      last examination. Adult heights were predicted from data obtained at or shortly
      after the diagnosis of IBD by three methods: height for age percentile, the
      Bailey-Pinneau (BP), and Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT) methods. Predicted adult
      heights were then compared with the actual ultimate height of each subject.
      Permanent growth failure occurred in 19-35% of subjects, depending upon the
      method used to assess growth. Overall, 31% (15 of 48) of the subjects had
      deficits of adult height identified by two or more methods, including 14 of 38
      (37%) of those with Crohn's disease but only one of 10 with ulcerative colitis.
      Age at diagnosis of IBD, age at last examination, age at cessation of linear
      growth, and site of IBD did not differ between impaired and normal growth groups.
      Duration of corticosteroid use was longer (p < 0.05) in growth-impaired subjects.
      In addition, although 60% of all subjects had periods of poor growth that put
      them in height-for-age percentiles two or more major growth channels below
      previous percentiles, only 19% remained at these levels upon achieving their
      final adult heights. Permanent impairment of linear growth leading to clinically 
      meaningful deficits of ultimate adult height is common in patients with IBD in
      childhood or early adolescence. New therapeutic approaches are needed to address 
      this problem.

TI  - [Reoperation in Crohn's disease].
PG  - 106-9
AB  - In 1967-1992 at the surgical clinic in Plzen 101 patients were operated with
      histologically confirmed Crohn's disease. A total of 32 urgent operations were
      performed. Due to the possibility to provide complete parenteral nutrition from
      this number during the past 6 years only three patients were operated. During the
      next and subsequent period 70 patients were reoperated. Relapses occurred most
      frequently four years after the first operation. As to the extent of resection,
      the authors agree with the view that 20 cm from the macroscopic borderline of the
      affection are sufficient without special regard to lymph nodes. Nevertheless it
      is important to keep in mind that Crohn's disease is a systemic disease and even 
      by radical removal of the affected part this disease cannot be cured by surgery.

TI  - Are single measurements of pseudocholinesterase and albumin markers for
      inflammatory activity or nutritional status in Crohn's disease?
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Serum pseudocholinesterase (PCHE) activity and serum albumin concentration have
      been used as markers for inflammatory activity as well as malnutrition in Crohn's
      disease (CD) with controversial results. Therefore we investigated the valence of
      both proteins as markers of inflammation and/or malnutrition in 50 patients with 
      active CD [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI): median = 243; interquartile
      range = 191-288] and 70 patients with quiescent CD (CDAI: 62; 25-96). Thirty
      patients were malnourished, 18 with active [body weight: 84%; 79-88% IBW (ideal
      body weight)] and 12 with quiescent CD (87.5%; 81.5-88% IBW), and 90 patients
      were well nourished, 32 with active (96%; 93-112% IBW) and 58 with quiescent CD
      (104.5%; 96-116% IBW). Median values of PCHE activity and albumin concentration
      were within the normal range in both groups, in patients with active as well as
      quiescent CD. PCHE activity was decreased only in 24 patients (48%) with active, 
      but also in 11 (15.7%) patients with quiescent disease. Albumin concentration was
      decreased in 12 patients (24%) with active and in one patient (1.4%) with
      quiescent disease. Comparing the two patient groups PCHE activity and albumin
      concentration were significantly lower in active than in quiescent CD [PCHE: 3.70
      kU/l; 3.00-4.30 kU/l vs. 4.80 kU/l; 3.75-5.82 kU/l, p < 0.001; Albumin: 38.0 g/l;
      35.1-39.9 g/l vs. 43.8 g/l; 40.8-46.3 g/l, p < 0.001]. Both proteins were
      significantly lower in malnourished than in well nourished patients, except
      albumin in patients with quiescent CD. Repeated measurements of PCHE and albumin 
      in patients during and after active phases showed significant increases of both
      proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The short bowel syndrome: what's new and old?
PG  - 12-31
AB  - Conditions which resulted in colonic preservation such as strangulated hernia,
      intestinal volvulus, and mesenteric infarction were once the main reasons for a
      major intestinal resection leading to the short bowel syndrome. Now Crohn's
      disease is the most common underlying diagnosis; such patients often have a
      jejunostomy. A measurement of the residual jejunal length from the duodenojejunal
      flexure makes possible predictions of patient outcome. Patients with a
      jejunostomy and less than 100 cm jejunum usually need long-term parenteral
      support, whereas 50 cm or more of jejunum usually suffices for adequate oral
      nutrition if the colon is preserved. While patients with and without a colon have
      problems with nutrient absorption, those with a jejunostomy also have problems of
      water, sodium and magnesium losses. Stomal losses may exceed oral intake and all 
      such patients ('secretors') need parenteral supplements. Fluid and sodium losses 
      can be reduced by octreotide, omeprazole or H2 blockers but not sufficiently to
      avoid the need for intravenous supplements. Colonic preservation increases the
      incidence of calcium oxalate renal stones (20%). Patients with and without a
      colon have a high prevalence of gallstones (40%). Clinically important intestinal
      adaptation occurs in those with a colon but not in those with a jejunostomy. Many
      surgical techniques, including small bowel transplantation, have been suggested
      to improve absorption, but as the quality of life of most patients with a short
      bowel is good with current treatments, they are not at present recommended.

PG  - 1-10
AB  - One hundred and two patients with Crohn's colitis present on average for 8 years,
      were studied retrospectively in order to determine whether or not a group of
      patients existed in whom the disease remained limited to the colon, and if such a
      group could be identified early on in the course of the disorder. At the time of 
      the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, 34 patients had a concomitant anoperineal
      lesion, while 68 had disease affecting the colon only. In the latter, at the end 
      of the follow-up period, the disease remained exclusively limited to the colon in
      39 cases (57 p. cent). The actuarial rate of non-extra-colonic spread was 75, 40 
      and 35 p. cent at 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. Spread involved above all the 
      anoperineal region (55 p. cent at 10 years), and less often the ileum (20 p. cent
      at 10 years). In patients monitored for at least 6 years, there was no
      significant difference between those in whom disease had spread and those in whom
      it remained limited to the colon, regarding the main initial clinical findings by
      history and examination, the same applying after the disease had been present for
      3 years. These results would go against the existence of a specific entity of
      "Crohn's disease affecting the colon as an organ" and support the opinion that
      coloproctectomy with a pouch should be avoided in colitis due to Crohn's disease.

TI  - Total energy expenditure in patients with Crohn's disease: measurement by the
      combined body scan technique.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - A combined body scan technique for measuring total energy expenditure (TEE) from 
      energy intake and changes in energy stores is presented. The TEE of 13 patients
      with Crohn's disease who required nutrition support over a 14-day period was
      measured. They had a mean TEE of 33 kcal/kg per day. The components of the TEE in
      these 13 patients were also measured. Seventy percent of the TEE was made up by
      resting metabolic expenditure, 10% by diet-induced thermogenesis, and the
      remaining 20% by activity energy expenditure. These patients had a mean activity 
      energy expenditure of 369 kcal/day. The diet-induced thermogenesis was a mean
      12.6% increase on the resting metabolic expenditure. Each percent increase was
      caused by a mean of 210 kcal of energy in either the intravenous nutrition or the
      enteral nutrition. There was no difference in diet-induced thermogenesis between 
      those having enteral nutrition and those receiving intravenous nutrition.
      Decreased activity was significantly correlated with increased activity of the
      disease (r = .7, p < .01). This confirms the belief that patients with Crohn's
      disease require no more energy (ie, 33 kcal/kg per day) than other patients. If
      the resting metabolic expenditure is increased through illness, then the activity
      energy expenditure decreases. The combined in vivo neutron activation-dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry technique has allowed for the first time measurements in
      ward patients with Crohn's disease. The measurements confirm that TEE is not
      raised and that 30 to 35 kcal/kg per day is sufficient to achieve energy balance 
      in such patients.

TI  - Immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: results of a
      survey of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and
      Nutrition. Subcommittee on Immunosuppressive Use of the Pediatric IBD
      Collaborative Research Forum.
PG  - 44-8
AB  - We report the results of a survey of the membership of the North American Society
      for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition designed to determine pediatric
      gastroenterologists' attitudes toward the use of immunosuppressive therapy for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to assess how these medications are
      actually being used in the treatment of children with IBD. One hundred five
      physicians (27% of surveys) responded. Eighty-eight (84%) had prescribed
      6-mercaptopurine and/or azathioprine for IBD, and 66 believed that they were
      effective. Only 12 had used cyclosporine and four methotrexate. All physicians
      who had used immunosuppressives in IBD had prescribed them for patients with
      Crohn's disease, but only 50% had prescribed them for ulcerative colitis. The
      predominant indications for use included intractable symptoms despite traditional
      medical therapy (92%) and for corticosteroid-sparing effects (86%). Potential
      toxicities of greatest concern included marrow and immune suppression and
      malignancy. The vast majority of responders were not certain what to recommend
      with respect to the use of immunosuppressive agents prior to and during
      pregnancy. A clinical database was compiled from 165 retrospective case reports
      submitted by 45 physicians (33 medical facilities). At the start of
      immunosuppressive therapy, patients were 15.3 +/- 4.0 yr of age, and 52% were
      Tanner IV-V. Eighty-one percent had Crohn's disease, 8% ulcerative colitis, and
      11% indeterminant colitis. One hundred twenty-two were treated with
      6-mercaptopurine, and 43 with azathioprine. Five also received cyclosporine
      concomitantly. Overall, 68% of patients treated with an immunosuppressive
      improved. Complications requiring discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy
      occurred in 6% of patients. It appears that immunosuppressives are commonly used 
      to treat children with IBD despite a paucity of data regarding their safety and
      efficacy in this age group. Controlled, prospective trials are warranted to
      better define the role of immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric IBD.

TI  - [Decrease of fecal beta-galactosidase activity in Crohn disease].
PG  - 718-22
AB  - An increased degradation of colonic mucus by bacterial enzymes might participate 
      in the development of mucosal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease. The
      biodisponibility of drugs used in the treatment of such disease relies upon the
      metabolic activity of colonic bacterial flora. This activity can be indirectly
      assessed by measuring fecal enzymatic activities. The aim of this study was to
      compare fecal beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity in controls, in patients
      suffering from extradigestive inflammatory disease and in patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD). Three groups were studied including 11 healthy volunteers (6 F, 5
      M) mean age 29 years (21-37), 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (17 F, 3
      M), mean age 61.5 years, and 34 patients with non operated CD (21 F, 13 M) mean
      age: 27 years (13-50). The Crohn disease activity index (CDAI) was > 150 in 24
      and < 150 in 10. beta-gal activity was measured in fecal extracts by its ability 
      to hydrolyze paranitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside and expressed as units of
      enzymatic activity/gram of fecal proteins. beta-gal activity was significantly
      decreased in patients with CD (16 +/- 4.5 U/g) (m +/- sem) as compared with
      patients with RA (353 +/- 64 U/g) (P < 0.0001) and to controls (263 +/- 40 U/g)
      (P = 0.002). beta-gal activity was not significantly different in controls and in
      patients with RA. Patients with active CD had a significantly lower beta-gal
      activity than patients with quiescent CD (9.5 +/- 3.7 U/g vs 31.4 +/- 11.5 U/g)
      (P = 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Trefoil peptide gene expression in small intestinal Crohn's disease and dietary
      adaptation.
PG  - S78-91
AB  - We examined the patterns of trefoil peptide gene expression in the
      ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL) and mucosa adjacent to Crohn's disease in
      humans and during gastrointestinal adaptation to enteral feeding in rats. In the 
      UACL, human spasmolytic polypeptide (hSP) mRNA and peptide are present in the
      acinar and proximal duct cells, whereas pS2 mRNA and peptide are found in the
      distal duct cells and in the surface cells. In mucosa adjacent to UACL, pS2 mRNA 
      and peptide are expressed ectopically by goblet cells and neuroendocrine cells.
      Intestinal crypts associated with the UACL showed marked neuroendocrine cell
      hyperplasia. Ultrastructural immunolocalization showed pS2 to be copackaged in
      the mucous cell and neuroendocrine granules. The copackaging of a secretory
      protein in both mucous and neuroendocrine granules, which have different
      functions, is unusual and indicates an important role for pS2 in the secretory
      process itself or as a ligand delivered to its receptor via multiple routes. We
      also cloned the newest trefoil peptide, intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), from
      human and rat intestinal mucosa. Using in situ hybridization we demonstrated its 
      synthesis by normal rat intestinal goblet cells. RNAse protection analysis
      revealed that the level of mRNA for rat ITF in small and large intestine was
      affected by the process of enteral feeding. We conclude that trefoil peptides are
      widely distributed in the intestine in human inflammatory bowel disease and are
      of considerable potential functional importance.

TI  - Immunoglobulin G subclasses in Crohn's disease with and without bowel resection.
PG  - 139-47
AB  - Increased immunoglobulin G2 [IgG2] in Crohn's disease in contrast with increased 
      IgG1 in ulcerative colitis was reported in literature data. The aim of our study 
      has been focused on serum IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with resected bowel
      (11 patients) and without previous surgery for Crohn's disease (12 patients). All
      patients were in active stage of the disease on total parenteral nutrition. Serum
      IgG subclasses were estimated by means of radial immunodiffusion. There was no
      significant differences between in IgG subclasses in Crohn's disease with and
      without bowel resection. IgG2 over 4.5 g/l was found only in 2/12 with resected
      bowel and 1/11 without previous surgery for Crohn's disease. Surprisingly,
      IgG1/IgG2 ratio below 1.5 was found only in 5/23 persons. In 3/23 patients IgG1
      was over 10.5 g/l although there was no doubt about the diagnosis of Crohn's
      disease. IgG subclasses failed to help in confirmation of the diagnosis of
      Crohn's disease. Serum IgG subclasses alterations probably are not influenced by 
      bowel resection and/or nutritional status.

AB  - Crohn's disease is an inflammatory process commonly characterized by phases of
      flare-up. Weight loss and malnutrition are prominent features in the course of
      the disease, especially during acute episodes. It is therefore important to
      define energy needs. Curiously, resting energy expenditure (REE) has rarely been 
      studied in Crohn's disease, and never in relation with the activity of the
      disease. We therefore determined REE together with body composition (fat free
      mass, FFM), Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and plasma acute phase proteins
      in 70 patients: during flare-up in 41 and during clinical remission (CDAI < 150) 
      in 29. We found an increase in REE in patients with active disease (CDAI > 150), 
      as compared with patients in remission, when REE was expressed as a function of
      FFM: 31.7 +/- 2.7 versus 29.4 +/- 3.3 kcal/kg FFM/day (P < 0.01). The mean
      REE/FFM was 8% higher during flare-up than during remission, and was correlated
      to both clinical (CDAI; P = 0.011) and biological inflammatory activity indices
      (C reactive protein, P = 0.018; orosomucoid, P = 0.024). In some patients, the
      REE was in the normal range, despite an increase in REE/FFM, because of a
      decrease in FFM due to hypermetabolism. In 8 patients treated successfully by
      total parenteral nutrition for a massive flare-up, REE/FFM was increased before
      TPN (36.6 +/- 3.0 kcal/kg/day), and decreased after 4 weeks of TPN (31.4 +/- 1.8 
      kcal/kg/day; P < 0.001), returning within normal values in 7 patients.

PG  - 70-83
AB  - The aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease remains unknown. While
      this remains so, treatment must be directed towards pathogenetic mechanisms.
      Corticosteroids, sulphasalazine and the new salicylates, the immunosuppressants
      azathioprine, 6-MP and, more recently, cyclosporin and metronidazole have become 
      the accepted and standard forms of treatment. The importance of maintaining
      nutritional status is often overlooked but must be considered in every patient.
      Recognition of the occurrence of disease in all age groups, and in particular in 
      children and adolescents, is also important, as is an appreciation of the special
      problems involved. The possibility of surgery at some stage of the disease should
      be raised with the patient. As the pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel 
      disease are further elucidated, new forms of treatment will be developed. This is
      already happening, with studies looking at such agents as immunoglobulin G,
      eicosapentaenoic acid and a new specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. These offer
      hope of more potent drugs with low side-effect profiles that may complement or
      replace the currently available agents used in the management of inflammatory
      bowel disease.
