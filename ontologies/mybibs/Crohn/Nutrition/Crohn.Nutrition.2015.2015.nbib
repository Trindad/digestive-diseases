TI  - [Hormonal changes in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 5S35-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is often accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations
      due to a common autoimmune etiopathogenesis, chronic systemic inflammation,
      frequent nutrition deficits, and the treatment. Endocrine system changes belong
      to manifestations too. Interaction is mutual, Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis cause functional and morphological changes of endocrine tissues. On the
      other hand the endocrine disorders negatively influence the course of bowel
      disease. In the article we analyze correlation of IBD with gonadal hormone
      production and fertility, with adrenal function, with the function and morphology
      of the thyroid, with growth hormone production and growth disorders in children, 
      and with bone mineral density reduction. This topic is not studied enough and
      needs more analysis and clarification.

TI  - Up regulation of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is
      associated with intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis in TNBS-induced
      experimental colitis.
PG  - 365-71
LID - 10.1016/j.prp.2015.09.019 [doi]
LID - S0344-0338(15)30018-2 [pii]
AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

TI  - Vitamin D status in relation to Crohn's disease: Meta-analysis of observational
      studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inconsistent findings have been published regarding vitamin D status 
      among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and the association with disease
      severity. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis evaluating serum 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D and 1,25 dehydroxyvitamin D among CD patients compared with healthy and
      non-healthy controls, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and the association
      with disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar up
      to March 2015 for observational studies assessing serum vitamin D levels in CD
      patients. A total of 63 studies were included in the following four
      meta-analyses: 1) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 25(OH)D levels in CD 
      patients compared with healthy (number of studies = 27) and non-healthy (n = 25) 
      controls; 2) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 1,25(OH)2 D3 levels in CD 
      patients compared with healthy (n = 7) and non-healthy (n = 8) controls; 3) a
      meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (n = 34); 4) a
      meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients between vitamin D status severity
      of CD (n = 6). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to discover
      possible sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: It was found that CD
      patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D compared with healthy (-3.99 ng/mL; 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: -5.91 to -2.08) but not non-healthy controls (-1.07
      ng/mL; 95% CI: -2.84 to 0.70). There was also no significant mean difference for 
      1,25(OH)2 D3 for both healthy and non-healthy controls. Meta-analysis on the
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency showed an overall prevalence of 57.7% (95% CI:
      0.502-0.649). An inverse association was observed between serum vitamin D and
      severity of CD (-0.36; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.24). Meta-regression showed that mean 
      levels of 25(OH)D were decreased 0.09 for each unit change of latitude among CD
      patients compared with healthy controls (B = -0.09, P = 0.004, I(2) residual =
      86.08%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with Crohn's disease had lower serum
      25(OH)D concentrations compared with their healthy counterparts, and more than
      half of them have hypovitaminosis D. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation
      between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and severity of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Fecal Calprotectin as an Activity Marker of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in
      Children.
PG  - 815-22
LID - 10.17219/acem/26003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children constitute 20% of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases 
      (IBD). Still there is a search for a perfect marker for this group of patients
      which would help in the diagnosis of the disease, in determinating its activity
      and in monitoring the treatment. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the usefulness of the
      application of calprotectin measurement in stool samples from children with IBD, 
      as a marker of the severity of inflammation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed
      156 patients: 58 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 67 with Crohn's disease (CD), and 
      31 from the control group. In all patients the concentration of calprotectin in
      the sample of feces, markers of inflammation and hemoglobin were measured.
      RESULTS: Concentration of calprotectin in feces of patients with IBD was above
      the normal range in all patients with moderate and severe disease and in the
      majority with mild disease or in remission, but it was normal in all patients
      from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated concentration of fecal calprotectin
      (FC) was observed in the majority of patients with IBD, but in none from the
      control group. The number of patients with elevated FC concentration increased
      together with the disease activity. FC concentration was higher in patients with 
      severe and moderate disease activity. FC concentration in patients with IBD was
      associated with the increase of inflammatory markers and decreased haemoglobin.
      Percentage of laboratory abnormalities in children with Crohn's disease and
      perianal changes was higher. FC concentration can be a noninvasive marker of
      disease activity in IBD.

TI  - Outcome of Surgery for Coloduodenal Fistula in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 976-84
LID - 10.1007/s11605-015-3065-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to report the short- and long-term outcomes 
      of surgery for coloduodenal fistula in Crohn's disease and explore the effect of 
      preoperative optimization on surgical outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective
      review of 34 patients with coloduodenal fistula complicating Crohn's disease
      between Jan 2008 and May 2015. Demographic information, preoperative management, 
      and intraoperative and postoperative outcome data were collected. RESULTS:
      Primary duodenal repair was carried out in 33 patients (13 with duodenal defect
      >3 cm), and bypass surgery was performed in one patient with duodenal stenosis.
      Patients undergoing preoperative optimization (n = 25) had decreased
      postoperative major (24.0 vs. 87.5 %, P = 0.005) and intra-abdominal septic (20.0
      vs. 75.0 %, P = 0.008) complications compared to patients with
      emergent/semi-emergent surgery (n = 8). No duodenal stenosis occurred on a median
      follow-up of 22.5 months. Patients with duodenum-ileocolic anastomosis fistula
      had longer postoperative stay (14.0 vs. 10.0 days, P = 0.032) and increased
      possibility of refistulization of the duodenum on follow-up (30.0 vs. 0 %, P =
      0.031) compared with those with spontaneous duodenum-colonic fistula. CONCLUSION:
      Primary duodenal repair can be safely performed in coloduodenal fistula in
      Crohn's disease provided there was no duodenal stenosis, even for large duodenal 
      defects. Preoperative optimization is associated with reduced postoperative
      complications. Patients with duodenum-ileocolic anastomosis fistula are more
      likely to have duodenum fistula recurrence compared to those with spontaneous
      duodenum-colonic fistula.

TI  - Incidence Trends and Geographical Variability of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease in Slovenia: A Nationwide Study.
PG  - 921730
LID - 10.1155/2015/921730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to determine the incidence rate of
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) and its trends for the period of
      2002-2010 and to assess the geographical distribution of PIBD in Slovenia.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients (0-18 years) with newly
      diagnosed IBD during the study period were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The
      mean incidence rate for IBD in 2002-2010 was 7.6 per 100,000 children and
      adolescents per year, 4.5 for Crohn's disease (CD), 2.9 for ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 0.2 for IBD-unclassified, respectively. The incidence rate increased
      from 5.8 per 100,000 per year in 2002-2004 to 8.6 in 2005-2007 and remained
      stable afterwards. Statistically significant difference in the incidence rate
      between the Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country was observed (p = 
      0.025). CONCLUSION: This nationwide study demonstrates that Slovenia is among the
      European countries with the highest PIBD incidence. During the study period a
      substantial rise of PIBD incidence was observed during the first half of the
      study and it seems to have stabilized in the second half. The significant
      difference in PIBD incidence between Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the
      country merits further exploration of the possible environmental factors.

TI  - Guideline for wireless capsule endoscopy in children and adolescents: A consensus
      document by the SEGHNP (Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition) and the SEPD (Spanish Society for Digestive Diseases).
PG  - 714-31
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) in children has limitations based mainly on 
      age. The objective of this consensus was reviewing the scientific evidence.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Some experts from the Spanish Society of Gastroenterology
      (SEPD) and Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and
      Nutrition (SEGHNP) were invited to answer different issues about CE in children. 
      These sections were: a) Indications, contraindications and limitations; b)
      efficacy of CE in different clinical scenarios; c) CE performance; d) CE-related 
      complications; e) Patency Capsule; and f) colon capsule endoscopy. They reviewed 
      relevant questions on each topic. RESULTS: The main indication is Crohn's disease
      (CD). There is no contraindication for the age and in the event that the patient 
      not to swallow it, it should be administered under deep sedation with endoscopy
      and specific device. The CE is useful in CD, for the management of OGIB in
      children and in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (in this indication has the most
      effectiveness). The main complication is retention, which should be specially
      taken into account in cases of CD already diagnosed with malnutrition. A
      preparation regimen based on a low volume of polyethylene glycol (PEG) the day
      before plus simethicone on the same day is the best one in terms of cleanliness
      although does not improve the results of the CE procedure. CONCLUSIONS: CE is
      safe and useful in children. Indications are similar to those of adults, the main
      one is CD to establish both a diagnosis and disease extension. Moreover, only few
      limitations are detected in children.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic illness of unknown etiology. The 
      consequences that CD causes nutritionally depend on several factors. However,
      little is known about the nutritional practices that CD affected people adopt
      once diagnosed. OBJECTIVE: to explore the experience of those affected in
      relation to food intake, with the future goal of understanding those experiences 
      and design effective and appropriate interventions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: a
      qualitative design based on ethnographic approach was used. 19 semi-structured
      interviews were conducted in Alicante, until data saturation was reached and
      later the analysis of categories and subcategories was developed. RESULTS: 5
      categories with their subcategories were identified from the data collected on
      the experience of feeding: 1) Beliefs about nutrition and CD, 2) Changing eating 
      habits, 3) Finding information about food and CD, 4) The role of professionals,
      5) Self-management. CONCLUSIONS: knowledge of the dietary habits of the person
      with CD, may provide professional workforce with the appropriate information for 
      management and support in terms of prevention, health promotion and health
      education, useful for the organization of health institutions, where those things
      are not usually taken into account since the CD approach is purely based on
      clinical and pathological aspects. Consequently, it appears a need of a new CD
      perspective based on health, focused on promoting healthy habits and from a
      multidisciplinary approach.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

TI  - Specific carbohydrate diet for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in clinical
      practice within an academic IBD center.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Enteral Feeding Therapy for Maintaining Remission in Crohn's Disease: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 550-561
LID - 10.1177/0148607115621051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) for maintaining remission in
      patients with inactive Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear. The aim of this article
      was to systematically identify, review, and critically appraise the evidence on
      efficacy of EN in maintaining medically induced remission in CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Several databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for
      relevant citations of published randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized
      cohort studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion and
      assessed study quality and risk of bias. The primary outcome was relapse rate in 
      patients with inactive CD who have been in medically induced remission and
      subsequently started or maintained on EN. RESULTS: Twelve studies (1169 patients,
      including 95 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. As the included studies 
      were significantly heterogeneous, a meta-analysis was not performed. Eleven
      studies showed that EN was either better than, or as effective as, the comparator
      in maintaining remission in patients with inactive CD. No major EN-related
      adverse events were reported. Only 1 adult randomized controlled trial (n = 51), 
      with low risk of bias, compared EN with regular diet and found a relapse rate of 
      34% in the EN group versus 64% in the control group ( P < .01) after a mean
      follow-up of 11.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: EN is more effective than regular diet and
      as effective as some medications in maintaining remission for patients with
      inactive CD. Large, properly designed randomized controlled studies of sufficient
      duration are required to confirm this conclusion for EN versus individual
      medications.

TI  - A snapshot of the nutritional status of Crohn's disease among adolescents in
      Brazil: a prospective cross-sectional study.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0403-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) is
      complex and involves several therapeutic possibilities including: nutrition
      treatment for malnourished patients, optimization of growth and development,
      prevention of osteoporosis, first-line therapy for active disease, and
      maintenance of disease remission. In children and adolescents with CD,
      malnutrition is a common problem that adversely affects the prognosis. In at-risk
      adolescent CD patients, it is important to assess body composition, food intake, 
      energy expenditure, nutrient balance and serum levels of nutrients before
      planning interventions for this population. The aim of this study was to provide 
      a snapshot of the nutritional status of adolescents with CD in Brazil. METHODS:
      We prospectively selected 22 patients with mildly to moderately active CD, 29
      patients with inactive CD and 35 controls (first-degree relatives of and in the
      same age bracket as the CD patients). The age range of participants was between
      13.2 and 19.4 years old. We collected anthropometric data including weight,
      height, and body mass index (BMI), which were expressed as Z scores:
      weight-for-age, height-for-age and BMI-for-age, respectively, as well as using
      bioimpedance to determine body composition and assessing the Tanner stage. We
      also assessed macronutrients and micronutrients (serum levels and dietary intake 
      of both). We used the chi-square test to determine whether any of the studied
      variables were associated with inactive or active CD. The level of significance
      was set at 5 % (p < 0.05). We have written informed parental consent for
      participation for any minors and written informed consent for any participants
      that were adults. RESULTS: The mean values for lean body mass, Tanner stage,
      height-for-age Z score and BMI-for-age Z score were lower in the active CD group 
      than in the inactive CD and control groups (p < 0.05 for both). Compared with the
      controls, the CD patients showed significant differences in terms of the quality 
      of dietary intake (particularly in caloric intake, dietary protein intake,
      dietary fiber intake, and micronutrient intake), which were reflected in the
      serum levels of nutrients, mainly vitamins A and E (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Adolescents with CD (including those with mildly to moderately active or inactive
      disease) have a nutritional risk, which makes it important to conduct nutritional
      assessments in such patients.

AB  - Ideally, surgical patients should be nutritionally optimized, as better
      nutritional status correlates with favorable outcomes during the perioperative
      period. As inflammatory bowel disease often leads to overall malnutrition,
      special consideration should be given to this patient population by surgeons. In 
      this article, we review methods for nutritional assessment and provide
      nutritional recommendations for this special surgical population.

TI  - Azathioprine is effective for oral involvement in Crohn's disease but not for
      orofacial granulomatosis alone.
PG  - 312-8
LID - 10.1111/jop.12379 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been no previous reports assessing the effectiveness of
      azathioprine (AZA) in the treatment of orofacial granulomatosis (OFG). This
      report is a review of patients receiving AZA for active OFG with or without
      concomitant gut Crohn's disease (CD) in a specialist tertiary referral centre.
      METHODS: Clinical response was defined by Global Physician Assessment at 4-, 12- 
      and 24-month follow-up and a standardised oral disease activity score (ODAS).
      RESULTS: Sixty of 215 patients seen with OFG in our clinic over a 12-year period 
      were treated with AZA. Of these, 22 had concomitant CD. The proportion of
      patients responding to AZA with a diagnosis of CD/OFG vs. OFG only at 4, 12 and
      24 months were 54% vs. 21% (P = 0.03), 59% vs. 21% (P = 0.003) and 41% vs. 24% (P
      = 0.16), respectively. A statistically significant difference was seen between
      starting and follow-up ODAS scores at 4 months in the CD/OFG group which was not 
      observed in the OFG only group. Factors predicting a need for AZA included a
      diagnosis of intestinal CD, sulcal swelling, sulcal ulcers and upper lip
      involvement. The factor predicting response to treatment was a diagnosis of CD at
      12 months of follow-up. No difference in the number of adverse effects was
      observed between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: AZA is significantly
      more effective in the treatment of oral disease with a concurrent diagnosis of CD
      rather than in the treatment of OFG alone.

TI  - Fungal Dysbiosis in Mucosa-associated Microbiota of Crohn's Disease Patients.
PG  - 296-305
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gut microbiota is involved in many physiological functions
      and its imbalance is associated with several diseases, particularly with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Mucosa-associated microbiota could have a key role
      in induction of host immunity and in inflammatory process. Although the role of
      fungi has been suggested in inflammatory disease pathogenesis, the fungal
      microbiota has not yet been deeply explored. Here we analysed the bacterial and
      fungal composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of Crohn's disease
      patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Our prospective, observational study
      evaluated bacterial and fungal composition of mucosa-associated microbiota of 23 
      Crohn's disease patients [16 in flare, 7 in remission] and 10 healthy subjects,
      using 16S [MiSeq] and ITS2 [pyrosequencing] sequencing, respectively. Global
      fungal load was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      RESULTS: Bacterial microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was characterised by a 
      restriction in biodiversity. with an increase of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria.
      Global fungus load was significantly increased in Crohn's disease flare compared 
      with healthy subjects [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the colonic mucosa-associated
      fungal microbiota was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla.
      Cystofilobasidiaceae family and Candida glabrata species were overrepresented in 
      Crohn's disease. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Filobasidium uniguttulatum species 
      were associated with non-inflamed mucosa, whereas Xylariales order was associated
      with inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the alteration of the
      bacterial microbiota and is the first demonstration of the existence of an
      altered fungal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that fungi may 
      play a role in pathogenesis.

TI  - Preoperative Intra-abdominal Sepsis, Not Penetrating Behavior Itself, Is
      Associated With Worse Postoperative Outcome After Bowel Resection for Crohn
      Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1987
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001987 [doi]
AB  - It is generally believed that penetrating behavior is associated with worse
      surgical outcomes in Crohn disease (CD). We hypothesized that intra-abdominal
      sepsis (IAS), but not penetrating behavior itself, contributes to postoperative
      morbidity in patients undergoing bowel resection for CD.Patients who underwent
      surgery from April 2010 to April 2014 were retrospectively identified from a
      prospectively maintained database. Demographic information and preoperative and
      operative data were collected. The outcomes following surgery in patients who had
      penetrating disease with or without IAS versus nonpenetrating CD were compared.Of
      288 patients, 180 had penetrating CD, including 54 who had IAS. Preoperative
      characteristics were similar between the groups, except for serum albumin,
      abdominal drainage, and prior bowel resection. Patients with penetrating CD with 
      IAS were more likely to have a stoma, surgical site complications, postoperative 
      IAS complications, and major complications than patients with penetrating CD
      without IAS or nonpenetrating CD. There were no significant differences between
      patients with penetrating CD without IAS and nonpenetrating CD. The postoperative
      outcome was strengthened after propensity-score matching analysis. Moreover,
      penetrating CD with IAS (odds ratio [OR], 13.034; P = 0.004) is a risk predictor 
      for major postoperative complications, and preoperative serum albumin (OR, 0.095;
      P = 0.002) and preoperative enteral nutrition (OR, 0.203, P = 0.049) are
      protective.Penetrating CD without IAS did not adversely affect postoperative
      outcome after bowel resection compared with penetrating CD with IAS. These
      results may revise the notion that all patients with penetrating CD have worse
      postoperative complications.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is rapidly increasing in children so an up to date knowledge
      of diagnosis, investigation and management is essential. Exclusive enteral
      nutrition is the first line treatment for active disease. The vast majority of
      children will need immunosuppressant treatment and around 20% will need treatment
      with biologics. Recent guidelines have helped make best use of available
      therapies.

AB  - Surgical treatment is primarily used to treat complications of Crohn's disease
      but also to improve the quality of life. An adequate preoperative preparation
      including improvement of the nutritional status, weaning off or stopping
      immunosuppressive medication and preoperative drainage of abscesses can decrease 
      the complication rate. With the exception of when neoplasia is present,
      bowel-sparing techniques (e. g. strictureplasty and limited resection) are now
      standard, which has resulted in a low risk of short bowel syndrome. The
      laparoscopic approach is possible for most indications even in the case of
      recurrent disease, in primary ileocecal resection the laparoscopic approach has
      been shown to be superior to the open approach. None of the available techniques 
      for anastomotic reconstruction of the bowels has been shown to be superior. A
      drainage seton is a good option to retain the quality of life in complex fistulas
      and reconstructive repair should only be considered when the rectum is free from 
      inflammation.

      During Exclusive Enteral Nutrition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exploring associations between the gut microbiota and colonic
      inflammation and assessing sequential changes during exclusive enteral nutrition 
      (EEN) may offer clues into the microbial origins of Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: Fecal samples (n=117) were collected from 23 CD and 21 healthy children.
      From CD children fecal samples were collected before, during EEN, and when
      patients returned to their habitual diets. Microbiota composition and functional 
      capacity were characterized using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and shotgun
      metagenomics. RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in CD than controls before
      EEN (P=0.006); differences were observed in 36 genera, 141 operational taxonomic 
      units (OTUs), and 44 oligotypes. During EEN, the microbial diversity of CD
      children further decreased, and the community structure became even more
      dissimilar than that of controls. Every 10 days on EEN, 0.6 genus diversity
      equivalents were lost; 34 genera decreased and one increased during EEN. Fecal
      calprotectin correlated with 35 OTUs, 14 of which accounted for 78% of its
      variation. OTUs that correlated positively or negatively with calprotectin
      decreased during EEN. The microbiota of CD patients had a broader functional
      capacity than healthy controls, but diversity decreased with EEN. Genes involved 
      in membrane transport, sulfur reduction, and nutrient biosynthesis differed
      between patients and controls. The abundance of genes involved in biotin
      (P=0.005) and thiamine biosynthesis decreased (P=0.017), whereas those involved
      in spermidine/putrescine biosynthesis (P=0.031), or the shikimate pathway
      (P=0.058), increased during EEN. CONCLUSIONS: Disease improvement following
      treatment with EEN is associated with extensive modulation of the gut microbiome.

TI  - Quality of Life in Swiss Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Do
      Patients and Their Parents Experience Disease in the Same Way?
PG  - 269-76
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) may impair quality of
      life (QoL) in paediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate in a nationwide cohort
      whether patients experience QoL in a different way when compared with their
      parents. METHODS: Sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were
      prospectively acquired from paediatric patients and their parents included in the
      Swiss IBD Cohort Study. Disease activity was evaluated by the Paediatric Crohn's 
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI). We assessed QoL using the KIDSCREEN questionnaire. The QoL domains
      were analysed and compared between children and parents according to type of
      disease, parents' age, origin, education and marital status. RESULTS: We included
      110 children and parents (59 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 6 
      IBD unclassified [IBDU]). There was no significant difference in QoL between CD
      and UC/IBDU, whether the disease was active or in remission. Parents perceived
      overall QoL, as well as 'mood', 'family' and 'friends' domains, lower than the
      children themselves, independently of their place of birth and education.
      However, better concordance was found on 'school performance' and 'physical
      activity' domains. Marital status and age of parents significantly influenced the
      evaluation of QoL. Mothers and fathers being married or cohabiting perceived
      significantly lower mood, family and friends domains than their children, whereas
      mothers living alone had a lower perception of the friends domain; fathers living
      alone had a lower perception of family and mood subscores. CONCLUSION: Parents of
      Swiss paediatric IBD patients significantly underestimate overall QoL and domains
      of QoL of their children independently of origin and education.

TI  - Association Between Long-Term Lipid Profiles and Disease Severity in a Large
      Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 865-71
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3932-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to an increased risk
      of coronary heart disease and stroke. Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      long-term lipid profiles in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Data of
      patients from an IBD registry who had more than one measurement of total
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were analyzed.
      The lipid profiles of IBD patients were compared to those of the general
      population according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (2009-2012). Quartiles of cholesterol or triglyceride levels in relation to
      surrogate markers of disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven hundred and
      one IBD patients [54% Crohn's disease (CD), 46% ulcerative colitis (UC)] were
      included. IBD patients had less frequent high total cholesterol and high LDL
      cholesterol (6 vs. 13 and 5 vs. 10%) and more frequent low HDL and high
      triglycerides (24 vs. 17 and 33 vs. 25%) compared to the general population (all 
      p < 0.001). Median total cholesterol levels were lower and median triglycerides
      higher in CD compared to UC (171 vs. 184; 123 vs. 100 mg/dL; both p < 0.001). In 
      the multiple regression analysis, lipid profile was independently associated with
      hospitalizations (low cholesterol) and IBD surgeries (low cholesterol and high
      triglycerides). CONCLUSIONS: Low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels
      are more frequent in IBD patients (in particular CD) compared to healthy controls
      and are independently associated with more severe disease.

TI  - IBD Genetic Risk Profile in Healthy First-Degree Relatives of Crohn's Disease
      Patients.
PG  - 209-15
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing
      inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives
      [FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional
      information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD 
      susceptibility observed in FDR. METHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related 
      FDR; n = 4997 independent CD; and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied.
      Genotyping for 158 IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was
      performed using the Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences 
      between FDR and HC cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. 
      CD and IBD genetic risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC,
      FDR, and CD cohorts. RESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC
      cohorts were strongly correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation
      coefficient 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). 
      There was a significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD
      cohorts: 0.0244, 0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each
      comparison]. There was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and
      FDR cohorts [p = 0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared 
      with FDR and HC cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison]. CONCLUSION: FDR
      of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles compared with HC.
      Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR compared with HC.
      Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping would facilitate
      better risk stratification of FDR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been
      determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163
      susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association
      study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between
      diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries
      in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification
      system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713
      with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip
      array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic
      variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all
      known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of
      genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the
      hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative
      colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify 
      patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile.
      FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients
      (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, 
      MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up
      of 10.5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which
      changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location
      and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for 
      inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype
      (p=1.65 x 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9.23 x
      10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly
      distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could
      also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles
      who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up
      (p=6.8 x 10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders
      within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal
      Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an
      intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the 
      major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time. FUNDING: International

TI  - Sexually transmitted infectious colitis vs inflammatory bowel disease:
      distinguishing features from a case-controlled study.
PG  - 771-81
LID - 10.1309/AJCPOID4JIJ6PISC [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infectious (STI) colitis often raises concern
      for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we compare histologic
      features of IBD with STI colitis caused by syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum.
      METHODS: The STI colitis group included 10 unique colorectal biopsy specimens in 
      patients with clinically confirmed syphilis and/or lymphogranuloma venereum. The 
      STI biopsy specimens were compared with patients matched for age, sex, and site
      with Crohn disease (n = 10) or ulcerative colitis (n = 10). All IBD controls had 
      an established history of IBD (up to 276 months of follow-up, mean follow-up =
      102 months). RESULTS: Discriminating features (P < .05) of STI colitis included
      its exclusive identification in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men who
      have sex with men, anal pain, and anal discharge. STI colitis contained the triad
      of (1) minimal active chronic crypt centric damage, (2) a lack of mucosal
      eosinophilia, and (3) submucosal plasma cells, endothelial swelling, and
      perivascular plasma cells. Nondiscriminating features (P > .05) included rectal
      bleeding, endoscopic appearance, skip lesions, ulcerations, aphthoid lesions,
      granulomata, foreign body giant cells, neural hyperplasia, fibrosis, and lymphoid
      aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: While STI colitis shares many overlapping features with 
      IBD, histologic and clinical discriminating features may be helpful when
      confronted with that differential diagnosis.

AB  - Down-regulation of immune-mediated angiogenesis seems to be an important
      mechanism in anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy for Crohn's
      disease (CD). However, it remains to be established whether the baseline
      pro-angiogenic activity as reflected by the level of vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF) could be of predictive value for successful clinical outcome of
      such treatment. Here, the levels of serum VEGF and other crucial
      angiogenesis-regulating peptides were assessed before and after induction
      anti-TNFalpha therapy in CD patients, and in age- and sex-matched healthy
      controls. Clinical, endoscopic, and biochemical activity of CD was estimated in
      parallel. CD patients were divided into two subgroups, depending on baseline VEGF
      levels: a "low-VEGF" subgroup with VEGF levels similar to those detected in
      healthy people, and a "high-VEGF" subgroup with VEGF levels significantly
      increased. VEGF levels were found to significantly correlate with CD clinical
      activity. Compared to the "low-VEGF" subgroup, the reduction in CD clinical
      activity as assessed by Crohn's Disease Activity Index was significantly greater 
      in "high-VEGF" patients both in absolute numbers, and as a percentage of
      pre-treatment values. Accordingly, the fraction of patients who did not respond
      adequately to treatment was significantly greater in the "low-VEGF" group. These 
      data indicate that VEGF may serve as an additional marker of CD activity and that
      baseline VEGF levels can be helpful in predicting the efficacy of anti-TNFalpha
      therapy.

TI  - Prevalence of Sarcopenia and Its Impact on Postoperative Outcome in Patients With
      Crohn's Disease Undergoing Bowel Resection.
PG  - 592-600
LID - 10.1177/0148607115612054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia has been proposed to be a prognostic factor of outcomes
      for various diseases but has not been applied to Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed
      to assess the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative outcomes after bowel
      resection in patients with CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal computed
      tomography images within 30 days before bowel resection in 114 patients with CD
      between May 2011 and March 2014 were assessed for sarcopenia as well as visceral 
      fat areas and subcutaneous fat areas. The impact of sarcopenia on postoperative
      outcomes was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of
      114 patients, 70 (61.4%) had sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had a lower
      body mass index, lower preoperative levels of serum albumin, and more major
      complications (15.7% vs 2.3%, P = .027) compared with patients without
      sarcopenia. Moreover, predictors of major postoperative complications were
      sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR], 9.24; P = .04) and a decreased skeletal muscle index
      (1.11; P = .023). Preoperative enteral nutrition (OR, 0.13; P = .004) and
      preoperative serum albumin level >35 g/L (0.19; P = .017) were protective factors
      in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sarcopenia is high in
      patients with CD requiring bowel resection. It significantly increases the risk
      of major postoperative complications and has clinical implications with respect
      to nutrition management before surgery for CD.

AB  - Abnormal composition of intestinal bacteria--"dysbiosis"-is characteristic of
      Crohn's disease. Disease treatments include dietary changes and immunosuppressive
      anti-TNFalpha antibodies as well as ancillary antibiotic therapy, but their
      effects on microbiota composition are undetermined. Using shotgun metagenomic
      sequencing, we analyzed fecal samples from a prospective cohort of pediatric
      Crohn's disease patients starting therapy with enteral nutrition or anti-TNFalpha
      antibodies and reveal the full complement and dynamics of bacteria, fungi,
      archaea, and viruses during treatment. Bacterial community membership was
      associated independently with intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and
      therapy. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased dysbiosis, whereas
      dysbiosis decreased with reduced intestinal inflammation. Fungal proportions
      increased with disease and antibiotic use. Dietary therapy had independent and
      rapid effects on microbiota composition distinct from other stressor-induced
      changes and effectively reduced inflammation. These findings reveal that
      dysbiosis results from independent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotics
      and shed light on Crohn disease treatments.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman with Crohn's disease, who had been on home parenteral
      nutrition for many years, presented with perioral paraesthesia and a burning
      sensation in the mouth. Initial blood tests including serum ferritin, vitamin B12
      and folate, were normal apart from mild pancytopaenia. Serum copper was low, in
      spite of receiving regular copper in her parenteral feeds. The copper in her
      parenteral feeds was increased initially, but when it did not improve, she was
      started on weekly intravenous copper infusions. She was using dental adhesive,
      which had zinc in it, and a possibility that this was causing her copper
      deficiency was raised. Serum zinc levels were normal, but urinary zinc was very
      high. The patient was advised to use zinc-free dental adhesive and her copper
      level returned to normal within a few months with normalisation of her
      pancytopaenia, and partial resolution of her oral paraesthesia.

      bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the
      role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal
      manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and
      genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those
      with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the
      NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina
      whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with
      available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic 
      data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were
      common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13),
      respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional
      non-ocular-EIM [for >/= 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with
      O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear
      polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of
      significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur
      with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally
      associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these
      results and identify additional genes.

TI  - Influence of nutritional status on the therapeutic effect of infliximab in
      patients with Crohn's disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: Crohn's disease (CD) is a refractory inflammatory bowel disease of
      unknown etiology, frequently complicated by malnutrition. It is thought that the 
      delayed wound healing associated with this malnutrition in CD patients might
      adversely affect the therapeutic benefits of infliximab (IFX). Therefore, we
      investigated the effects of nutritional status on IFX treatment. METHODS: We
      assessed nutritional status and CD activity when IFX therapy was initiated and
      following the third dose, 6 weeks later. Nutritional status was assessed using
      the body mass index (BMI) and nutritional risk index (NRI), whereas CD activity
      was assessed using the CD activity index (CDAI). RESULTS: All patients with a BMI
      >/= 18.5 kg/m(2) at the time of IFX therapy met the effective criteria for the
      CDAI, and IFX treatment was considered responsive in these patients. Furthermore,
      IFX treatment was responsive, with a high level of effectiveness, in all five
      subjects (31.3 %) with NRI scores of 97.5 and above with no risk of malnutrition 
      (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that nutritional status does
      influence the therapeutic effect of IFX in CD patients. The response rate to IFX 
      treatment thus could be improved by optimizing the nutritional status. We
      recommend comprehensive nutritional assessment and intervention prior to IFX
      treatment schedules.

TI  - Defects in 15-HETE Production and Control of Epithelial Permeability by Human
      Enteric Glial Cells From Patients With Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 168-80
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.09.038 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(15)01394-3 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Enteric glial cells (EGCs) produce soluble mediators that
      regulate homeostasis and permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB).
      We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites
      produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared 
      with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites,
      15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the
      IEB. METHODS: We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal
      resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal
      tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (controls).
      EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography
      tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to 
      identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs
      and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB 
      were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were
      measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using 
      short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given 
      intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the
      enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was
      measured. RESULTS: EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of
      15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE
      production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs
      from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the
      addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues.
      Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in
      colon tissues. We found that 15-HETE regulates IEB permeability by inhibiting an 
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of
      zonula occludens-1. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric glial cells from patients with CD have
      reduced production of 15-HETE, which controls IEB permeability by inhibiting
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of
      zonula occludens-1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use patterns and effects in patients with Inflammatory Bowel 
      Disease have been extensively studied, however the role and patterns of cannabis 
      use remains poorly defined. Our aim was to evaluate patterns of marijuana use in 
      a large population based survey. METHODS: Cases were identified from the NHANES
      database from the National Center for Health Statistics for the time period from 
      January, 2009 through December, 2010 as having ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease, and exact matched with controls using the Propensity Score Module of
      SPSS, based on age, gender, and sample weighted using the nearest neighbor
      method. RESULTS: After weighting, 2084,895 subjects with IBD and 2013,901 control
      subjects were identified with no significant differences in demographic
      characteristics. Subjects with IBD had a higher incidence of ever having used
      marijuana/hashish (M/H) (67.3% vs. 60.0%) and an earlier age of onset of M/H use 
      (15.7 years vs. 19.6 years). Patients with IBD were less likely to have used M/H 
      every month for a year, but more likely to use a heavier amount per day (64.9%
      subjects with IBD used three or more joints per day vs. 80.5% of subjects without
      IBD used two or fewer joints per day). In multivariable logistic regression,
      presence of IBD, male gender, and age over 40 years predicted M/H use.
      CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to evaluate marijuana patterns in a
      large-scale population based survey. Older, male IBD patients have the highest
      odds of marijuana use.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous
      disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only 
      a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by
      genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic
      regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide 
      DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity. METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 
      39 controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and
      functional validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time
      polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top differentially
      methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained 
      from paediatric IBD cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were
      differentially methylated between CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were
      differentially methylated between UC cases and controls. There was considerable
      (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC
      differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was also
      significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC patients. In
      addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using pyrosequencing and found
      reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      provide new insights into differential epigenetic regulation of genes and
      molecular pathways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and activity of IBD.

TI  - Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 576-81
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000226 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies
      are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies
      are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The
      present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding 
      micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient
      deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are
      deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc,
      vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than 
      in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission.
      Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of
      disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis 
      of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and
      vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory 
      state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial.
      The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, 
      and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY:
      Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High
      suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of
      morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are
      prevented.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn
      disease, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract most
      often diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood, with a rising incidence in
      pediatric populations. These disorders are common enough in children that most
      pediatricians and other pediatric clinicians will encounter children with IBD in 
      their general practice. Inflammatory bowel disease is caused by a dysregulated
      mucosal immune response to the intestinal microflora in genetically predisposed
      hosts. Although children can present with the classic symptoms of weight loss,
      abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, many present with nonclassic symptoms of
      isolated poor growth, anemia, or other extraintestinal manifestations. Once IBD
      is diagnosed, the goals of therapy consist of eliminating symptoms, normalizing
      quality of life, restoring growth, and preventing complications while minimizing 
      the adverse effects of medications. Unique considerations when treating children 
      and adolescents with IBD include attention to the effects of the disease on
      growth and development, bone health, and psychosocial functioning. The purpose of
      this review is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiologic features, 
      pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of IBD in children and adolescents.

TI  - Increased catabolism and decreased unsaturation of ganglioside in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 10080-90
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i35.10080 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether accelerated catabolism of ganglioside and decreased
      ganglioside content contribute to the etiology of pro-inflammatory intestinal
      disease. METHODS: Intestinal mucosa from terminal ileum or colon was obtained
      from patients with ulcerative colitis or inflammatory Crohn's disease (n = 11)
      undergoing bowel resection and compared to control samples of normal intestine
      from patients with benign colon polyps (n = 6) and colorectal cancer (n = 12) in 
      this observational case-control study. Gangliosides and phospholipids of
      intestinal mucosa were characterized by class and ceramide or fatty acid
      composition using liquid chromatography triple-quad mass spectrometry. Content
      and composition of ganglioside classes GM1, GM3, GD3, GD1a, GT1 and GT3 were
      compared among subject groups. Content and composition of phospholipid classes
      phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine were compared among subject
      groups. Unsaturation index of individual ganglioside and phospholipid classes was
      computed and compared among subject groups. Ganglioside catabolism enzymes
      beta-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) and sialidase-3 (NEU3) were measured in intestinal
      mucosa using western blot and compared among subject groups. RESULTS: Relative
      GM3 ganglioside content was 2-fold higher (P < 0.05) in intestine from patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to control intestine. The quantity
      of GM3 and ratio of GM3/GD3 was also higher in IBD intestine than control tissue 
      (P < 0.05). Control intestine exhibited 3-fold higher (P < 0.01) relative GD1a
      ganglioside content than IBD intestine. GD3 and GD1a species of ganglioside
      containing three unsaturated bonds were present in control intestine, but were
      not detected in IBD intestine. The relative content of PC containing more than
      two unsaturated bonds was 30% lower in IBD intestine than control intestine (P < 
      0.05). The relative content of HEXA in IBD intestine was increased 1.7-fold (P < 
      0.05) and NEU3 was increased 8.3-fold (P < 0.01) compared to normal intestine.
      Intestinal mucosa in IBD is characterized by increased GM3 content, decreased
      GD1a, and a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid constituents in GD3, GD1a and
      PC. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a new paradigm by proposing that IBD occurs
      as a consequence of increased metabolism of specific gangliosides.

TI  - Fecal pyruvate kinase is not suitable for discrimination between inflammatory
      bowel disease exacerbation and acute gastroenteritis.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) diarrhea can be caused by
      exacerbation and/or infectious agents. Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a
      well-established biomarker of intestinal inflammation in IBD. However, its
      usefulness in depiction of IBD exacerbation from infectious diarrhea is limited. 
      The value of fecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type 2 (M2-PK) in this application
      remains unknown. AIM: To compare the performance of M2-PK and FC in
      discriminating between diarrhea caused by IBD and infectious agents. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: One hundred three patients were enrolled for the study, including 32
      with ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 with Crohn's disease (CD), 29 with acute
      diarrhea caused by rotavirus (AD-RV), and 21 with acute diarrhea caused by
      Salmonella enteritidis (AD-SE). M2-PK and FC were measured using ELISA. Areas
      under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities and
      specificities for both tests in distinguishing between patient subgroups with
      moderate to severe UC and CD from AD-RV and AD-SE were calculated. RESULTS:
      Differences in AUCs between M2-PK and FC for distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV
      were -0.06 (p < 0.028) [-0.10 (p < 0.0018)] and for differentiating UC [CD] from 
      AD-SE were 0.03 (NS) [-0.19(p < 0.0011)].M2-PK sensitivities and specificities in
      distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were 75.0%[71.4%] and 89.7% [89.7%] and for
      differentiation of UC [CD] from AD-SE were 56.3% [71.4%] and 95.2[57.1%].
      CONCLUSIONS: The performance of M2-PK in distinguishing between children with
      moderate-to-severe IBD and patients with infectious gastroenteritis was inferior 
      to FC. Neither test had sensitivity ands pecificity sufficient for everyday
      clinical application.

AB  - PURPOSE: Determination of overweight and obesity prevalence in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      This was a multicenter retrospective study. The study group consisted of children
      with new cases of IBD diagnosed in 2005-2013 according to the Porto criteria.
      Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical
      characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define
      overweight as >/=85th BMI percentile and obesity as >/=95th BMI percentile.
      RESULTS: 675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There
      were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease 
      activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values
      than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the 
      UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76-7.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12-4.59 and 8.47% 
      CI95 5.61-12.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77-3.88, respectively); the differences were
      statistically significant (-2.44% CI95 -5.45 to 0.49 and -6.57% CI95 -10 to -3.1,
      respectively). The risk of overweight/obesity was 3.5 times higher for patients
      with UC (OR=0.272, CI95 0.14-0.49, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of
      overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed children with IBD was 8.4% and was
      higher in patients with UC than in patients with CD. The results of this study
      have shown that not only malnourished children may suffer from IBD but also
      children who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis.

AB  - There is a close relationship between the human host and the intestinal
      microbiota, which is an assortment of microorganisms, protecting the intestine
      against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota 
      play a critical role in providing nutrition and the modulation of host immune
      homeostasis. Recent reports indicate that some strains of intestinal bacteria are
      responsible for intestinal ulceration and chronic inflammation in inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
      Understanding the interaction of the intestinal microbiota with pathogens and the
      human host might provide new strategies treating patients with IBD. This review
      focuses on the important role that the intestinal microbiota plays in maintaining
      innate immunity in the pathogenesis and etiology of UC and discusses new
      antibiotic therapies targeting the intestinal microbiota.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 541-5
LID - 10.18388/abp.2015_982 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of fecal lactoferrin in the
      diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. The
      study included 52 children with IBD (24 with Crohn's disease and 28 with
      ulcerative colitis) aged between 0.92 and 18 years, and 41 IBD-free controls of
      similar age. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin was determined with a
      quantitative immunoenzymatic test. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin in children
      with IBD was significantly higher than in the controls. The cut-off value of
      fecal lactoferrin concentration optimally distinguishing between the children
      with IBD and the controls was identified as 13 mug/g. The sensitivity and
      specificity of this cut-off value equaled 80.7% and 92.7%, respectively, and its 
      positive and negative prognostic values were 96.8% and 63.3%, respectively.
      Patients diagnosed with moderate Crohn's disease had significantly higher fecal
      concentrations of lactoferrin than children with the mild or inactive disease.
      Similarly, children with moderate ulcerative colitis showed significantly higher 
      fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than individuals with the mild condition. No 
      significant relationship was found between the fecal concentration of lactoferrin
      and the severity of endoscopic lesions. Patients with IBD and a positive result
      of fecal occult blood test were characterized by significantly higher
      concentrations of lactoferrin than the individuals with IBD and a negative result
      of this test. In conclusion, fecal concentration of lactoferrin seems to be a
      useful parameter for diagnosis and monitoring of IBD in children.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

TI  - Body Mass Index Is a Marker of Nutrition Preparation Sufficiency Before Surgery
      for Crohn's Disease From the Perspective of Intra-Abdominal Septic Complications:
      A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e1455
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001455 [doi]
AB  - Poor preoperative nutritional status for individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) is
      associated with intra-abdominal septic complications (IASCs). The present study
      aimed to investigate the association of the common nutrition indices serum
      albumin and body mass index (BMI) with IASCs. Sixty-four CD patients who had
      received elective intestinal operations were retrospectively investigated. Among 
      these patients, 32 had received individualized fortified nutrition support. IASCs
      occurred in 7 patients (10.9%). Compared with non-IASC patients, IASC patients
      had a lower BMI (17.6 +/- 2.7 vs 15.6 +/- 1.3 kg/m, P = 0.048). The area under
      the receiver operating characteristic curve according to the BMI-based IASC
      prediction was 0.772 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.601-0.944; P = 0.020) with 
      an optimum diagnostic cutoff value of 16.2 kg/m. A BMI < 16.2 kg/m significantly 
      increased the risk of developing an IASC (odds ratio [OR], 10.286; 95% CI,
      1.158-91.386). Even after correction with the simplified CD activity index
      (CDAI), a low BMI level remained associated with IASCs (OR, 7.650; 95% CI,
      0.808-72.427; P = 0.076). Serum albumin was not associated with IASCs. Although
      the fortified nutrition support group had an albumin level comparable to the
      control group, this group had a higher simplified CDAI score, a lower BMI level, 
      and a comparable incidence rate of IASCs. Thus, BMI more accurately reflects the 
      basic preoperative nutritional status of CD patients than serum albumin. BMI can 
      aid in guiding preoperative nutrition support and judging the appropriate
      operation time for CD.

AB  - Much has been written about the role of diet and risk for Crohn's disease (CD).
      However, the evidence is contradictory. Recent evidence has pointed to fiber
      playing an important role along with the possibility that dietary fat and
      overnutrition also have a role. Diet has a clearer place in disease modification,
      with some diets used in the treatment of CD. The lack of clarity stems from a
      poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between diet and
      CD. Gut permeability is likely to play a key role in the risk for CD. Mechanisms 
      whereby diet can affect gut permeability, including the effects of the gut
      microbiota, are reviewed. Modification of disease behavior is likely to be
      influenced by additional mechanisms, including recognition of complex food
      antigens. As with many other chronic diseases, a surrogate marker of CD risk
      would greatly aid evaluation of the dietary factors involved. Formal measures of 
      gut permeability are too cumbersome for large-scale use, but fecal calprotectin
      may be a convenient measure of this. There are only preliminary data on the
      effect of diet and microbiota composition on fecal calprotectin and these require
      further investigation.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease involves 2 major disorders, ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn disease, both of which are due to inflammatory dysregulation in the
      gastrointestinal tract. Although these disorders have many overlapping features
      in pathophysiology and management, our current understanding of inflammatory
      bowel disease has illuminated several distinguishing features of the 2 diseases. 
      This article highlights similarities and differences most applicable to a primary
      care physician's practice. Also detailed are disease-related and
      treatment-related complications, and routine health maintenance practices for the
      patient with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Vitamin D deficiency and risk factors in children with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 516-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship between vitamin D status and seasons,
      disease activity, disease location, growth and steroid treatment in children with
      Crohn's disease (CD). To search for the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in
      CD children. To discuss the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and treatments 
      of CD. METHOD: Sixty CD children (63.3% male) and 121 sex- and age-matched
      healthy subjects were enrolled. Data including growth, clinical characteristics, 
      time for vitamin D blood test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive
      protein, serum 25(OH)D concentration and steroid treatments were collected. The
      relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity, disease location,
      growth and steroid treatments in children with CD were analized. RESULT: The
      serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 57.2(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, which was
      significantly lower than that of controls (67.3 (57.3-78.4) nmol/L) (Z=-5.009,
      P=0.000). Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter and spring
      (November to April, 46.8(31.8-83.4) nmol/L) rather than summer and autumn (May to
      October, 63.3(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, Z=-1.994, P=0.046). Univariate logistic
      regression demonstrated that factors increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency 
      in Crohn's disease were: age over 10 years (OR=4.571, 95% CI: 1.452-14.389),
      small intestine involved diseases (OR=5.211, 95% CI: 1.278-21.237), high C
      reactive protein levels (>/=8 mg/L) (OR=4.500, 95% CI: 1.094-18.503) and steroid 
      therapy (OR=4.297, 95% CI: 1.413-13.068). Among those risk factors, all but age
      were determined to be risks of vitamin D deficiency by further multivariate
      logistic regression. There was no significant correlation between vitamin D
      deficiency and gender, disease duration, stricture, penetration, perianal disease
      (fistula, ulcer or abscess), white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, platelet
      counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin levels, pediatric Crohn's
      disease activity index and nutrition therapy (P>0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in children with CD. Serum concentration of
      vitamin D was associated with season. Steroid treatment, small intestine involved
      disease and high C reactive protein (more than 8 mg/L) are risk factors of
      vitamin D deficiency in CD children.

TI  - Prevalence and Risk Factors for Functional Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Patients
      with Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2839-47
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency due 
      to frequent involvement of the terminal ileum. Conventional screening for B12
      deficiency with serum B12 is relatively insensitive and measures total B12
      concentration, of which a minority is present in a biologically active form.
      Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) combined with methylmalonic acid (MMA) is believed to
      be more accurate in identifying impaired B12 status. We evaluated the prevalence 
      and risk factors for B12 deficiency using holoTC supported by MMA among patients 
      with CD. METHODS: We performed a single-center service evaluation of 381 patients
      with CD who underwent B12 assessment (holoTC/MMA) and compared them with 141
      patients with ulcerative colitis. Eighty-nine patients with CD underwent paired
      serum B12 and holoTC. Among patients with CD, risk factors including terminal
      ileal resection length, ileal inflammation on endoscopy, and disease
      characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded. RESULTS: Prevalence 
      of B12 deficiency among patients with CD was 33% compared with 16% in ulcerative 
      colitis (P < 0.0001). In 89 patients who underwent paired tests, conventional
      testing identified B12 deficiency in 5% of patients with CD, which increased to
      32% using holoTC/MMA. Independent risk factors for B12 deficiency were ileal
      resection length </=20 cm (odds ratio: 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.0, P =
      0.002) and >20 cm (odds ratio: 6.7, 95% confidence interval, 3.0-14.7, P <
      0.0001) and ileal inflammation (odds ratio: 3.9, 95% confidence interval,
      2.2-6.9, P < 0.0001). On magnetic resonance imaging, active terminal ileal
      inflammation (P = 0.02) and an increased disease burden (>/=1 skip lesion, P =
      0.01 and prestenotic dilatation >3 cm, P = 0.01) were associated with B12
      deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in patients with CD.
      holoTC supported by MMA identifies patients with B12 deficiency considered
      replete on conventional testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral manifestations are common in Crohn's disease (CD). Here we
      characterized the subgingival microbiota in pediatric patients with CD initiating
      therapy and after 8 weeks to identify microbial community features associated
      with CD and therapy. METHODS: Pediatric patients with CD were recruited from The 
      Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania. Healthy control subjects were recruited from
      primary care or orthopedics clinic. Subgingival plaque samples were collected at 
      initiation of therapy and after 8 weeks. Treatment exposures included 5-ASAs,
      immunomodulators, steroids, and infliximab. The microbiota was characterized by
      16S rRNA gene sequencing. The study was repeated in separate discovery (35 CD, 43
      healthy) and validation cohorts (43 CD, 31 healthy). RESULTS: Most subjects in
      both cohorts demonstrated clinical response after 8 weeks of therapy (discovery
      cohort 88%, validation cohort 79%). At week 0, both antibiotic exposure and
      disease state were associated with differences in bacterial community
      composition. Seventeen genera were identified in the discovery cohort as
      candidate biomarkers, of which 11 were confirmed in the validation cohort.
      Capnocytophaga, Rothia, and TM7 were more abundant in CD relative to healthy
      controls. Other bacteria were reduced in abundance with antibiotic exposure among
      CD subjects. CD-associated genera were not enriched compared with healthy
      controls after 8 weeks of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival microbial community
      structure differed with CD and antibiotic use. Results in the discovery cohort
      were replicated in a separate validation cohort. Several potentially pathogenic
      bacterial lineages were associated with CD but were not diminished in abundance
      by antibiotic treatment, suggesting targets for additional surveillance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although medical management of Crohn's disease has changed in
      recent years, it is unclear whether surgical management has altered. We examined 
      rate changes of surgical interventions, stoma constructions, and subset of
      ileostomy and colostomy constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 1988 to 2011. We examined the number of
      Crohn's-related operations and stoma constructions, including ileostomies and
      colostomies; a multivariable logistic regression model was developed. RESULTS: A 
      total of 355,239 Crohn's-related operations were analyzed. Operations increased
      from 13,955 in 1988 to 17,577 in 2011, p < 0.001. Stoma construction increased
      from 2493 to 4283, p < 0.001. The subset of ileostomies increased from 1201 to
      3169, p < 0.001 while colostomies decreased from 1351 to 1201, p = 0.05.
      Operation percentages resulting in stoma construction increased from 18 to 24 %, 
      p < 0.001. Weight loss (OR 2.25, 95 % CI 1.88, 2.69) and presence of perianal
      fistulizing disease (OR 2.91, 95 % CI 2.31, 3.67) were most predictive for
      requiring stoma construction. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's-related surgical interventions
      and stoma constructions have increased. The largest predictors for stoma
      construction are weight loss and perianal fistulizing disease. As a result,
      nutrition should be optimized and the early involvement of a multidisciplinary
      team should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-operative recurrence is frequent in Crohn's disease.
      Genetic factors associated with post-operative recurrence remain poorly
      understood. Identification of genetic variants associated with repeat surgery
      would allow risk stratification of patients who may benefit from early aggressive
      therapy and/or post-operative prophylactic treatment. METHODS: Crohn's disease
      patients who had at least one bowel resection were retrospectively identified
      from the "Nancy IBD cohort". Covariates and potential interactions were assessed 
      using the Cox proportional hazard model. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to surgical
      recurrence were developed for 200 genetic variants and analyzed with the log-rank
      test. RESULTS: 137 patients had at least 1 resection in our cohort: 38 had a
      surgical recurrence (28%). In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (OR
      6.97, 95% CI 1.85-26.22, p=0.004), post-operative complications after prior
      surgery (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-7.22, p=0.044), and Caspase recruitment
      domain-containing protein 8 (CARD8) homozygosity for the risk allele (OR 7.56,
      95% CI 1.13-50.37, p=0.036) remained significantly and independently associated
      with surgical recurrence. CONCLUSION: Current smoker status was associated with
      increased risk of surgical recurrence. A novel association between CARD8 and
      increased risk of surgical recurrence in Crohn's disease was observed. CARD8
      could be a new marker for risk stratification and prevention of recurrent
      surgery.

TI  - Characterization of genetic loci that affect susceptibility to inflammatory bowel
      diseases in African Americans.
PG  - 1575-1586
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.07.065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in
      African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic
      susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the 
      number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution 
      of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We
      performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD
      susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new
      associated loci. METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls)
      from 34 IBD centers in the United States; additional controls were collected from
      4 other Immunochip studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088
      patients with Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type
      unknown, and 1797 controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) were analyzed. RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between
      ulcerative colitis and HLA rs9271366 (P = 7.5 x 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and
      5p13.1 rs4286721 (P = 3.5 x 10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P = 2.3 x
      10(-6)). Additional suggestive associations (P < 4.2 x 10(-5)) were observed
      between Crohn's disease and IBD and African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3;
      between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis
      and SNPs near HDAC11 and near LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been
      previously associated with IBD, but require replication. Established Caucasian
      associations were replicated in AAs (P < 3.1 x 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3,
      and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P < 3.9 x 10(-4)) was observed for
      17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3), 10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and
      16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed significant enrichment (false discovery 
      rate <1 x 10(-5)) in genes that encode members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and
      chemokine signaling pathways, as well those involved in pathogenesis of measles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found
      that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association
      evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci
      not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine
      risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver enzymes (LEs) abnormalities associated with pediatric
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are understudied. We undertook to describe the 
      development and associations of abnormal LEs in pediatric IBD. METHODS: We
      ascertained a cohort of 300 children with IBD and collected retrospective data. A
      Kaplan-Meier analysis determined the time to development of different thresholds 
      of abnormal LEs. Associations between clinical variables and the development of
      abnormal LEs were determined. RESULTS: The probability of developing the first
      episode of abnormal LEs above the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 150 months
      was 58.1% (16.3% by 1 mo post-IBD diagnosis). There was a 6% prevalence of
      primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC)
      in this cohort. Of those diagnosed with PSC/ASC, 93% had persistent LE elevations
      at a threshold of >2x ULN, while those without PSC/ASC had a 4% probability of
      this abnormality. Elevated gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels of 252 U/L had a
      99% sensitivity and 71% specificity for PSC/ASC in IBD. After exclusion of
      patients with PSC/ASC, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and exclusive enteral
      nutrition demonstrated strongly positive associations with the first development 
      of abnormal LEs >ULN (hazard ratio 2.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.3], hazard
      ratio 5.6 [95% confidence interval, 3.6-8.9], hazard ratio 4.2 [95% confidence
      interval, 1.6-11.3], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LEs are common in
      pediatric IBD and occur early. PSC/ASC is associated with persistently high LEs
      and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels >252 U/L. Children with IBD are at risk
      of elevated LEs if they require medications other than 5-ASA to induce IBD
      remission.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's
      disease: current status and future perspectives.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2348-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The value of enteral nutrition (EN) as maintenance therapy in patients
      with quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of 
      this study was to review the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Seven prospective cohort studies evaluating 
      the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in quiescent CD were
      included. Three of the seven studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In
      all studies, patients used EN as a supplement or as a nocturnal tube feeding in
      addition to their normal food. RESULTS: One study compared the efficacy of
      elemental diet and polymeric diet. Elemental and polymeric diets were equally
      effective for the maintenance of clinical remission and for allowing tapering and
      cessation of steroid therapy. The other six studies compared the outcomes between
      patients treated with and without EN. The maintained clinical remission rate at 1
      year was significantly higher in patients treated with EN in four of the six
      studies. Quantitative pooling of the studies was not feasible due to a small
      number of RCTs and a narrative account of the study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our review suggests that EN is useful for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. However, there are several limitations in the
      reviewed studies. There are few RCTs. Further, the sample size is small, and the 
      duration of intervention and follow-up is short. Large and well-designed RCTs
      should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of EN for maintaining
      remission.

TI  - Perioperative Parenteral Nutrition in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      Review of the Literature.
PG  - 159-70
LID - 10.1177/0884533615594011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with
      numerous nutrition implications, including an increased risk of malnutrition and 
      various nutrient deficiencies. Surgical interventions are often necessary in the 
      treatment of IBD, and patients with IBD presenting for surgery often have
      multiple issues, including acute inflammatory processes, malnutrition, anemia,
      and infections, which may increase the likelihood of poor surgical outcomes.
      Thus, determining adjunctive treatments that may decrease postoperative
      complications is paramount. Although enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the
      preferred nutrition support modality when the gastrointestinal tract is
      accessible and functional, parenteral nutrition (PN) may provide a suitable
      alternative when the use of EN is not feasible. The aim of this review is to
      evaluate the currently available literature on the impact of perioperative PN on 
      postoperative complications, disease severity, and nutrition status in adults
      with IBD. Six studies within the past 10 years investigated this topic and are
      analyzed here. Results indicate general trends toward improvements in
      postoperative outcomes, disease severity, and nutrition status associated with
      perioperative PN use. Although results appear promising, additional, larger
      studies with an emphasis on PN composition will improve our understanding of the 
      benefits of perioperative PN in adults with IBD.

TI  - Impact of Obesity on the Management and Clinical Course of Patients with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2857-63
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked with a proinflammatory state and the
      development of inflammatory diseases. Data on the clinical course and treatment
      of obese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are limited. We used an
      institutional IBD registry to investigate the impact of obesity on IBD severity
      and treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively
      collected data for 3 years (2009-2011). Patients with IBD were categorized by
      body mass index (BMI). IBD-related quality of life, biochemical markers of
      inflammation, comorbidities, health care utilization, and treatment were
      characterized. Obesity was defined as a BMI >/=30 (type I: 30-34.9, type II:
      35-39.9, and type III >/=40). RESULTS: Among 1494 patients with IBD, 71.9% were
      above their ideal BMI and 31.5% were obese. Obesity was more common in ulcerative
      colitis compared with patients with Crohn's disease (P = 0.04). Obese class II
      and class III patients were predominantly female. Obesity in IBD was associated
      with female gender (P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001), hypertension (P <
      0.001), hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001), poor quality of life (P < 0.0001), and
      increased rates of C-reactive protein elevation (P = 0.008). In logistic
      regression analysis, quality of life and C-reactive protein elevation were not
      independently correlated with obesity. There was no association between
      increasing BMI and annual prednisone use, emergency department visits,
      hospitalization, and surgery. Obesity was associated with lower milligrams per
      kilogram doses of purine analogs and biologics. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in IBD is
      not associated with increased health care utilization and IBD-related surgeries. 
      Optimal regimens for drug dosing in obese patients with IBD have yet to be
      defined.

TI  - Risk of Major Abdominal Surgery in an Asian Population-based Crohn's Disease
      Cohort.
PG  - 2625-33

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is increasing in incidence and prevalence in
      Asia, but there is a paucity of population-based studies on risk factors for
      surgery in Asian patients with CD. This will be useful to identify patients who
      may benefit from top-down treatment. This study describes the rates of abdominal 
      surgery and identifies associated risk factors in Singaporean patients with CD.
      METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. The medical records of
      Singaporeans diagnosed with CD from 1970 to 2013 were reviewed from 8 different
      hospitals in Singapore. The cumulative probability of CD-related abdominal
      surgery was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The logistic regression
      model was used to assess associations between independent risk factors and
      surgery. RESULTS: The cohort of 430 Singaporean patients with CD included 63.5%
      Chinese, 11.9% Malay, and 24.7% Indians, with a male to female ratio of 1.6;
      median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 2.9-13.0 yr) and median age at diagnosis
      30.5 years (range, 19.5-43.7 yr). One hundred twelve patients (26.0%) required
      major abdominal surgery: the cumulative risk of surgery was 14.9% at 90 days,
      21.2% at 5 years, 28.8% at 10 years, 38.3% at 20 years, and 50.6% at 30 years
      from diagnosis. Of the surgical patients, 75.0% were Chinese, 10.7% Malays, and
      14.3% Indians; 21.4% underwent surgery for inflammatory disease, 40.2% for
      stricturing disease, and 38.4% for penetrating disease. Age at diagnosis (A2
      17-40 yr, OR: 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-7.76), ileal disease (L1
      location, OR: 2.35, 95% CI, 1.14-5.0), stricturing (B2 OR: 6.09, 95% CI,
      3.20-11.8), and penetrating behavior (B3 OR: 21.6, 95% CI, 9.0-58.8) were
      independent risk factors for CD-related abdominal surgery. Indian patients were
      less likely to require surgery (OR: 0.40, 95% CI, 0.19-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Age at
      diagnosis, L1 location, B2, and B3 disease behavior are independent risk factors 
      for abdominal surgery. Interestingly, despite a higher prevalence of CD in
      Indians, a smaller proportion of Indian patients required surgery. These findings
      suggest that both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the risk of
      surgery in Asian patients with CD.

PG  - 2311-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies 
      of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet
      and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included
      women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school
      dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns
      (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We
      documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of 
      medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for
      confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC.
      RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases 
      of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a
      prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and
      fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio,
      0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater 
      intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with
      lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of
      CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was
      associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD,
      but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Food Intolerance: Associations with the rs12212067 Polymorphism of FOXO3 in
      Crohn's Disease Patients in New Zealand.
PG  - 70-80
LID - 10.1159/000435783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is known to play a major role in Crohn's disease (CD). It has
      also been reported that the minor G allele from the rs12212067 polymorphism (T>G)
      in FOXO3 is associated with milder CD. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the association between the rs12212067 polymorphism and food intolerances for a
      total of 253 foods. METHODS: Tolerances and intolerances were recorded on a
      self-reported dietary questionnaire. Each food was scored on a 5-point ordinal
      scale: beneficial effects as '+ +' or '+', adverse effects as '- -' or '-', and
      'makes no difference' as '='. Dietary and genotype data were available for a
      total of 283 CD patients. RESULTS: We identified 17 foods with beneficial effects
      in our study which were significantly associated with the G allele of the FOXO3
      rs12212067 polymorphism. Of these, sweet potatoes had the highest reported
      frequency of beneficial responses. We also identified 4 foods with detrimental
      effects in more than 25% of our study population. These were mustard, wasabi, and
      raw and cooked tomatoes, which again were significantly associated with the G
      allele in FOXO3. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence that adverse effects of
      mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes were significantly associated with
      the G allele of FOXO3 and that these foods should be avoided by people carrying
      this allele.

TI  - The Crohn's disease-associated polymorphism in ATG16L1 (rs2241880) reduces SHIP
      gene expression and activity in human subjects.
PG  - 452-61
LID - 10.1038/gene.2015.30 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a polygenic immune-mediated disease characterized by
      gastrointestinal inflammation. Mice deficient in the hematopoietic-restricted SH2
      domain-containing inositolpolyphosphate 5'-phosphatase (SHIP) develop spontaneous
      CD-like ileal inflammation. Intriguingly, SHIP mRNA is not upregulated in
      biopsies from patients with ileal CD despite immune cell infiltration, but SHIP's
      role in human CD remains unknown. We analyzed SHIP mRNA expression and activity
      in biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from control and
      treatment-naive subjects with ileal CD, and demonstrated that SHIP mRNA and
      activity were lower in hematopoietic cells in ileal biopsies and PBMCs from
      subjects with CD. In all tissues from our patient cohort and in PBMCs from a
      second healthy control cohort, subjects homozygous for the autophagy-related
      16-like protein (ATG16L1) CD-associated gene variant (rs2241880), had low SHIP
      mRNA expression and activity. SHIP protein expression increased during autophagy 
      and SHIP upregulation was dependent on ATG16L1 and/or autophagy, as well as the
      ATG16L1 CD-associated gene variant. Finally, homozygosity for the ATG16L1 risk
      variant and low SHIP mRNA expression is inversely related to increased
      (LPS+ATP)-induced IL-1beta production by PBMCs in our cohorts and was regulated
      by increased transcription of ILIB. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which
      the ATG16L1 CD-associated gene variant may predispose people to develop
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans in active and inactive Crohn's disease and
      healthy controls: a case-control study.
PG  - 1024-31
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the
      diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut
      microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of 
      this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with
      active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
      Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and
      healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake
      of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency
      questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with
      different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between
      intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken.
      RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median
      2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6
      g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower
      oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d,
      2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences 
      in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations
      between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and
      oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain
      score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho =
      -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume

TI  - Eosinophils and IL-33 Perpetuate Chronic Inflammation and Fibrosis in a Pediatric
      Population with Stricturing Crohn's Ileitis.
PG  - 2429-40
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibrostenosis and stricture are well-recognized endpoints in Crohn's 
      disease (CD). We hypothesized that stricturing CD is characterized by
      eosinophilia and epithelial IL-33. We proposed that eosinophil exposure to IL-33 
      would perpetuate inflammatory chronicity and subsequent fibrostenosis. METHODS:
      We performed a retrospective study of 74 children with inflammatory and
      stricturing ileal CD comparing clinicopathological features to
      immunohistochemical measures of eosinophilia and IL-33. To scrutinize eosinophil 
      patterns, we developed a novel eosinophil peroxidase score encompassing number,
      distribution, and degranulation. Human eosinophils and intestinal fibroblasts
      were cultured with IL-33 and IL-13, and inflammatory and remodeling parameters
      were assessed. Antieosinophil therapy was also administered to the Crohn's-like
      ileitis model (SAMP1/SkuSlc). RESULTS: Our novel eosinophil peroxidase score was 
      more sensitive than H&E staining, revealing significant differences in eosinophil
      patterns, comparing inflammatory and stricturing pediatric CD. A significant
      relationship between ileal eosinophilia and complicated
      clinical/histopathological phenotype including fibrosis was determined. IL-33
      induced significant eosinophil peroxidase secretion and IL-13 production.
      Exposure to eosinophils in the presence of IL-33, "primed" fibroblasts to
      increase proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6),
      eosinophil-associated chemokines (CCL24 and CCL26), and IL-13Ralpha2 production. 
      Production of fibrogenic molecules (collagen 1A2, fibronectin, and periostin)
      increased after exposure of "primed" fibroblasts to IL-13. Epithelial-IL-33 was
      increased in pediatric Crohn's ileitis and strongly associated with clinical and 
      histopathological activity, ileal eosinophilia, and complicated fibrostenotic
      disease. SAMP1/SkuSlc eosinophil-targeted treatment resulted in significant
      improvements in inflammation and remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of specimens 
      from pediatric patients with ileal CD linked eosinophil patterns and IL-33 to
      fibrosis and suggested that these may contribute to the perpetuation of
      inflammation and subsequent stricture in pediatric CD.

TI  - Assessment of Sex Differences for Treatment, Procedures, Complications, and
      Associated Conditions Among Adolescents Hospitalized with Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2619-24
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex differences among adults in healthcare treatment and outcomes
      have been reported; however, there is a paucity of literature regarding pediatric
      populations, particularly adolescents with Crohn's disease (CD). The objective
      was to identify whether sex differences exist with respect to complications,
      procedures, and medication usage (corticosteroids, biological agents, and total
      parenteral nutrition) among hospitalized adolescents with CD. METHODS:
      Adolescents with CD (n = 5782) hospitalized between April 1, 2004, and June 30,
      2012, were selected from the Pediatric Health Information System database with a 
      1:1 ratio of males to females by hospital. Frequency of disease complications,
      associated conditions, procedures performed, and medication usage were analyzed
      with nonparametric statistical tests for the existence of sex differences.
      RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred eighty-two patients were included with a
      median age of 15 years. Females were slightly more likely to have anemia (29%
      versus 25%, P = 0.012), infection (12% versus 8%, P = 0.001), and mood disorder
      (9% versus 6%, P < 0.001), whereas males had more maturational delays (3% versus 
      1%, P = 0.004) and malnutrition (18% versus 14%, P = 0.027). Among procedures,
      only one category demonstrated a sex difference: females had more blood product
      transfusions (9% versus 6%, P < 0.001). Female rates for corticosteroids (62%),
      biological agents (16%), and total parenteral nutritionTPN (18%) were not
      statistically different from those for males (62%, 15%, and 20%, respectively).
      There were no differences in length of stay by sex. CONCLUSIONS: This
      cross-sectional study of an administrative database identified few sex
      differences among adolescents with CD. The effect sizes were universally small
      and generally consistent with known sex differences unrelated to IBD.

TI  - CONSORT: Different End-Points of Preoperative Nutrition and Outcome of Bowel
      Resection of Crohn Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e1175
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001175 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional therapy cannot only improve nutritional status but also reduce bowel 
      inflammation in Crohn disease (CD). The benefits of preoperative nutritional
      therapy on outcomes of surgery for CD have been demonstrated. However, the ideal 
      end-points of preoperative nutrition in CD remain elusive. We conducted this
      study to figure out whether improvement of malnutrition or reduction of
      inflammation is the better end-point of preoperative nutrition for CD. This was a
      prospective, randomized study. All patients enrolled received preoperative
      nutrition with different end-points (improvement of malnutrition, IOM, or
      reduction of inflammation, ROI). The end-points were defined using serum albumin 
      and body weight gain, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively.
      Postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative
      recurrence of the disease were compared. A total of 108 patients were randomized 
      and 91 patients (44 in IOM group and 47 in ROI group) completed this study. It
      took 25.57 +/- 11.68 days to achieve ROI and 45.29 +/- 18.47 days for IOM (P =
      0.0023). After nutritional therapy, serum CRP, CDAI, and serum albumin in both
      groups improved significantly. But patients in the IOM group had a higher albumin
      level and body weight gain compared with ROI group (P = 0.0026, P < 0.0001). When
      comparing postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative
      recurrence, no significant differences were noted. Compared with IOM, ROI as the 
      end-point of preoperative nutrition had the same benefits on operative outcomes
      in CD patients undergoing resection, but could be achieved in a shorter time
      (NCT01540942).

TI  - Serum Proteome Profiles in Stricturing Crohn's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 1935-41
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease with
      different described behaviors, including stricture. At present, there are no
      laboratory studies that can differentiate stricturing CD from other phenotypes of
      inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a pilot study to examine differences in 
      the proteome among patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and
      ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were selected from the Ocean State
      Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry, an established cohort of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with CD with surgically resected stricture
      were matched with similar patients with CD without known stricture and with
      ulcerative colitis. Serum samples from each patient were digested and analyzed
      using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the proteome.
      Statistical analyses were performed to identify peptides and proteins that can
      differentiate CD with stricture. RESULTS: Samples from 9 patients in each group
      (27 total patients) were analyzed. Baseline demographic characteristics were
      similar among the 3 groups. We quantified 7668 peptides and 897 proteins for
      analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a subset of
      peptides with an area under the curve greater than 0.9, indicating greater
      separation potential. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was able to
      distinguish among the three groups with up to 70% accuracy by peptides and up to 
      80% accuracy by proteins. We identified the significantly different proteins and 
      peptides and determined their function based on previously published literature. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The serum of patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and
      ulcerative colitis is distinguishable through proteomic analysis. Some of the
      proteins that differentiate the stricturing phenotype have been implicated in
      complement activation, fibrinolytic pathways, and lymphocyte adhesion.

TI  - Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Air as Novel Marker for Disease Activity in
      Crohn's Disease: A Metabolomic Approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disappearance of macroscopic mucosal inflammation predicts long-term 
      outcome in Crohn's disease (CD). It can be assessed by ileocolonoscopy, which is,
      however, an invasive and expensive procedure. Disease activity indices do not
      correlate well with endoscopic activity and noninvasive markers have a low
      sensitivity in subgroups of patients. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath
      are of increasing interest as noninvasive markers. The aim of this study was to
      investigate whether VOCs can accurately differentiate between active CD and
      remission. METHODS: Patients participated in a 1-year follow-up study and
      Harvey-Bradshaw index, blood, fecal, and breath samples were collected at regular
      intervals. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: active (fecal calprotectin
      >250 microg/g) or inactive (Harvey-Bradshaw index <4, C-reactive protein <5 mg/L,
      and fecal calprotectin <100 microg/g) disease. Breath samples were analyzed by
      gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Random forest analyses were 
      used to find the most discriminatory VOCs. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five
      breath-o-grams were measured, 140 samples were assigned as active, 135 as
      inactive disease, and 110 samples of healthy controls. A set of 10 discriminatory
      VOCs correctly predicted active CD in 81.5% and remission in 86.4% (sensitivity
      0.81, specificity 0.80, AUC 0.80). These VOCs were combined into a single disease
      activity score that classified disease activity in more than 60% of the
      previously undetermined individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that VOCs can
      separate healthy controls and patients with active CD and CD in remission in a
      real-life cohort. Analysis of exhaled air is an interesting new noninvasive
      application for monitoring mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult and
      time-consuming. In recent years, diagnostic usefulness of fecal calprotectin has 
      been proven. However, data on the utility of other fecal markers are scarce.
      AIMS: To evaluate the usefulness of fecal lactoferrin (FL) in the assessment of
      CD activity. METHODS: The group consisted of 101 CD patients (median age: 30
      years, IQR: 24-37). FL was measured in a single stool sample by using the
      immunoenzymatic methods. The clinical activity of the disease was evaluated by
      using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Depending on the location of the
      disease, either a colonoscopy or magnetic resonance enterography was performed or
      both in order to evaluate the disease activity by using appropriate endoscopic
      and enterographic scores. RESULTS: Median FL concentration was 84.14 (IQR:
      36.4-302.9) mug/ml and it correlated with C-reactive protein concentration
      (p=0.0000001, r=0.5), CDAI (p=0.002, r=0.3) and colonic Simple Endoscopic Score
      for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) (p=0.000004, r=0.5). Assuming endoscopic remission
      in the large intestine with colonic SES-CD</=3 points, a ROC curve showed that FL
      concentration of 145.82 mug/ml had 84.6% sensitivity and 60.5% specificity in
      discriminating CD patients with endoscopically active and inactive disease [AUC: 
      0.676 (95% CI: 0.531-0.8), (p=0.0347)]. The positive predictive value for this
      concentration was 42% and negative predictive value -92%. CONCLUSIONS: FL is a
      sensitive marker of CD activity and it reliably reflects the mucosal inflammatory
      lesions in large intestine. Thus, it can be helpful in diagnostics and monitoring
      of CD.

      Are at Risk for Subsequent Hospitalization.
PG  - 2254-61
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000516 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported Crohn's disease (CD) symptoms and endoscopic
      evaluation have historically guided routine care, but the risk of complications
      in asymptomatic patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) is unknown.
      METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of patients with
      CD from a tertiary care center. Subjects with short inflammatory bowel disease
      questionnaire scores >/= 50, Harvey-Bradshaw CD scores </= 4, and same-day CRP
      measurement were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was disease-related 
      hospitalization up to 24 months after the qualifying clinic visit. We assessed
      the relationship between CRP elevation and subsequent hospitalization. RESULTS:
      There were 351 asymptomatic patients with CD (median age 40 yr; 50.4% female) who
      met inclusion criteria, and CRP was elevated in 19.7% of these individuals (n =
      69). At 24 months, 16.8% (n = 59) of the study population had been hospitalized
      for CD-related complications. Significantly, more patients with an elevated CRP
      were hospitalized (33.3% versus 12.8%, P < 0.0001) compared with those with a
      normal CRP and were hospitalized at increased rate (P < 0.001) on Kaplan-Meier
      analysis. CRP elevation was significantly and independently associated with
      increased risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 2.12; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.13-3.98; P = 0.02) in multivariable survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Asymptomatic patients with CD with elevated CRP are at a nearly 2-fold higher
      risk for hospitalization over the subsequent 2 years compared with asymptomatic
      patients with CD without CRP elevation.

TI  - Health Insurance Paid Costs and Drivers of Costs for Patients With Crohn's
      Disease in the United States.
PG  - 15-23
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2015.207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cost of medical care for Crohn's disease (CD) and comorbidities
      in the era of biologics is unclear. We examined insurance claims data from US
      health plans to understand this relationship. METHODS: Longitudinal CD patient
      data and reimbursement information from 11 health plans engaged with Accordant
      Health Services between 2011 and 2013 were analyzed. The analysis considered data
      for all CD patients and for the patient subgroup </=20 years and >20 years of
      age. Descriptive statistics measured the mean health-plan paid costs per patient,
      the relative cost contribution of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and
      health care costs for 31 specific comorbid conditions among CD patients. RESULTS:
      Overall, there were 5,090 CD patients (57% women) of which 587 CD patients were
      </=20 years of age. The mean health-plan paid cost per member per year was
      $18,637 (s.d. $32,023) for all CD patients, $22,796 (s.d. $ 41,905) for CD
      patients </=20 years, and $18,095 (s.d. $30,065) for patients >20 years of age.
      Twenty-eight percent of CD patients accounted for 80% of total costs. No
      differences were found in costs based on gender. Increased health-plan paid costs
      were significantly correlated with the number of comorbid conditions across all
      ages. Pharmacy utilization costs account for nearly one-half (45.5%) of the total
      CD-attributable costs, exceeding inpatient care costs. Anti-TNF agents alone
      comprised nearly one-third (29.5%) of total costs. Aside from anti-TNF costs,
      other major categories of expense were as follows: inpatient 23.1%, outpatient
      hospital setting 15.7%, and MD office 8.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Total health-care costs 
      in CD exceed previous estimates, with the majority of costs being allocated to a 
      relatively small subgroup of patients. Pharmacy utilization costs, owing to
      anti-TNF use, result in increasing total health-care costs and currently exceed
      costs for inpatient care. Pragmatic strategies to encourage gastroenterologists
      in the best clinical practice of optimizing anti-TNF use-in particular for
      younger age patients and those with multiple comorbidities-are necessary to
      reduce avoidable pharmacy utilization and inpatient care costs.

PG  - 2383-92
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the major forms 
      of inflammatory bowel disease, and pathogenesis involves a complex interplay
      among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. We evaluated isoform
      expression of the IL-12-activated transcription factor STAT4 in children with CD 
      and UC. METHODS: We collected biopsy samples from both patients newly diagnosed
      with CD and with UC. We further collected blood samples from patients newly
      diagnosed with CD and with UC as well as from patients who had a flare-up after
      being in clinical remission, and we examined the ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha
      mRNA. In addition to STAT4 isoforms, we measured the expression of the cytokines 
      TNFalpha, IFNgamma, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and IL-17
      using polymerase chain reaction of biopsy samples and multiplex analysis of
      patient serum samples. RESULTS: Ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha were increased in 
      specific gastrointestinal tract segments in both patients with CD and those with 
      UC that correlate with the location and severity of inflammation. In contrast, we
      did not observe changes in STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in biopsy specimens from
      patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. We also observed increased
      STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients
      with UC and those with CD, compared with healthy controls. Ratios were normalized
      after patients were treated with steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data 
      indicate that STAT4 isoforms could be an important noninvasive biomarker in the
      diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and that expression of
      these isoforms might provide further insight into the pathogenesis of IBD.

AB  - Awareness of the extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn disease is increasing in
      dermatology and gastroenterology, with enhanced identification of entities that
      range from granulomatous diseases recapitulating the underlying inflammatory
      bowel disease to reactive conditions and associated dermatoses. In this review,
      the underlying etiopathology of Crohn disease is discussed, and how this mirrors 
      certain skin manifestations that present in a subset of patients is explored. The
      array of extraintestinal manifestations that do not share a similar pathology,
      but which are often seen in association with inflammatory bowel disease, is also 
      discussed. Treatment and pathogenetic mechanisms, where available, are discussed.

TI  - Impact of Crohn's Disease on Marital Quality of Life: A Preliminary
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 873-80
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Quality of marriage exerts a great effect on quality of life
      [QOL] and health outcomes. Few data are available on the effects of Crohn's
      disease [CD] on quality of marriage. We aimed to clarify whether and how CD
      affected the marital relationship. METHODS: Web-based questionnaires were created
      including an ENRICH marital inventory, a general QOL survey [SF12], a short
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [SIBDQ] and a modified Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index [HBI]. Married patients were enrolled through the outpatient registration
      system and diverse social media websites. Controls were subsequently enrolled and
      matched with the ratio of 1:1 through invitation emails and internet advertising.
      RESULTS: A total of 243 patients completed valid questionnaires and then 243
      matched individuals were enrolled. Male patients were more affected, representing
      a significantly reduced total marital score. CD impaired the dimensions of
      idealistic distortion and marital satisfaction in both genders. There were
      correlations between quality of marriage, SF12, SIBDQ and HBI. Mental scale of
      SF12 correlated best with the marital relationship, indicating more significant
      involvement of mental adjustment. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that
      spouse's educational background, duration of marriage from disease onset, enteral
      nutrition, hospitalisation in past 12 months, and number of previous
      hospitalisations, independently impacted on quality of marriage. CONCLUSIONS:
      Certain aspects of the marital relationship were impaired in CD patients,
      especially in male subjects. In addition to medication, mental interventions
      should be given attention to improve the marriage of CD patients. Despite some
      novel findings in this study, this research orientation deserves more attention.

TI  - Dietary Fiber Intake is Associated with Increased Colonic Mucosal GPR43+
      Polymorphonuclear Infiltration in Active Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 5327-46
LID - 10.3390/nu7075223 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor 43/free fatty acid receptor 2 (GPR43/FFAR2) is
      essential for polymorphonuclear (PMN) recruitment. We investigated the expression
      of GPR43/FFAR2 in the colon from Crohn's disease patients and whether dietary
      fiber in enteral nutrition increases GPR43+ polymorphonuclear infiltration in
      mucosa. Segments of ascending colon and white blood cells from peripheral blood
      were obtained from 46 Crohn's disease patients and 10 colon cancer patients. The 
      Crohn's disease patients were grouped by the activity of disease (active or
      remission) and enteral nutrition with or without dietary fiber. Histological
      feature, expression and location of GPR43/FFAR2 and level of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase were
      assessed. The results of hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining
      revealed that the infiltration of immune cells, including GPR43+ PMN, was more
      severe in active Crohn's disease patients who consumed normal food or enteral
      nutrition with dietary fiber than in remission patients and colon cancer
      patients. This finding was supported by the results of GPR43 and myeloperoxidase 
      expression. Active Crohn's disease (CD) patients who consumed enteral nutrition
      without dietary fiber exhibited severe immune cell infiltration similar to the
      other active CD patients, but GPR43+ PMNs were rarely observed. The level of
      TNF-alpha mRNA in active Crohn's disease patients was higher than those of the
      other patients. In conclusion, the use of dietary fiber in enteral nutrition by
      active Crohn's disease patients might increase GPR43+ PMNs infiltration in colon 
      mucosa. This effect was not observed in Crohn's disease patients in remission.

TI  - Lamina propria macrophage phenotypes in relation to Escherichia coli in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0305-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal handling of E. coli by lamina propria (LP) macrophages may
      contribute to Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. We aimed to determine LP
      macrophage phenotypes in CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls (HC),
      and in CD, to compare macrophage phenotypes according to E. coli carriage.
      METHODS: Mucosal biopsies were taken from 35 patients with CD, 9 with UC and 18
      HCs. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate E. coli-laden and unladen 
      LP macrophages from ileal or colonic biopsies. From these macrophages, mRNA was
      extracted and cytokine and activation marker expression measured using RT-qPCR.
      RESULTS: E. coli-laden LP macrophages were identified commonly in mucosal
      biopsies from CD patients (25/35, 71 %), rarely in UC (1/9, 11 %) and not at all 
      in healthy controls (0/18). LP macrophage cytokine mRNA expression was greater in
      CD and UC than healthy controls. In CD, E. coli-laden macrophages expressed high 
      IL-10 & CD163 and lower TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS irrespective of macroscopic
      inflammation. In inflamed tissue, E. coli-unladen macrophages expressed high
      TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS and lower IL-10 & CD163. In uninflamed tissue, unladen
      macrophages had low cytokine mRNA expression, closer to that of healthy controls.
      CONCLUSION: In CD, intra-macrophage E. coli are commonly found and LP macrophages
      express characteristic cytokine mRNA profiles according to E. coli carriage.
      Persistence of E. coli within LP macrophages may provide a stimulus for chronic
      inflammation.

TI  - Severe scurvy: an underestimated disease.
PG  - 1076-7
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.99 [doi]
AB  - Scurvy is one of the oldest diseases in human history. Nowadays, although scurvy 
      tends to become a forgotten disease in developed country, rare cases still occur,
      especially in people undergoing extreme diet, old people or children with poor
      diet and patients with malabsorption. We describe three cases of scurvy. The
      first case is a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease, the second one is in a
      context of anorexia nervosa and drug addiction, and the third case is in a
      context of social isolation. Early recognition of scurvy can be difficult because
      symptoms may appear nonspecific and can mimic more common conditions. In any
      patient with spontaneous hematoma and purpura, in the context of nutritional
      disorder, scurvy should be systematically considered. As this disease can lead to
      severe complications, such as bone pain, heart failure or gastrointestinal
      symptoms, nothing should delay vitamin C supplementation, which is a simple and
      rapidly effective treatment.

TI  - Macrophage and dendritic cell subsets in IBD: ALDH+ cells are reduced in colon
      tissue of patients with ulcerative colitis regardless of inflammation.
PG  - 171-82
LID - 10.1038/mi.2015.48 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and
      macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized 
      DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in
      clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites.
      Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total
      CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including 
      CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In 
      MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and
      CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC,
      particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. 
      The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
      activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease
      and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In
      contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors 
      was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that
      ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether
      the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal
      environment.

PG  - 6809-16
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i22.6809 [doi]
AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition involves the use of a complete liquid diet, with the 
      exclusion of normal dietary components for a defined period of time, as a
      therapeutic measure to induce remission in active Crohn's disease (CD). This very
      efficacious approach leads to high rates of remission, especially in children and
      adolescents newly diagnosed with CD. This intervention also results in mucosal
      healing, nutritional improvements and enhanced bone health. Whilst several recent
      studies have provided further elaboration of the roles of exclusive enteral
      nutrition in the management of CD, other reports have provided new understanding 
      of the mechanisms by which this intervention acts.

TI  - Toward enteral nutrition for the treatment of pediatric Crohn disease in Canada: 
      a workshop to identify barriers and enablers.
PG  - 351-6
LID - 16819 [pii]
AB  - The treatment armamentarium in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) is very similar to
      adult-onset CD with the notable exception of the use of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN [the administration of a liquid formula diet while excluding
      normal diet]), which is used more frequently by pediatric gastroenterologists to 
      induce remission. In pediatric CD, EEN is now recommended by the pediatric
      committee of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition as a
      first-choice agent to induce remission, with remission rates in pediatric studies
      consistently >75%. To chart and address enablers and barriers of use of EEN in
      Canada, a workshop was held in September 2014 in Toronto (Ontario), inviting
      pediatric gastroenterologists, nurses and dietitians from most Canadian pediatric
      IBD centres as well as international faculty from the United States and Europe
      with particular research and clinical expertise in the dietary management of
      pediatric CD. Workshop participants ranked the exclusivity of enteral nutrition; 
      the health care resources; and cost implications as the top three barriers to its
      use. Conversely, key enablers mentioned included: standardization and sharing of 
      protocols for use of enteral nutrition; ensuring sufficient dietetic resources;
      and reducing the cost of EEN to the family (including advocacy for reimbursement 
      by provincial ministries of health and private insurance companies). Herein, the 
      authors report on the discussions during this workshop and list strategies to
      enhance the use of EEN as a treatment option in the treatment of pediatric CD in 
      Canada.

      subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor antibody.
PG  - 6613-20
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i21.6613 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To study whether adalimumab (ADA) was associated with improvement in growth,
      bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism. METHODS: In children with Crohn's
      disease (CD) there is a high prevalence of growth failure and reduced BMD.
      Treatment with infliximab is associated with an improvement in growth.
      Anthropometry, paediatric CD activity index (PCDAI), bone markers and BMD was
      measured in 18 patients (72% females) one year before and after start of ADA with
      a median age of 14.4 years (range: 5-19 years) at treatment start. Outcomes were 
      indicators of growth with treatment as well as interval growth. RESULTS: Eleven
      (61%) children experienced catch-up growth after ADA. PCDAI significantly
      decreased from 52.1 +/- 16 to 30.4 +/- 23 (P </= 0.001). Post ADA, body mass
      index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) 0.1[range: 2.7-(-0.8)] vs -1 [range:
      0.1-(-3.6)], P = 0.04 and BMI SDS in children 0.3 [range: 0.7-(-0.2)] vs -1.1
      [range: 1.2-(-2.3)], P = 0.01 in remission were significantly higher compared to 
      those with moderate to severe inflammation. The main predictors for growth were
      25-hydroxycholecalciferol and for bone mineralisation weight and height SDS. ADA 
      had no significant influence on bone markers and BMD. CONCLUSION: Next to
      improvement of PCDAI, half of the children achieved a positive catch-up growth. A
      better nutritional status with improvement in BMI and weight is positive
      predictor for improved growth and bone mineralisation.

TI  - Identification of a common variant with potential pleiotropic effect on risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
PG  - 999-1007

AB  - Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have separately identified many
      genetic susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and
      colorectal cancer (CRC), there has been no large-scale examination for
      pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, for these conditions. We used
      logistic regression modeling to examine the associations of 181 UC and CD
      susceptibility variants previously identified by GWAS with risk of CRC using data
      from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon 
      Cancer Family Registry. We also examined associations of significant variants
      with clinical and molecular characteristics in a subset of the studies. Among
      11794 CRC cases and 14190 controls, rs11676348, the susceptibility single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for UC, was significantly associated with reduced
      risk of CRC (P = 7E-05). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of CRC with each
      copy of the T allele was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.96). The association of the SNP with
      risk of CRC differed according to mucinous histological features (P heterogeneity
      = 0.008). In addition, the (T) allele was associated with lower risk of tumors
      with Crohn's-like reaction but not tumors without such immune infiltrate (P
      heterogeneity = 0.02) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) but not
      microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors (P heterogeneity = 0.03). The minor
      allele (T) in SNP rs11676348, located downstream from CXCR2 that has been
      implicated in CRC progression, is associated with a lower risk of CRC,
      particularly tumors with a mucinous component, Crohn's-like reaction and
      MSI-high. Our findings offer the promise of risk stratification of inflammatory
      bowel disease patients for complications such as CRC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4
      (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have 
      been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are
      inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the
      relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014
      were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR)
      and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. 
      RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a
      significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD
      susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962,
      P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association
      was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall,
      Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant
      association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall
      population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT,
      OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937,
      P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038;
      GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95%
      CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in
      Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049).
      CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism 
      is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these 
      findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive
      conclusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between
      25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) and markers of vitamin D status in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 
      59 pediatric patients with IBD (age 16.4 +/- 2.2 y) and 116 controls (age 14.6
      +/- 4.4 y), to investigate the association between 25(OH)D and albuminemia for
      protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and hepatic dysfunction; alanine transaminase
      (ALT) for hepatic inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for
      intestinal inflammation; body mass index (BMI) for adiposity; seasons and skin
      pigmentation for insolation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D < 50
      nmol/L; abnormal liver enzyme by ALT >40 U/L; overweight status by BMI of >/=85th
      but <95th percentile, and obesity by BMI >/=95th percentile. Seasons were
      categorized as summer, winter, spring, and fall. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had a
      higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42.4% versus 26.7%; P = 0.04),
      elevated ALT (16.9% versus 2.6%; P < 0.001), and lower albumin (41.1 +/- 4.8
      versus 45.1 +/- 3.8; P < 0.001) than controls. In both the IBD cohort and
      controls, 25(OH)D was highest in summer and lowest in winter, and significantly
      higher in white than in non-white patients. ESR varied significantly with 25(OH)D
      (R(2) = 0.24; beta = -0.32; P = 0.010), and only patients with IBD with elevated 
      ESR had lower 25(OH)D than controls (49.5 +/- 25.2 versus 65.3 +/- 28.0 nmol/L; P
      = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation, not the loss of albumin-bound
      vitamin D in the gut, is the primary intestinal determinant of vitamin D status
      in IBD. The extraintestinal determinants are seasons and skin pigmentation, but
      not adiposity and hepatic inflammation.

TI  - The influence of anti-TNF therapy on the magnetic resonance enterographic
      parameters of Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 2210-8

AB  - PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a useful tool in assessing the 
      transmural and extraintestinal lesions in Crohn's disease (CD). However, the
      influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on MRE features of CD 
      severity remains unknown. The purpose of the study was to assess the short- and
      long-term changes in MRE features of CD activity in relation to CD clinical
      course in patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies. METHODS: The influence on
      the most important parameters of CD activity seen in MRE was assessed
      retrospectively using a validated score. Patients were treated with anti-TNF
      agents and the clinical, laboratory, and MRE CD activity was estimated at
      baseline, after the induction therapy and after 1 year of treatment. RESULTS: 71 
      patients were enrolled in a study. The change in CD clinical activity correlated 
      significantly with fluctuations in MRE activity score (P < 0.0001, r = 0.5 for
      induction; P = 0.004, r = 0.7 for maintenance anti-TNF therapy, respectively).
      Bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular
      proliferation were MRE parameters which changed significantly both after the
      induction and maintenance treatment in patients responding to the therapy. The
      change in MRE activity score was mostly pronounced during the first 3 months of
      treatment, when compared to the continuation of the therapy till week 52-54 (-6
      points vs. -2 points, respectively; P = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: Transmural and
      extraintestinal healing seen in MRE correlates with changes in CD clinical
      activity during anti-TNF therapy, thus MRE seems to be a useful tool in
      monitoring the efficacy of biological agents.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

TI  - Systematic review: Body composition in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 142-57
LID - 10.1111/apt.13218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with weight
      loss, growth restriction and malnutrition. Bone mass deficits are well described,
      little is known about other body composition compartments. AIMS: To define the
      alterations in non-bone tissue compartments in children with IBD, and explore the
      effects of demographic and disease parameters. METHODS: A systematic search was
      carried out in the PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Web of Science
      databases in May 2014 (limitations age <17 years, and composition measurements
      compared with a defined control population). RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were
      included in this systematic review, reporting on a total of 1479 children with
      IBD [1123 Crohn's disease, 243 ulcerative colitis], pooled mean age 13.1 +/- 3.2 
      years, and 34.9% female. Data were highly heterogeneous, in terms of methodology 
      and patients. Deficits in protein-related compartments were reported. Lean mass
      deficits were documented in 93.6% of Crohn's disease and 47.7% of ulcerative
      colitis patients when compared with healthy control populations. Lower lean mass 
      was common to both sexes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, deficits in
      females with persisted for longer. Fat-related compartment findings were
      inconsistent, some studies report reductions in body fat in new diagnosis/active 
      Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that almost all children with Crohn's
      disease and half with ulcerative colitis have reduced lean mass, however, body
      fat alterations are not well defined. To understand what impact this may have on 
      health and disease in children with IBD, further studies are needed to identify
      in which tissues these deficits lie, and to quantify body fat and its
      distribution.

TI  - Two-Year Outcomes After Exclusive Enteral Nutrition Induction Are Superior to
      Corticosteroids in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Treated Early with Thiopurines.
PG  - 3069-74
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3722-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impact of first-line induction therapy on medium-term outcomes in the
      setting of early thiopurine (TP) use in children with Crohn's disease has not
      been evaluated, in particular whether choice of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      over corticosteroids (CS) for induction impacts clinical outcomes at 12 and 24
      months. AIMS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 89 children from our
      database with new diagnosis CD and follow-up of at least 2 years following
      induction with exclusive course of CS or EEN and early, dose-optimized TP (within
      6 months from diagnosis) were evaluated. We compared steroid dependency (relapse 
      <3 months of tapering first course CS or inability to wean <10 mg prednisolone), 
      need for IFX, linear growth, and surgical resections over the first 2 years.
      RESULTS: Choice of EEN over CS induction was associated with reduced linear
      growth failure (7 vs. 26%, p = 0.02), CS dependency (7 vs. 43%, p = 0.002), and
      improved primary sustained response to IFX (86 vs. 68%, p = 0.02). Combined
      CS/IFX-free remission and surgical resection rates were similar. CONCLUSION: In
      the setting of early TP commencement, EEN induction is superior to CS induction
      for reducing growth failure, CS dependency, and loss of response to IFX over the 
      first 2 years.

TI  - Belgian multicenter experience with intestinal transplantation.
PG  - 1362-70
LID - 10.1111/tri.12615 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal transplantation (ITx) has evolved from an experimental procedure
      toward a clinical reality but remains a challenging procedure. The aim of this
      survey was to analyze the multicenter Belgian ITx experience. From 1999 to 2014, 
      24 ITx in 23 patients were performed in Belgium, divided over five centers.
      Median recipient age was 38 years (8 months-57 years); male/female ratio was
      13/10; six were children; and 17 adults. Intestinal failure was related to
      intestinal ischemia (n = 5), volvulus (n = 5), splanchnic thrombosis (n = 4),
      Crohn (n = 2), pseudo-obstruction (n = 2), microvillus inclusion (n = 2),
      Churg-Strauss (n = 1), necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 1), intestinal atresia (n =
      1), and chronic rejection (n = 1). Graft type was isolated ITx (n = 9), combined 
      liver-ITx (n = 11) and multivisceralTx (n = 4). One was a living donor-related
      transplantation and five patients received simultaneously a kidney graft. Early
      acute rejection occurred in 8; late acute rejection in 4; and chronic rejection
      in 2. Two patients developed a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Nine 
      patients have died. Among 14 survivors at last follow-up, 11 have been
      transplanted for more than 1 year. None of the latter has developed renal
      failure, and all were nutritionally independent with a Karnofsky score > 90%.
      One-/five-year patient and graft survivals were 71.1%, 62.8%, 58.7% and 53.1%,
      respectively. Based on this experience, ITx has come of age in Belgium as a
      lifesaving and potentially quality of life restoring therapy.

      and diseased subjects.
PG  - e0126685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126685 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale cohort studies are currently being designed to investigate the human 
      microbiome in health and disease. Adequate sampling strategies are required to
      limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage.
      Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on
      the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects.
      Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8
      inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately
      after defecation and stored at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C for 1 week, at +4
      degrees C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab,
      Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used
      pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial
      communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80
      degrees C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate 
      analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p < 0.001) but not by
      storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a
      significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80 degrees C versus the
      other methods and -80 degrees C samples (p < 0.009). The relative abundance of
      Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods
      versus -80 degrees C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p < 0.05). Storage up to 24 
      hours (at +4 degrees C or room temperature) or freezing at -20 degrees C did not 
      significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct
      freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal
      disorders.

TI  - Clinical applications of bioactive milk components.
PG  - 463-76
AB  - Milk represents a unique resource for translational medicine: It contains a rich 
      pool of biologically active molecules with demonstrated clinical benefits. The
      ongoing characterization of the mechanistic process through which milk components
      promote development and immunity has revealed numerous milk-derived compounds
      with potential applications as clinical therapies in infectious and inflammatory 
      disease, cancer, and other conditions. Lactoferrin is an effective antimicrobial 
      and antiviral agent in high-risk patient populations and a potentially potent
      adjuvant to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Enteric nutrition formulas supplemented 
      with transforming growth factor beta, a milk cytokine, have been shown to promote
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. A number of milk glycans, including human
      milk oligosaccharides, show promise in preclinical studies as antimicrobial and
      anti-inflammatory agents. While active preclinical investigations of human milk
      may soon result in large-scale production of human milk molecules, bovine milk
      components in many instances represent a practical source of bioactive milk
      compounds for use in clinical trials. This review summarizes current efforts to
      translate the compounds derived from human and bovine milk into effective
      clinical therapies. These efforts suggest a common pathway for the translation of
      milk-derived compounds into clinical applications.

AB  - OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed on apical membranes of small intestine, and is
      involved in gastrointestinal absorption of its substrates, including the
      food-derived antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO). ERGO concentration in circulating 
      blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) is lower than
      that in healthy volunteers; thus, circulating ERGO is a potential diagnostic
      marker, although the mechanisms underlying low ERGO concentration in patients are
      unknown. Here, we focused on intestinal macrophages, which infiltrate sites of
      inflammation, and examined possible first-pass uptake of ERGO by macrophages.
      ERGO concentration in blood was lower in mice with dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis than in controls. On the other hand, expression of octn1
      gene product and ERGO concentration in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated mice
      were higher than in controls. Interestingly, lamina propria mononuclear cells
      (LPMCs) isolated from DSS-treated mice contained ERGO and showed [(3)H]ERGO
      uptake and Octn1 expression, whereas ERGO was undetectable in LPMCs of control
      mice. Functional expression of OCTN1 was also confirmed in LPS-stimulated human
      macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. In conclusion, OCTN1 is functionally expressed 
      on activated intestinal macrophages, and ERGO uptake into these immune cells
      could contribute at least in part to the altered disposition of ERGO in
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of adalimumab after infliximab failure in pediatric Crohn
      disease.
PG  - 744-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000713 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness 
      and safety of adalimumab (ADA) in children with Crohn disease (CD) who
      experienced infliximab (IFX) failure at the population level. METHODS: The
      present retrospective study included all of the children with CD from a
      pediatric-onset population-based cohort who received ADA before 18 years because 
      of IFX failure or intolerance. Efficacy of ADA was evaluated using the
      physician's global assessment score, C-reactive protein and orosomucoid, and
      nutritional and growth indicators. RESULTS: A total of 27 children with CD
      received ADA. Median age at CD diagnosis and at ADA initiation was 11 years (Q1 =
      9; Q3 = 12) and 15 years (12; 15), respectively. After a median follow-up of 16
      (8; 26) months after ADA initiation, ADA had clinical benefit as measured by the 
      physical global assessment score in 19 patients (70%). Cumulative probability of 
      failure to ADA treatment was 38% at 6 months and 55% at 1 year. Eight patients
      had a primary failure (30%) and 5 of 19 (26%) a secondary failure to ADA.
      Furthermore, 11 patients (40%) experienced a total of 19 adverse effects. No
      serious adverse effects were observed and none resulted in ADA discontinuation.
      There was no significant change in growth and nutritional patterns during the
      study period, but we found a significant decrease in median C-reactive protein
      (15 mg/L [4; 44] vs 9 mg/L [3; 19]; P = 0.05) and orosomucoid (1.6 g/L [1.5; 2.6]
      vs 1.1 g/L [0.8; 1.9]; P = 0.001) from ADA initiation to maximal follow-up in
      patients responding to ADA. CONCLUSIONS: In the present population-based cohort
      of pediatric-onset CD with IFX failure, treatment with ADA was safe and effective
      in two-thirds of patients.

PG  - 10223
LID - 10.1038/srep10223 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the role of magnetic resonance enterography
      (MRE) in predicting one-year efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor
      antibodies--infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA) in Crohn's disease (CD) patients
      primarily responding to therapy. We performed retrospective analysis among 61 CD 
      patients who had undergone a successful IFX/ADA induction therapy and were
      treated with maintenance doses. All patients underwent MRE at week 0. We assessed
      which MRE features were predictive for steroid-free remission at week 52, and
      which were associated with a secondary loss of response. 44 patients were in
      steroid-free remission at week 52, 17--were secondary non-responders. The ROC
      curve showed that bowel thickening with contrast enhancement analyzed together at
      week 0 were associated with steroid-free remission at week 52 (p = 0.01; AUC
      0.67). Bowel stenosis with or without prestenotic dilatation [OR 5.8 (95% CI
      1.4-25) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 - 5) respectively; p = 0.01] and the presence of
      intra-abdominal fistulas [OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-2); p=0.004] were related to
      secondary non-response. A high baseline inflammatory activity detected by MRE
      predicts one-year response in CD after IFX/ADA. In case of bowel stenosis,
      intra-abdominal fistulas, other therapeutic options should be considered.

TI  - Briakinumab for treatment of Crohn's disease: results of a randomized trial.
PG  - 1329-40
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000366 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of briakinumab, a human
      anti-IL-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody, compared with placebo for the induction and
      maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: In this phase 2b, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group
      study, 246 patients stratified by prior tumor necrosis factor-antagonist use and 
      response, were randomized (1:1:1:3) to 4 intravenous induction regimens: placebo,
      200, 400, or 700 mg briakinumab, at weeks 0/4/8. At week 12, responders in the
      placebo or 400-mg induction groups entered the maintenance phase with the same
      regimen, whereas responders in the 700-mg induction group were rerandomized
      (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 200, or 700 mg briakinumab at weeks 12/16/20. At week
      24, patients in remission stopped receiving study drug (withdrawal phase) until
      relapse. Patients experiencing relapse, nonresponders, and nonremitters could
      enter the open-label phase. RESULTS: The primary end point of clinical remission 
      at week 6 was not met. There were numerically greater rates of remission and
      response at 6, 12, or 24 weeks in patients treated with briakinumab. The safety
      and tolerability profile of briakinumab was similar in the induction and
      maintenance phases of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Briakinumab showed a similar safety
      and tolerability profile to placebo in the induction and maintenance phases, and 
      comparable rates of serious adverse events, adverse events leading to
      discontinuation, and malignancy. These data provide support for the potential
      efficacy of briakinumab and other IL-12/23 inhibitors in the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.

TI  - Use of Endoscopic Ultrasound to Guide Adalimumab Treatment in Perianal Crohn's
      Disease Results in Faster Fistula Healing.
PG  - 1594-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perianal disease is a manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) that has 
      poor long-term treatment outcomes. The aim was to determine if rectal endoscopic 
      ultrasound (EUS)-guided therapy with adalimumab (ADA) can improve outcomes for
      patients with perianal fistulizing CD. METHODS: This is a randomized prospective 
      study comparing serial EUS guidance of fistula treatment versus standard of care 
      in fistulizing perianal CD. At enrollment, all patients underwent a rectal EUS
      and an EUA with seton placement and/or I&D. Treatment was maximized with
      immunomodulators, antibiotics, and ADA induction. Surgical interventions were
      determined by the surgeon's discretion in the control group and assisted by every
      12th week EUS in the intervention group. Primary and secondary endpoints where
      complete drainage cessation at week 48 was fistula status per EUS, respectively. 
      RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled: 11 control and 9 EUS guidance. At 24
      weeks, 7/9 (78%) in EUS group and 3/11 (27%) in control group had drainage
      cessation (P = 0.04). This significant difference was lost at week 48 (P = 0.44).
      Three patients in the EUS and 1 in the control group had additional surgical
      intervention. Those in the EUS group had more rapid escalation of ADA dosing (P =
      0.003). There was no difference in the change in PDAI at week 48 versus baseline 
      (P = 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Rectal EUS-guided ADA therapy for CD perianal fistulas
      showed an initial benefit at 24 weeks, which was lost at week 48. This is likely 
      due to small sample size and higher fistula closure in the controls. However, the
      faster rate of fistula resolution is a clinically significant finding.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Nutritional and Biological Therapy in North American
      Children with Active Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1786-93
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic targets in pediatric Crohn's disease include symptoms,
      quality of life (QOL), and mucosal healing. Although partial enteral nutrition
      (PEN), exclusive enteral nutritional (EEN), and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha 
      (anti-TNF) therapy all improve symptoms, the comparative effectiveness of these
      approaches to improve QOL and achieve mucosal healing has not been assessed
      prospectively. METHODS: In a prospective study of children initiating PEN, EEN,
      or anti-TNF therapy for Crohn's disease, we compared clinical outcomes using the 
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), QOL (IMPACT score), and mucosal
      healing as estimated by fecal calprotectin (FCP). PCDAI, IMPACT, FCP, and diet
      (prompted 24-h recall) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy.
      RESULTS: We enrolled 90 children with active Crohn's disease (PCDAI, 33.7 +/-
      13.7; and FCP, 976 +/- 754), of whom 52 were treated with anti-TNF, 22 with EEN, 
      and 16 with PEN plus ad lib diet. Clinical response (PCDAI reduction >/=15 or
      final PCDAI </=10) was achieved by 64% on PEN, 88% EEN, and 84% anti-TNF (test
      for trend P = 0.08). FCP </=250 mug/g was achieved with PEN in 14%, EEN 45%, and 
      anti-TNF 62% (test for trend P = 0.001). Improvement in overall QOL was not
      statistically significantly different between the 3 groups (P = 0.86). However,
      QOL improvement was the greatest with EEN in the body image (P = 0.03) domain and
      with anti-TNF in the emotional domain (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although PEN
      improved clinical symptoms, EEN and anti-TNF were more effective for decreasing
      mucosal inflammation and improving specific aspects of QOL.

TI  - Successful Mercaptopurine Usage despite Azathioprine-Induced Pancreatitis in
      Paediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 676-9
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine [AZA] and mercaptopurine [MP] are recommended for
      maintenance of steroid-free remission in children with Crohn`s disease [CD].
      Azathioprine-induced pancreatitis, an idiosyncratic and major side effect, has
      been considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of a second
      thiopurine in IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe two children with 
      CD in whom MP were successfully trialled after a confirmed azathioprine-induced
      pancreatitis, being well tolerated in both cases. RESULTS: Two boys [13 and 10
      years old] started exclusive enteral nutrition after diagnosis of moderate
      (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [wPCDAI] = 45) and mild [wPCDAI = 35]
      CD. Both developed an acute mild to moderate pancreatitis after 2 and 3 weeks,
      respectively, of AZA treatment but recovered fully in hospital after AZA
      withdrawal. They started on MP treatment without any adverse effect. They were
      tested for the presence of polymorphisms 238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G in the TPMT
      gene and 94C>A and 21>C in the ITPase. Both patients were wild-type for all
      tested polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine-induced acute pancreatitis should
      not be considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of MP. Further
      investigation is required to create a better understanding of the mechanism
      underlying the adverse events and to allow more possibilities for personalised
      therapy.

PG  - 951-5
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000386 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) the incidence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), (b) whether and how the occurrence and
      severity of RLS is related to severity of CD, and (c) how RLS influences the
      quality of life of CD patients. BASIC METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional
      questionnaire study in a random selection of 144 CD patients and 80 controls.
      Differences were calculated using a chi-test (categorical data), an independent
      T-test (continuous data, normal distribution), or a Mann-Whitney U-test
      (continuous data, non-normal distribution). Logistic regression analysis was
      carried out to establish the relation between CD and RLS after adjusting for risk
      factors. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of RLS was 25.7% (37/144) in CD patients
      compared with 12.5% (10/80) in the control group (P=0.02). CD patients using
      caffeine and patients with arthralgias had a higher risk for RLS. A higher score 
      on the modified Harvey Bradshaw Index and CD-related surgery were also associated
      with a higher risk for RLS. CD-related surgery was also associated with a more
      severe course of RLS. Patients and controls with RLS had a lower score on
      'physical functioning', one of the subcategories of the RAND-36 quality-of-life
      questionnaire. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION: RLS occurs more frequently in patients with 
      CD compared with healthy individuals. A more severe course of CD seems to be
      associated with a higher risk for RLS. The presence of RLS has a negative
      influence on quality of life, mainly interfering with physical activities of
      daily life.

TI  - School Attendance in Children With Functional Abdominal Pain and Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases.
PG  - 553-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000850 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional abdominal pain (FAP)
      are associated with debilitating symptoms and frequent medical visits that may
      disrupt school functioning. The aim of this study was to assess school-related
      quality of life and school absenteeism in children with IBD, compared with FAP
      and healthy controls. METHODS: School absenteeism and participation in school and
      after-school activities data were obtained for 43 children with Crohn disease
      (CD), 31 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 children with FAP, and 30
      age-matched healthy controls for the 2013-2014 school year. We used a
      semistructured questionnaire for both children and parents. For diminishing
      recall bias, absenteeism data were cross-matched with the patient's school annual
      report cards. RESULTS: Children with FAP, CD, and UC missed significantly more
      school days than age-matched healthy controls (17.6 [8.75-30], 24 [14-30], and 21
      [12-25] vs 5.1 [3.75-6.25], respectively, P < 0.001). Compared with children with
      FAP, absenteeism because of medical appointments and hospitalization was
      significantly greater in children with CD and UC (8.8 [4-14] and 7.1 [3-10] vs
      4.4 [2-6.25], P = 0.001). Participation of children with FAP and IBD in various
      school and after-school activities was significantly reduced compared with
      healthy controls. There was no difference in school attendance and functioning
      between children with IBD and FAP. CONCLUSIONS: FAP has a significant impact on
      school attendance and functioning similar to IBD. These findings show that
      significant psychosocial and academic difficulties are faced not only by children
      with chronic diseases like IBD but also by children with FAP.

TI  - Improved integrative framework combining association data with gene expression
      features to prioritize Crohn's disease genes.
PG  - 4147-57
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv142 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified 140
      genome-wide significant loci. However, identification of genes driving
      association signals remains challenging. Furthermore, genome-wide significant
      thresholds limit false positives at the expense of decreased sensitivity. In this
      study, we explored gene features contributing to CD pathogenicity, including
      gene-based association data from CD and autoimmune (AI) diseases, as well as gene
      expression features (eQTLs, epigenetic markers of expression and intestinal gene 
      expression data). We developed an integrative model based on a CD reference gene 
      set. This integrative approach outperformed gene-based association signals alone 
      in identifying CD-related genes based on statistical validation, gene ontology
      enrichment, differential expression between M1 and M2 macrophages and a
      validation using genes causing monogenic forms of inflammatory bowel disease as a
      reference. Besides gene-level CD association P-values, association with AI
      diseases was the strongest predictor, highlighting generalized mechanisms of
      inflammation, and the interferon-gamma pathway particularly. Within the 140
      high-confidence CD regions, 598 of 1328 genes had low prioritization scores,
      highlighting genes unlikely to contribute to CD pathogenesis. For select regions,
      comparably high integrative model scores were observed for multiple genes. This
      is particularly evident for regions having extensive linkage disequilibrium such 
      as the IBD5 locus. Our analyses provide a standardized reference for prioritizing
      potential CD-related genes, in regions with both highly significant and nominally
      significant gene-level association P-values. Our integrative model may be
      particularly valuable in prioritizing rare, potentially private, missense
      variants for which genome-wide evidence for association may be unattainable.

AB  - Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of
      patients with increasingly special health care needs. Transition from a pediatric
      and adolescent healthcare system into an adult medicine setting may be difficult 
      but nevertheless is very important to ensure physiological development of
      adolescent patients and of the continuity of their medical treatment. Transition 
      has shown to be a challenge for pediatricians and adult doctors as well. In
      Germany within the healthcare system there are no special structures established 
      to organize and optimize transition. The German Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology and Nutrition and the German Society of Internal Medicine have
      founded a working group to proceed the process of transition of young patients
      with IBD within the german health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) is a chronic condition
      seen in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association studies have
      implicated >160 genomic loci in IBD with many genes coding for proteins in key
      immune pathways. This study looks at autoimmune disease burden in patients
      diagnosed with PIBD and interrogates exome data of a subset of patients. METHODS:
      Patients were recruited from the Southampton Genetics of PIBD cohort. Clinical
      diagnosis of autoimmune disease in these individuals was ascertained from medical
      records. For a subset of patients with PIBD and concurrent asthma, exome data was
      interrogated to ascertain the burden of pathogenic variants within genes
      implicated in asthma. Association testing was conducted between cases and
      population controls using the SKAT-O test. RESULTS: Forty-nine (28.3%) PIBD
      children (18.49% CD, 8.6% UC, and 21.15% IBDU patients) had a concurrent clinical
      diagnosis of at least one other autoimmune disorder; asthma was the most
      prevalent, affecting 16.2% of the PIBD cohort. Rare and common variant
      association testing revealed 6 significant genes (P < 0.05) before Bonferroni
      adjustment. Three of these genes were previously implicated in both asthma and
      IBD (ZPBP2 IL1R1, and IL18R1) and 3 in asthma only (PYHIN1, IL2RB, and GSTP1).
      CONCLUSIONS: One-third of our cohort had a concurrent autoimmune condition. We
      observed higher incidence of asthma compared with the overall pediatric
      prevalence. Despite a small sample size, SKAT-O evaluated a significant burden of
      rare and common mutations in 6 genes. Variant burden suggests that a systemic
      immune dysregulation rather than organ-specific could underpin immune dysfunction
      for a subset of patients.

TI  - Rac1 Polymorphisms and Thiopurine Efficacy in Children With Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.
PG  - 404-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000820 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thiopurines are effective for maintenance of remission in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in only about half of patients. Predictors of
      response may assist in selecting the most appropriate patients for thiopurine
      therapy. Thiopurines inhibit Rac1, a GTPase that exerts an antiapoptotic effect
      on T-lymphocytes. A genetic association was recently demonstrated between a Rac1 
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and poorer response to thiopurines in adult 
      patients with Crohn disease. We aimed to determine whether Rac1 SNPs are
      associated with response to thiopurines in children with IBD. METHODS: Children
      with IBD treated with thiopurines were prospectively followed for 1 year and were
      genotyped for 3 Rac1 SNPs previously found to be relevant to IBD: rs10951982,
      rs4720672, and rs34932801. The rate of sustained steroid-free remission (SSFR)
      without treatment escalation by 12 months was compared between wild types (WTs)
      and heterozygotes. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were studied (63% boys, 80%
      having Crohn disease, mean age 13 +/- 4.1). Nineteen of the 41 WT (46%) and 9 of 
      the 15 (60%) heterozygotes for rs10951982 were in SSFR (P = 0.55). Similarly, 21 
      of the 45 (47%) WT and 8 of the 12 (67%) heterozygotes for rs4720672 were in
      remission (P = 0.33). Finally, 21 of the 45 (47%) WT and 3 of the 5 (60%)
      heterozygotes for rs34932801 were in remission (P = 0.66). All of the 3
      comparisons remained nonsignificant in a sensitivity analysis of only the
      patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between 
      3 Rac1 SNPs and thiopurine effectiveness by 12 months in a prospective study of
      children with IBD. Other predictors of response should be sought to optimize
      patient selection for thiopurine therapy.

TI  - Probability, rate and timing of reconstructive surgery following colectomy for
      inflammatory bowel disease in Sweden: a population-based cohort study.
PG  - 882-90
LID - 10.1111/codi.12978 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) need colectomy, but the 
      rate of reconstructive surgery with restoration of intestinal continuity is
      unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the probability, rate and
      timing of reconstructive surgery after colectomy in patients with IBD in a
      population-based setting. METHOD: The study cohort included all patients with IBD
      in Sweden who underwent colectomy from 2000 to 2009. Each patient was followed
      from admission for colectomy to admission for reconstructive surgery, date of
      death, migration or 31 December 2010. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and
      multivariable Poisson regression models were used to describe the probability,
      rate and timing of reconstructive surgery. RESULTS: Out of 2818 IBD patients
      treated with colectomy, 61.0% were male and 78.9% had ulcerative colitis. No
      reconstructive surgery had been performed in 1595 (56.6%) patients by the end of 
      follow-up. Of the remaining 1223 patients, 526 underwent primary reconstructive
      surgery and 697 had a secondary reconstruction following a median interval of 357
      days from primary surgery in the form of colectomy. The probability of
      reconstructive surgery was dependent on age (55.6% and 18.1% at ages 15-29 and
      >/= 59 years, respectively), and the chance of reconstructive surgery was higher 
      in hospitals that performed more than 13 colectomies for IBD per year [incidence 
      rate ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.27 (1.09-1.49)]. CONCLUSION: Fewer than 
      half of the patients having a colectomy for IBD underwent subsequent
      reconstructive surgery. Older age and low hospital volume were risk factors for
      no reconstructive surgery.

PG  - 1208-13
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1031166 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of methotrexate (MTX) in the 
      maintenance of clinical remission and mucosal healing in children with Crohn's
      disease (CD), in whom azathioprine (AZA) treatment failed. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study which included all children
      who were diagnosed with CD during a period of 10 years and who received MTX for
      >/=12 months after failed AZA treatment. Remission was assessed clinically,
      defined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index as a score of </=10 and no
      need for the reintroduction of the remission induction therapy. In the subset of 
      patients with sustained clinical remission, the rate of mucosal healing was
      endoscopically assessed. Endoscopic lesions were assessed by Simple Endoscopic
      Score for CD. Each patient served as his or her own historical control. RESULTS: 
      Of the 32 included patients, 22 (68.7%) remained in the stable clinical remission
      after a period of 12 months and 14 (43.8%) did not experience relapse during the 
      whole follow up (median duration 2.9 years; range 1-4.8 years). From all patients
      who were in clinical remission during the entire follow up (n = 14), endoscopy
      was performed in eight (57%) patients and showed complete mucosal healing
      macroscopically (Simple Endoscopic Score for CD score of 0) and microscopically
      in seven out of eight (87.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: MTX was found to be an
      efficient therapeutic alternative in the thiopurine-resistant patients, enabling 
      the complete mucosal healing.

TI  - The association of infliximab trough levels with disease activity in pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1110-7
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1027264 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low serum trough levels (TLs) of infliximab (IFX) and antibodies to
      IFX (ATIs) are associated with the loss of therapeutic response in adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving IFX. Until now, pediatric data are
      scarce. Therefore, we aimed to cross-sectionally investigate the association
      between ATIs and IFX TLs, and clinical and biochemical disease activity in
      children receiving IFX for IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children aged <18 years
      receiving IFX maintenance treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative
      colitis (UC) at three Dutch hospitals were included. Prior to two consecutive IFX
      infusions, IFX TLs and ATI levels were measured. Clinical disease activity was
      determined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Pediatric
      Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), for CD and UC, respectively.
      Biochemical disease activity was assessed by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      fecal calprotectin (FC). Clinical remission was defined as a PUCAI or PCDAI score
      of <10. Therapeutic range of IFX was considered 3-7 microg/ml. RESULTS:
      Thirty-nine patients were included (31 CD; 16 females). Median age was 15 years. 
      Median IFX TL was 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-7]. Subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic
      TLs were found in 38% and 23% of children, respectively. ATIs were detected in
      four patients. A correlation was found between IFX TL and CRP [rs = -0.51; p <
      0.01] and FC [rs = -0.49; p < 0.01]. However, when only clinical disease activity
      was considered, no difference in median TL was found between remission and active
      disease (resp. 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-5] and 2.3 microg/ml [IQR 0.3-4.6]; p = 0.2).
      CONCLUSIONS: IFX TLs are related to biochemical markers of disease activity. This
      could provide a rationale for monitoring TLs in children receiving IFX for IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) that can greatly affect patients' quality of life. We performed a
      prospective study of a large cohort of patients with IBD to determine if patterns
      of anemia over time are associated with aggressive or disabling disease. METHODS:
      We performed a longitudinal analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
      treatment data from a registry of patients with IBD at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2009 through 2013. Patients with a complete
      follow-up evaluation (at least 1 annual visit with laboratory results) were
      included. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria. Disease
      activity scores (the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the ulcerative colitis activity
      index) and quality-of-life scores (based on the short IBD questionnaire) were
      determined at each visit; laboratory data, including levels of C-reactive protein
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, as well as patterns of IBD-related health
      care use, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 410 IBD patients (245 with Crohn's
      disease, 165 with ulcerative colitis; 50.5% female) were included. The prevalence
      of anemia in patients with IBD was 37.1% in 2009 and 33.2% in 2013. Patients with
      IBD and anemia required significantly more health care and had higher indices of 
      disease activity, as well as a lower average quality of life, than patients
      without anemia (P < .0001). Anemia (persistent or recurrent) for 3 or more years 
      was correlated independently with hospitalizations (P < .01), visits to
      gastroenterology clinics (P < .001), telephone calls (P < .004), surgeries for
      IBD (P = .01), higher levels of C-reactive protein (in patients with ulcerative
      colitis, P = .001), and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < .0001).
      Anemia was correlated negatively with quality-of-life scores (P < .03).
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on a longitudinal analysis of 410 patients, persistent or
      recurrent anemia correlates with more aggressive or disabling disease in patients
      with IBD.

AB  - We analyzed a national US database to study the presentation of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to the emergency department (ED). Our results
      indicate that from 2006 to 2010, there was a significant increase in the number
      of ED visits related to children with IBD accompanied by a contemporaneous
      decline in the rate of hospitalization that followed these ED visits. Earlier
      published results have highlighted an increased overall rate of hospitalizations 
      in the United States related to children with IBD. In this context, our results
      support the evidence for an increased prevalence of pediatric IBD in the United
      States in recent years.

TI  - Siblings of patients with Crohn's disease exhibit a biologically relevant
      dysbiosis in mucosal microbial metacommunities.
PG  - 944-53
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-308896 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the existence of mucosal dysbiosis in siblings of
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using 454 pyrosequencing and to
      comprehensively characterise and determine the influence of genotypical and
      phenotypical factors, on that dysbiosis. Siblings of patients with CD have
      elevated risk of developing CD and display aspects of disease phenotype,
      including faecal dysbiosis. Whether the mucosal microbiota is disrupted in these 
      at-risk individuals is unknown. DESIGN: Rectal biopsy DNA was extracted from 21
      patients with quiescent CD, 17 of their healthy siblings and 19 unrelated healthy
      controls. Mucosal microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and
      were classified into core and rare species. Genotypical risk was determined using
      Illumina Immuno BeadChip, faecal calprotectin by ELISA and blood T-cell phenotype
      by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Core microbiota of both patients with CD and healthy 
      siblings was significantly less diverse than controls. Metacommunity profiling
      (Bray-Curtis (SBC) index) showed the sibling core microbial composition to be
      more similar to CD (SBC=0.70) than to healthy controls, whereas the sibling rare 
      microbiota was more similar to healthy controls (SBC=0.42). Faecalibacterium
      prausnitzii contributed most to core metacommunity dissimilarity both between
      siblings and controls, and between patients and controls. Phenotype/genotype
      markers of CD risk significantly influenced microbiota variation between and
      within groups, of which genotype had the largest effect. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals
      with elevated CD-risk display mucosal dysbiosis characterised by reduced
      diversity of core microbiota and lower abundance of F. prausnitzii. This
      dysbiosis in healthy people at risk of CD implicates microbiological processes in
      CD pathogenesis.

TI  - Predicting Endoscopic Crohn's Disease Activity Before and After Induction Therapy
      in Children: A Comprehensive Assessment of PCDAI, CRP, and Fecal Calprotectin.
PG  - 1386-91
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucosal healing (MH) is a vital early endpoint in management of
      Crohn's disease (CD). MH depends on endoscopic assessment and there is increasing
      interest in non-invasive proxies, Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity Index
      (PDCAI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC). These proxies must
      be validated against endoscopic disease activity (SES-CD) at diagnosis and after 
      induction therapy in well characterized cohorts of children with CD. METHODS: A
      prospective cohort of 24 newly diagnosed children (<16 yr) with luminal CD
      quantifiable on complete ileo-colonoscopy had paired PCDAI, CRP, FC and SES-CD at
      diagnosis and after 8 weeks therapy with exclusive enteral nutrition or steroids.
      RESULTS: At diagnosis: PCDAI had poor correlation (r = 0.33); CRP (r = 0.54) and 
      FC (r = 0.46) had moderate correlation with SES-CD. After induction therapy:
      11/24 had inactive disease (SES-CD 0-2); PCDAI (r = 0.34) and CRP (0.28) had poor
      correlation with SES-CD, many children with SES-CD >/=3 having normalization of
      both PCDAI and CRP. FC had good correlation (r = 0.50) but many with SES-CD 0-2
      had FC >200 mug/gm stool. FC<500 (positive likelihood ratio, 3.2) and FC drop
      >50% (positive likelihood ratio, 3.8) had greater predictive value for inactive
      disease. Composite PCDAI (<10), CRP (<5 mg/dl) & FC <500 mug had excellent
      Negative LR (0.2) predicting inactive disease. CONCLUSIONS: PCDAI is unreliable
      for endoscopic disease severity assessment. Only FC correlates with endoscopic
      activity after therapy but cut off <200 mug is too high for defining endoscopic
      recovery in children. Composite normalized PCDAI, CRP and FC <500 mug should be
      considered the non-invasive endpoint for treatment response in pediatric CD.

TI  - IPAA-related sepsis significantly increases morbidity of ileoanal pouch excision.
PG  - 488-93
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000000330 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perineal wound complications after ileoanal pouch excision remain a
      significant cause of morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to
      describe the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of perineal wound complications 
      after pouch excision. DESIGN: This was a retrospective medical chart review.
      SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single clinical institution. PATIENTS:
      Patients who underwent pouch excision at our institution from July 1992 through
      July 2012 were identified. Patient and perioperative variables were reviewed.
      Multivariate and univariate analyses were undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Perineal wound (including perineal wound infection and persistent perineal sinus 
      [nonhealing by 6 months]) and perineal hernia were measured. RESULTS: A total of 
      47 patients (mean age, 46 years; 42.6% men) with familial adenomatous polyposis
      (10.6%), mucosal ulcerative colitis (61.7%), or Crohn's disease (27.7%) underwent
      pouch excision, including 36.2% for IPAA-related sepsis (presacral abscess;
      perineal-, sacral-, or pouch-vaginal fistula; and anastomotic defect), 44.7% for 
      pouch dysfunction, 10.6% for refractory pouchitis, and 8.5% for neoplasia.
      Fourteen (29.8%) developed perineal wound complications, including 100% perineal 
      wound infection, 28.6% persistent perineal sinus, and 7.1% perineal hernia.
      Perineal wound infection was associated with delayed healing (>6 weeks; 71.4% vs 
      24.2%; p = 0.002) and IPAA-related sepsis (28.6% vs 0%; p = 0.001). Patients with
      and without perineal wound complications were similar in age, diagnoses, fecal
      diversion, immunosuppression, comorbid conditions, nutrition, and surgical
      variables. Most patients underwent intersphincteric dissection (87.2%) with
      primary perineal closure (97.0%). Perineal wound complications were significantly
      associated with IPAA-related sepsis as an indication for pouch excision (57.1% vs
      27.2%; p = 0.05), intraoperative pouch perforation (35.7% vs 9.1%, p =0.03), and 
      smoking (21.4% vs 3.0%; p = 0.04). IPAA-related sepsis and a current smoking
      status (OR, 19.3 [95% CI, 1.8 -488.1]) are significant independent predictors on 
      multivariate logistic regression (OR, 6.4 [95% CI, 1.4-30.2]) of perineal wound
      complications. All of the patients with persistent perineal sinus achieved
      successful healing at a median of 734 days (range, 363-2182 days), requiring a
      median of 1.5 procedures. LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center retrospective
      review with a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IPAA-related sepsis
      and current smoking are significant risk factors for perineal wound complications
      after pouch excision.

TI  - Endogenous levels of circulating androgens and risk of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis among women: a nested case-control study from the nurses'
      health study cohorts.
PG  - 1378-85
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgens, which are known to be altered by exogenous hormone use,
      have recently been linked to alterations of the gut microbiome and mucosal immune
      function. No study has evaluated the association between circulating levels of
      androgens and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: 
      We conducted a nested case-control study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health 
      Study and Nurses' Health Study II who provided a blood specimen. Cases of CD and 
      UC were each matched to 2 controls. Prediagnosis plasma levels of
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin
      were measured. We examined the association of each analyte with risk of CD or UC 
      using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Compared with women in the
      lowest quintile of testosterone, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for CD
      were 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.90) for women in the second quintile, 
      0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.15) for the third quartile, 0.22
      (0.08-0.65) for the fourth quintile, and 0.39 (95% confidence interval,
      0.16-0.99) for the highest quintile (Plinear trend = 0.004). In contrast, we did 
      not observe a consistent association between prediagnostic testosterone and risk 
      of UC (Plinear trend = 0.84). We also did not observe any association between
      plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
      and risk of UC or CD (all Plinear trends > 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Among women,
      prediagnostic circulating testosterone is associated with a lower risk of CD but 
      not UC. Further studies to understand the biological mechanisms by which
      endogenous androgens may mediate the etiopathogenesis of CD are warranted.

TI  - Out-of-pocket Cost Burden in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      Cross-sectional Cohort Analysis.
PG  - 1368-77
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000374 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can result in significant morbidity
      requiring frequent health care utilization. Although it is known that the overall
      financial impact of pediatric IBD is significant, the direct out-of-pocket (OOP) 
      cost burden on the parents of children with IBD has not been explored. We
      hypothesized that affected children with a more relapsing disease course and
      families in lower income strata, ineligible for need-based assistance programs,
      disparately absorb ongoing financial stress. METHODS: We completed a
      cross-sectional analysis among parents of children with IBD residing in
      California using an online HIPAA-secure Qualtrics survey. Multicenter recruitment
      occurred between December 4, 2013 and September 18, 2014 at the point-of-care
      from site investigators, informational flyers distributed at regional CCFA
      conferences, and social media campaigns equally targeting Northern, Central, and 
      Southern California. IBD-, patient-, and family-specific information were
      collected from the parents of pediatric patients with IBD patients younger than
      18 years of age at time of study, carry a confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC, reside
      in and receive pediatric gastroenterology care in California, and do not have
      other chronic diseases requiring ongoing medical care. RESULTS: We collected 150 
      unique surveys from parents of children with IBD (67 CD; 83 UC). The median
      patient age was 14 years for both CD and UC, with an overall 3.7 years (SD 2.8
      yr) difference between survey completion and time of IBD diagnosis. Annually,
      63.6%, 28.6%, and 5.3% of families had an OOP cost burden >$500, >$1000, and
      >5000, respectively. Approximately one-third (36.0%) of patients had emergency
      department (ED) visits over the past year, with 59.2% of these patients spending 
      >$500 on emergency department copays, including 11.1% who spent >$5000. Although 
      43.3% contributed <$500 on procedure and test costs, 20.0% spent >$2000 in the
      past year. Families with household income between $50,000 and $100,000 had a
      statistically significant probability (80.6%) of higher annual OOP costs than
      families with lower income <$50,000 (20.0%; P < 0.0001) or higher income
      >$100,000 (64.6%; P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that clinical
      variables associated with uncontrolled IBD states correlated to higher OOP cost
      burden. Annual OOP costs were more likely to be >$500 among patients who had
      increased spending on procedures and tests (odds ratio [OR], 5.63; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 2.73-11.63), prednisone course required over the past year (OR,
      3.19; 95% CI, 1.02-9.92), at least 1 emergency department visit for IBD symptoms 
      (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.33-6.06), at least 4 or more outpatient primary medical
      doctor visits for IBD symptoms (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.40-5.68), and history of 4 or
      more lifetime hospitalizations for acute IBD care (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.13-5.96). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Previously undocumented, a high proportion of pediatric IBD families
      incur substantial OOP cost burden. Patients who are frequently in relapsing and
      uncontrolled IBD states require more acute care services and sustain higher OOP
      cost burden. Lower middle income parents of children with IBD ineligible for
      need-based assistance may be particularly at risk for financial stress from OOP
      costs related to ongoing medical care.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-138
LID - 10.3310/hta19260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition has been shown to be a viable treatment
      option for the management of active Crohn's disease (CD), the evidence regarding 
      its clinical benefits compared with standard treatments (e.g. steroids) for
      maintaining remission in patients with CD has been inconsistent. If enteral
      nutrition was to be effective, the use of drugs such as steroids and
      immunosuppressive drugs could be reduced, thereby reducing the likelihood of
      adverse events associated with these medications. OBJECTIVES: This systematic
      review aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
      elemental nutrition (a type of enteral nutrition) for maintenance of remission in
      patients with CD. DATA SOURCES: Major bibliographic databases (e.g. MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were searched from inception to 
      August/September 2013. Searches were not limited by study design, language or
      publication date. Websites for relevant organisations and references of included 
      studies were checked. METHODS: Experimental randomised and non-randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs and nRCTs) reporting clinical effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of elemental nutrition in the maintenance of remission in
      patients with CD were eligible. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias
      (RoB) assessment were performed independently. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean
      differences (MDs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was
      assessed via forest plots, Cochran's Q and the I2 statistics. Overall, quality of
      evidence for each outcome was rated using the Grading of Recommendations,
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Eight studies (three
      RCTs and five nRCTs) were included in the review. RCTs indicated a significant
      benefit of elemental nutrition vs. no intervention (an unrestricted diet) in
      maintaining remission at 24 months [one RCT; RR 2.06, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 1.00 to 4.43; very low-grade evidence] and preventing relapse at 12-24
      months post baseline (two RCTs; pooled RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84; I2 = 0%;
      high-grade evidence). Similarly, three nRCTs showed significant benefits of
      elemental nutrition over no intervention in maintaining remission at 12-48 months
      and preventing relapse at 12 months post baseline (MD 1.20 months, 95% CI 0.35 to
      2.04 months). The incidence of mucosal healing was not significantly different in
      the intervention and control groups (RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 11.72). Adherence to
      an elemental nutrition regime was significantly worse than adherence to polymeric
      nutrition (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92) and, when compared with other active
      treatments (medications, polymeric nutrition or a combination), elemental
      nutrition yielded non-significant results with wide 95% CIs, rendering these
      results inconclusive. Complications and adverse events were too sparse to allow
      meaningful comparisons. None of the studies reported cost-effectiveness of
      elemental nutrition. Owing to scarcity of data, subgroup and sensitivity analyses
      could not be performed to explore methodological and clinical sources of
      heterogeneity. LIMITATIONS: The findings warrant cautious interpretation given
      the limitations of the evidence in methodological quality (small samples, short
      follow-up) and the RoB in individual studies (lack of blinding, confounding).
      CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence indicates potential benefits of elemental nutrition
      against no intervention in the maintenance of remission and prevention of relapse
      in adult patients with CD. There was a lack or insufficient evidence on adverse
      events and complications. Future large and long-term randomised trials are
      warranted to draw more definitive conclusions regarding the effects of elemental 
      nutrition in maintaining remission in CD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is
      registered as PROSPERO CRD42013005134. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health
      Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

TI  - Imaging of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.
PG  - 797-806
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2015.1031110 [doi]
AB  - Perianal fistula is a complication of Crohn's disease that carries a high
      morbidity. It is a channel that develops between the lower rectum, anal canal and
      perianal or perineal skin. The development of perianal fistulas typically
      connotes a more aggressive disease phenotype and may warrant escalation of
      treatment to prevent poor outcomes over time. Based on fistula anatomy, debris
      can form inside these tracts and cause occlusion, which subsequently leads to
      abscess formation, fever and malaise. The clinical presentation is often with
      complaints of pain, continuous rectal drainage of fecal matter as well as
      malodorous discharge. Considering that the presence of fistulas often indicates
      refractory and aggressive disease, early identification of its presence is
      important. Some patients may not have the classic symptoms of fistulizing disease
      at presentation and others may have significant scarring and/or pain from
      previous fistulizing episodes, which can make an accurate assessment on physical 
      exam alone problematic. As a result, utilizing diagnostic imaging is the best
      means of identifying the early signs of perianal fistulas or abscess formation in
      these patients. Several imaging modalities exist which can be used for diagnosis 
      and management. Endoscopic ultrasound and pelvic MRI are considered the most
      useful in establishing the diagnosis. However, a combination of multiple imaging 
      modalities and/or examination under anesthesia is probably the most ideal.
      Incomplete characterization of the fistula tract(s) extent or the presence of
      abscess carries a high morbidity and far-reaching personal expense for the
      patient - promoting worsening of the disease.

TI  - TELEmedicine for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (TELE-IBD): Design and 
      implementation of randomized clinical trial.

LID - S1551-7144(15)00061-0 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders characterized by worsening of symptoms
      followed by symptom-free periods. Symptoms have a profound negative impact on
      quality of life and are associated with increased health care utilization.
      Despite effective treatments, outcomes are suboptimal secondary to nonadherence, 
      medication intolerance, inconsistent monitoring, poor patient knowledge and
      limited access to care. OBJECTIVES: Compare disease activity and quality of life 
      over 1 year in a randomized trial of IBD patients receiving standard care versus 
      telemedicine. METHODS: Patients evaluated at 3 IBD referral centers with
      worsening symptoms within the last 2 years are eligible for randomization to one 
      of two interventions or standard care. The interventions consist of either every 
      other week or weekly assessment of symptoms, side effects, weight and delivery of
      medication prompts and education via texts to the participant's mobile phone.
      Individualized alerts and action plans are created on a secure portal.
      Participants in the standard care group undergo routine and urgent follow-up
      visits and telephone calls. The primary outcomes group comparisons of changes in 
      disease activity and quality of life scores from baseline to 6 and 12 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Methods such as telemedicine are needed to improve monitoring,
      adherence, self-efficacy, and patient knowledge in IBD. If effective,
      telemedicine should decrease symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease
      health care utilization. The burden associated with use of telemedicine for
      patients and providers needs to be assessed. The trial is ongoing and will be
      completed in July 2016.

PG  - 1265-74
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Escherichia coli can be isolated from lamina propria
      macrophages in Crohn's disease (CD), and their intramacrophage persistence may
      provide a stimulus for inflammation. To further determine the contributions of
      macrophage dysfunction and E. coli pathogenicity to this, we aimed to compare in 
      vitro functioning of macrophages from patients with CD and healthy controls (HC) 
      in response to infection with CD-derived adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) and
      less pathogenic E. coli strains. METHODS: Monocyte-derived macrophages were
      cultured from patients with CD and HC. Intramacrophage survival of E. coli
      strains (CD-derived adherent-invasive [AI] and non-AI strains and laboratory
      strain K-12) was compared. Macrophage cytokine release (tumor necrosis factor
      alpha [TNFalpha], interleukin [IL]-23, IL-8 and IL-10) and monocyte phagoctyosis 
      and respiratory burst function were measured after E. coli infection. For CD
      patients, laboratory data were correlated with clinical phenotype, use of
      immunomodulation, and CD risk alleles (NOD2, IL-23R, ATG16L1 and IRGM). RESULTS: 
      Attenuated TNFalpha and IL-23 release from CD macrophages was found after
      infection with all E. coli strains. There was prolonged survival of CD-derived
      AIEC, CD-derived non-AIEC and E. coli K-12 in macrophages from CD patients
      compared to within those from HC. No abnormality of monocyte phagocytosis or
      respiratory burst function was detected in CD. Macrophage dysfunction in CD was
      not influenced by phenotype, use of immunomodulation or genotype. CONCLUSIONS: CD
      macrophage responses to infection with E. coli are deficient, regardless of
      clinical phenotype, CD genotype or E. coli pathogenicity. This suggests host
      immunodeficiency is an important contributor to intramacrophage E. coli
      persistence in CD.

PG  - 1047-53
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000359 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In case of a loss of response to adalimumab, some patients with
      Crohn's disease may derive benefit from increasing the dosing frequency to 40 mg 
      weekly. Efficacy and safety of adalimumab 80 mg weekly remain unknown. METHODS:
      From February 2011 to September 2012, all adults who had active Crohn's disease, 
      defined at least by Crohn's disease activity index >150 and 1 objective sign of
      inflammation, and required an adalimumab dose escalation to 80 mg weekly were
      enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort study. Crohn's disease activity
      index and C-reactive protein levels were recorded during the first 14 weeks
      following adalimumab optimization and at 6 months. All adverse events were
      recorded. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included. The median age was 33 years,
      and the median disease duration was 8.6 years. Adalimumab was associated with
      steroids in 28% of cases and with immunomodulators in 10% of patients. Within the
      14 weeks after adalimumab optimization, 14 patients (33.3%) achieved clinical
      remission (Crohn's disease activity index <150), and 23 patients (54.8%) had a
      clinical response. Clinical improvement was associated with a drop in the
      C-reactive protein level from 18 to 5 mg/L (P = 0.0008). After a median follow-up
      of 14.5 months, 5 patients underwent major abdominal surgery. Adverse events were
      reported in 13 patients (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab 80 mg weekly seems to be
      well-tolerated and may be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients
      with luminal Crohn's disease who failed to respond to 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every
      other week.

TI  - Management of intra-abdominal abscesses in children with Crohn's disease: a
      12-year, retrospective single-center review.
PG  - 1109-14
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal abscesses (IAA) are complications of Crohn's disease,
      which often result in hospitalization, surgery, and increased cost. Initial
      management may include medical therapy, percutaneous drainage (PD), or surgery,
      although the optimal management of IAA in children is unclear. METHODS:
      Retrospective review of all pediatric patients with Crohn's disease who developed
      an IAA from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2012. Three groups, based on initial IAA
      treatment modality (medical, PD, and surgery), were compared. RESULTS: Thirty
      cases of IAA were identified (mean age at IAA diagnosis, 15.4 +/- 2.6 yr, 67%
      female, median Crohn's disease duration, 2.6 mo). Computed tomography was the
      most common initial (93%) and follow-up (47%) imaging. The average time to
      follow-up imaging was 8.5 days. For initial management, 18 received medical
      therapy, 10 PD, and 2 had surgery. The medical therapy group received more
      computed tomography scans for follow-up imaging than the PD group (12 [67%]
      versus 2 [20%], P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in abscess
      characteristics or management of posttreatment course between these 2 groups.
      Surgical resection occurred in 3 patients (17%) in the medical group and 2 (20%) 
      in the PD group during index hospitalization. No significant differences were
      identified among treatment groups for readmissions, complications, or abscess
      recurrence. By 1 year, 12 of the 18 medically managed patients (67%) had surgery,
      and 6 of the 10 patients (60%) treated with initial PD ultimately had surgery.
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with IAA require definitive surgical
      treatment, and there were no clear predictors of those who did not.

TI  - Whey and soy protein supplements changes body composition in patients with
      Crohn's disease undergoing azathioprine and anti-TNF-alpha therapy.
PG  - 1603-10
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.4.8362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause. Malnutrition associated with active CD
      has been reduced although obesity has increased. Dietary strategies such as those
      with high-protein have been proposed to reduce body fat. This study compares the 
      effects of two supplements on the nutritional status of CD patients. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: 68 CD patients were randomized in two groups: whey protein group
      (WP) and soy protein group (SP). Using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and
      albumin and pre-albumin dosages the nutritional status was measured before
      starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The disease activity was
      determined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum C-reactive protein dosage 
      and dietary intake by 24h dietary recalls. RESULTS: Forty-one patients concluded 
      the study and both supplements changed body composition similarly. Triceps skin
      fold thickness (p< 0.001) and body fat percentage (p=0.001) decreased, whereas
      mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.004), corrected arm muscle area (p=0.005) and
      body lean percentage (p=0.001) increased. CONCLUSIONS: For Crohn's disease
      patients undergoing anti TNF-alpha and azatioprine therapies, supplementation
      with whey and soy proteins changes body composition through reduction of body fat
      and thus contributes to control inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in care and outcomes contribute to mortality and
      morbidity in children; however, the role in pediatric Crohn's disease is unclear.
      In this study, we compared cohorts of black and white children with Crohn's
      disease to determine the extent race is associated with differences in
      readmissions, complications, and procedures among hospitalizations in the United 
      States. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Pediatric Health Information System
      (January 1, 2004-June 30, 2012) for patients with 21 years or younger
      hospitalized with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. White and black cohorts were
      randomly selected in a 2:1 ratio by hospital. The primary outcome was time from
      index hospital discharge to readmission. The most frequent complications and
      procedures were evaluated by race. RESULTS: There were 4377 patients. Black
      children had a shorter time to first readmission and higher probability of
      readmission (P = 0.009) and a 16% increase in risk of readmission compared with
      white children (P = 0.01). Black children had longer length of stay and higher
      frequency of overall and late (30-d to 12-mo postdischarge) readmissions (P <
      0.001). During index hospitalization, more black children had perianal disease
      and anemia (P < 0.001). During any hospitalization, black children had higher
      incidence of perianal disease, anemia, and vitamin D deficiency, and greater
      number of perianal procedures, endoscopies, and blood product transfusion (P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in hospital readmissions,
      complications, and procedures among hospitalized children related to race. It is 
      unclear whether these differences are due to genetic differences, worse intrinsic
      disease, adherence, access to treatment, or treatment disparities.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to
      arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a
      genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal
      inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation 
      and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been
      identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset
      and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize
      with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that
      the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular
      anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense
      mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary
      deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk
      factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in
      the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.

PG  - 879-87
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000323 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Genetics, Environmental, Microbial Project is a multicenter study
      assessing etiological factors in Crohn's disease by studying healthy first-degree
      relatives (FDRs) of individuals affected by Crohn's disease. We aimed to evaluate
      the contribution of genetic, microbial, and environmental factors to the
      determination of intestinal permeability in healthy FDRs. METHODS: IP was
      assessed using the lactulose-mannitol ratio (LacMan ratio). FDRs were genotyped
      for 167 inflammatory bowel disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms.
      Taxonomic profile of the fecal microbiota was determined by Illumina MiSeq
      pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA. The associations of LacMan ratio with
      demographic factors, inflammatory bowel disease-associated single nucleotide
      polymorphisms and the fecal microbiota were assessed. RESULTS: One thousand, one 
      hundred ninety-six white FDRs were included [corrected]. Eleven percent of FDRs
      had an elevated LacMan ratio (>/=0.03). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that
      younger subjects and nonsmokers had higher LacMan ratios, P = 3.62 x 10(-)(4) and
      P = 0.03, respectively. The LacMan ratio was not significantly heritable, H2r,
      0.13, P = 0.13. There was no association between any of the 167 inflammatory
      bowel disease-associated risk variants and LacMan ratio nor was there a
      correlation between fecal microbial composition and the LacMan ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: We did not find LacMan ratio to be significantly heritable
      suggesting that the contribution of genetic factors to the determination of
      intestinal permeability in healthy FDRs is modest. Environmental factors, such as
      smoking, are likely more important determinants. The effect of age on intestinal 
      barrier function has been underappreciated.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and exposure-efficacy relationship of adalimumab in pediatric
      patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease: results from a randomized,
      multicenter, phase-3 study.
PG  - 783-92
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1kappa) to tumor
      necrosis factor, has shown benefit in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and the serum concentration-efficacy relationship of adalimumab in pediatric
      patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. METHODS: The safety, efficacy, 
      and PK of adalimumab was evaluated in a phase-3, randomized, double-blind,
      52-week study (IMAgINE-1, N = 192), which had a 4-week open-label induction phase
      (dose was determined by patient weight) followed by a 48-week double-blind
      maintenance phase (standard and low-dose arms, drug given every other week).
      Trough serum adalimumab (baseline, weeks 2, 4, 16, 26, and 52) and
      anti-adalimumab antibody measurements (baseline, weeks 16, 26, and 52) were
      collected. Disease activity was assessed using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index. RESULTS: At week 52, adalimumab trough concentrations (mean +/-
      SD) were higher for patients in the standard-dose (9.48 +/- 5.61 mug/mL) compared
      with the low-dose (3.51 +/- 2.21 mug/mL) arm. In patients whose doses were
      increased from every other week to weekly, higher trough concentrations were
      observed after dose escalation. Higher body weight, baseline C-reactive protein, 
      and lower baseline albumin levels were associated with greater clearance of
      adalimumab. An exposure (serum concentration)-efficacy relationship was observed,
      in which higher concentrations of adalimumab were associated with greater rates
      of remission. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to describe the PK of
      adalimumab in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. A
      positive association between serum adalimumab concentration and
      remission/response was identified.

TI  - Developing in vitro expanded CD45RA+ regulatory T cells as an adoptive cell
      therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 584-94
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thymus-derived regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate dominant
      peripheral tolerance and treat experimental colitis. Tregs can be expanded from
      patient blood and were safely used in recent phase 1 studies in graft versus host
      disease and type 1 diabetes. Treg cell therapy is also conceptually attractive
      for Crohn's disease (CD). However, barriers exist to this approach. The stability
      of Tregs expanded from Crohn's blood is unknown. The potential for adoptively
      transferred Tregs to express interleukin-17 and exacerbate Crohn's lesions is of 
      concern. Mucosal T cells are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression in active CD.
      The capacity for expanded Tregs to home to gut and lymphoid tissue is unknown.
      METHODS: To define the optimum population for Treg cell therapy in CD,
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(-) Treg subsets 
      were isolated from patients' blood and expanded in vitro using a workflow that
      can be readily transferred to a good manufacturing practice background. RESULTS: 
      Tregs can be expanded from the blood of patients with CD to potential target dose
      within 22-24 days. Expanded CD45RA(+) Tregs have an epigenetically stable FOXP3
      locus and do not convert to a Th17 phenotype in vitro, in contrast to CD45RA(-)
      Tregs. CD45RA(+) Tregs highly express alpha4beta7 integrin, CD62L and CC motif
      receptor 7 (CCR7). CD45RA(+) Tregs also home to human small bowel in a C.B-17
      severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) xenotransplant model. Importantly, in
      vitro expansion enhances the suppressive ability of CD45RA(+) Tregs. These cells 
      also suppress activation of lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes 
      isolated from inflamed Crohn's mucosa. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) Tregs may be the most appropriate population from
      which to expand Tregs for autologous Treg therapy for CD, paving the way for
      future clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few case reports describe the clinical features of pancreatic
      involvement in inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To investigate prevalence and
      disease course of inflammatory bowel disease children with pancreatitis and with 
      exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. METHODS: We used a web-registry to 
      retrospectively identify paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients with
      hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. Participants were re-evaluated at 6 months
      and 1 year. RESULTS: From a total of 649 paediatric patients, we found 27 with
      hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia (4.1%). Eleven patients (1.6%) fulfilled
      diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Female gender was significantly
      associated with acute pancreatitis (p=0.04). Twenty-five children (92.5%) had
      colonic disease. At 6 months 1/11 children with acute pancreatitis (9%) showed
      acute recurrent pancreatitis, while 1 patient (9%) had persistent hyperamylasemia
      and hyperlipasemia. At 12 months, 1 patient showed chronic pancreatitis (9.1%).
      Of the 16 children with exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia, 4 developed
      acute pancreatitis (25%), while 1 patient (6.2%) still presented exclusive
      hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia at 6 months. At 12 months, 11/16 patients
      (68.7%) reached a remission of pancreatic involvement, whereas 5 remaining
      patients (32.3%) had persistent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In inflammatory bowel disease children, acute pancreatitis is more common in
      colonic disease and in female gender. Pancreatic function should be monitored,
      considering that pancreatic damage may evolve.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients may be at a higher risk for developing 
      infections due to underlying disease, malnutrition, surgery, or immunosuppressive
      therapy. Therefore, protecting this group against infections is of particular
      importance. Immunisation against vaccine-preventable diseases is strongly
      recommended. This article for the first time summarises data on immunogenicity
      and safety of vaccines in IBD children and provides an update on some important
      issues regarding immunisation in these group of children.

PG  - 399-405
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-305812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biological agents are being increasingly used in the UK for 
      paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) despite limited evidence and
      safety concerns. We evaluated effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting,
      highlighting drug cost pressures, using our national Scottish PIBD biological
      registry. METHODS: Complete usage of the biological agents, infliximab (IFX) and 
      adalimumab (ADA) for treatment of PIBD (in those aged <18 years) from 1 January
      2000 to 30 September 2010 was collated from all treatments administered within
      the Scottish Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (PGHAN)
      national managed service network (all regional PGHAN centres and paediatric units
      within their associated district general hospitals). RESULTS: 132 children had
      biological therapy; 24 required both agents; 114 had Crohn's disease (CD), 16 had
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 had IBD Unclassified (IBDU). 127 children received 
      IFX to induce remission; 61 entered remission, 49 had partial response and 17 had
      no response. 72 were given maintenance IFX and 23 required dose escalation. 18
      had infusion reactions and 27 had adverse events (infections/other adverse
      events). 29 had ADA to induce remission (28 CD and 1 UC), 24 after IFX; 10
      entered remission, 12 had partial response and 7 had no response. All had
      maintenance; 19 required dose escalation. 12 children overall required
      hospitalisation due to drug toxicity. No deaths occurred with either IFX or ADA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Complete accrual of the Scottish nationwide 'real-life' experience
      demonstrates moderate effectiveness of anti tumour necrosis factor agents in
      severe PIBD but duration of effect is limited; significant financial issues (drug
      cost-need for dose escalation and/or multiple biological usage) and safety issues
      exist.

      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: This study included 38
      CD patients and 33 controls. Low serum retinol concentrations were detected in
      29% of CD patients vs 15% in controls (P < 0.005). The RDR test was positive in
      37% of CD patients vs 12% in controls, which indicated inadequate hepatic vitamin
      A stores (P < 0.005). Individuals with hypovitaminosis A had lower BMI and body
      fat compared with those without this deficiency. There was no association between
      vitamin A deficiency and its dietary intake, ileal location, presence of disease 
      activity and prior bowel resections. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD have higher
      prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, as assessed by two independent methods.

TI  - Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal
      tuberculosis: Frequency and relation with disease phenotype.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1007/s12664-015-0538-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), as well as
      intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) from Asia, are underreported. We, therefore,
      describe the prevalence of EIMs in Indian IBD and ITB patients and study their
      relationship with disease extent and severity in IBD. METHODS: This retrospective
      single-center study included all IBD and ITB patients evaluated from January 2005
      to July 2012. Disease profile and frequencies of arthropathies (peripheral and
      central) and ocular (episcleritis, iritis/uveitis), oral (aphthous stomatitis),
      skin (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, psoriasis), hepatobiliary (primary 
      sclerosing cholangitis), and thromboembolic manifestations were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Of 1,652 patients (1146 UC, 303 CD, 203 ITB), frequency of any EIM was
      33.2 %, 38.3 %, and 14.3 % in UC, CD, and ITB patients, respectively.
      Thromboembolism was more common among UC patients with pancolitis than proctitis 
      (p < 0.001) and left-sided colitis (p = 0.02). Primary sclerosing cholangitis was
      seen in 0.4 % UC patients. Steroid-dependent UC patients had higher frequency of 
      any EIM, peripheral arthropathy, or thromboembolism than patients with no or
      infrequent steroid requirement (p < 0.05). Peripheral arthropathy (p = 0.02),
      erythema nodosum (p = 0.01), and aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.004) were more common
      with CD than with UC patients. Patients with colonic CD had higher frequency of
      peripheral arthropathy, any EIM, and multiple EIMs than ileal or ileocolonic
      disease (p < 0.05). Relative to ITB, CD patients had higher frequencies of
      peripheral arthropathy (p < 0.001), aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.01), any EIM (p < 
      0.001), and multiple EIMs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Indian IBD and ITB
      patients, EIMs appear to be related to disease severity in UC and disease
      location in CD and are significantly more common in CD than in ITB. Overall
      prevalence of EIMs in these patients is similar to that of the West.

TI  - Role of exclusive enteral nutrition in the preoperative optimization of patients 
      with Crohn's disease following immunosuppressive therapy.
PG  - e478
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000478 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a study to evaluate the impact of the exclusive enteral nutrition
      (EEN) on perioperative outcome in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following
      immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with CD followed at a referral center between
      January 2001 and March 2014 who underwent abdominal surgery were identified.
      Patients were divided into 4 groups: patients not exposed to immunosuppressive
      agents in the previous 8 weeks before surgery (group 1); patients received
      immunosuppressive medications without preoperative drug-free interval (group 2); 
      patients had preoperative immunosuppressants-free interval (group 3); patients
      treated with adding EEN to preoperative immunosuppressants-free interval regimen 
      (group 4). Urgent operation requirement, stoma creation, postoperative
      complications, readmission, and reoperation were compared in patients among
      groups. Overall, 708 abdominal surgeries performed in 498 CD patients were
      identified. Three hundred seventy-six (53.11%) surgeries performed in those
      receiving preoperative immunosuppressive medications. Compared with other groups,
      group 2 had increased postoperative complications, more frequent urgent
      operation, and higher rate of stoma creation. Patients in group 4 were found to
      have better outcome including lower rate of stoma creation (P < 0.05), and
      decreased incidence of postoperative complications (P < 0.05) compared with group
      2 and group 3. Additionally, decreased urgent operation requirement (P < 0.05)
      and extended preoperative drug-free interval (P < 0.001) were observed in the
      group 4 than those in the group 3. Preoperative optimization of CD following
      immunosuppressive therapy by EEN prolongs the immunosuppressants-free interval,
      reduces the risk of urgent surgery and reoperation, and most importantly,
      decreases complications after abdominal surgery.

TI  - Chemokine receptor CCR7 regulates the intestinal TH1/TH17/Treg balance during
      Crohn's-like murine ileitis.
PG  - 1011-22
LID - 10.1189/jlb.3HI0614-303R [doi]
AB  - The regulation of T cell and DC retention and lymphatic egress within and from
      the intestine is critical for intestinal immunosurveillance; however, the
      cellular processes that orchestrate this balance during IBD remain poorly
      defined. With the use of a mouse model of TNF-driven Crohn's-like ileitis
      (TNF(Delta) (ARE)), we examined the role of CCR7 in the control of intestinal T
      cell and DC retention/egress during experimental CD. We observed that the
      frequency of CCR7-expressing TH1/TH17 effector lymphocytes increased during
      active disease in TNF(Delta) (ARE) mice and that DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) mice
      developed exacerbated ileitis and multiorgan inflammation, with a marked
      polarization and ileal retention of TH1 effector CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore,
      adoptive transfer of DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) effector CD4(+) into lymphopenic hosts
      resulted in ileo-colitis, whereas those transferred with DeltaARE/CCR7(+/+)
      CD4(+) T cells developed ileitis. DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) mice had an acellular
      draining MLN, decreased CD103(+) DC, and decreased expression of RALDH enzymes
      and of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs. Lastly, a mAb against CCR7 exacerbated
      ileitis in TNF(Delta) (ARE) mice, phenocopying the effects of congenital CCR7
      deficiency. Our data underscore a critical role for the lymphoid chemokine
      receptor CCR7 in orchestrating immune cell traffic and TH1 versus TH17 bias
      during chronic murine ileitis.

TI  - Serum C-reactive protein and CRP genotype in pediatric inflammatory bowel

PG  - 596-605
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000296 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant. Patients with
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) differ from adult patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease with regard to phenotype, inflammatory profile, and
      treatment response. We hypothesized that variations in CRP and CRP genotype
      influence PIBD phenotype, natural history, and remission after anti-tumor
      necrosis factor alpha therapy. METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms
      tagging CRP (rs1935193, rs1130864, rs1205, rs1417938, rs11265263, and rs1800947) 
      were genotyped in 465 patients with PIBD (diagnosed <17 yr). Phenotyping was
      serially performed until last follow-up and serum CRP levels recorded at
      diagnosis and before biological therapy in a subgroup. RESULTS: CRP haplotype
      (ATGCTC) differed in those diagnosed <10 years, with rs1205T more frequent in
      Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.009); the haplotype
      ATGCTC was less frequent in UC (P = 0.002). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (rs1205, rs1130864, and rs1417938) showed association with elevated CRP levels at
      diagnosis. CRP genotype had no association with CD phenotype or natural history. 
      CRP was more frequently raised at diagnosis in CD than UC (63% versus 22%, P <
      0.0001). Elevated CRP at diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of
      progression to surgery in patients with CD (P < 0.0001) and the need for
      azathioprine in the overall PIBD cohort (P = 0.002). There was no effect of CRP
      genotype or serum CRP on the achievement of remission using anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CRP and CRP genotype differ between pediatric 
      patients with CD and UC with a high inflammatory burden at diagnosis suggesting a
      worse prognosis. Additional evaluation of CRP in inflammatory bowel disease
      pathogenesis and natural history is now warranted.

AB  - This article reports the findings of what it means to live with intestinal
      failure caused by Crohn disease and how it influences daily life. Ten patients, 7
      with an ostomy and 7 on home parenteral nutrition followed up at an outpatient
      clinic for patients with intestinal failure, were interviewed using a
      qualitative, phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The analysis of the transcribed
      data is described thematically and resulted in 3 main themes; (a) struggling to
      not be controlled by the disease, (b) walking on a thin thread, and (c) being
      seen as a person, not just as a patient. These themes led to the comprehensive
      understanding that living with intestinal failure was interpreted as the
      criticality of maintaining control over one's life and body while maintaining
      autonomy and not letting the disease conquer life. Life entails a constant
      struggle with much planning to live as normally as possible and get the most out 
      of life. It was of great importance to be seen as a person and not just as a
      disease, affirm that life as it is has meaning, there is a state of suffering
      related to the disease, there are existential issues, and suffering is related to
      care.

TI  - Impact of enteral nutrition on energy metabolism in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1299-304
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i4.1299 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition (EN) on the body composition 
      and metabolism in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Sixty-one patients
      diagnosed with CD were enrolled in this study. They were given only EN (enteral
      nutritional suspension, TPF, non-elemental diet) support for 4 wk, without any
      treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, infliximab or by
      surgical operation. Body composition statistics such as weight, body mass index, 
      skeletal muscle mass (SMM), fat mass, protein mass and inflammation indexes such 
      as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CD activity
      index (CDAI) were recorded before and after EN support. RESULTS: The 61 patients 
      were divided into three groups according to CDAI before and after EN support: A
      (active phase into remission via EN, n=21), B (remained in active phase before
      and after EN, n=19) and C (in remission before and after EN, n=21). Patients in
      group A had a significant increase in SMM (22.11+/-4.77 kg vs 23.23+/-4.49 kg,
      P=0.044), protein mass (8.01+/-1.57 kg vs 8.44+/-1.45 kg, P=0.019) and decrease
      in resting energy expenditure (REE) per kilogram (27.42+/-5.01 kcal/kg per day vs
      22.62+/-5.45 kcal/kg per day, P<0.05). There was no significant difference
      between predicted and measured REE in active CD patients according to the
      Harris-Benedict equation. There was no linear correlation between the measured
      REE and CRP, ESR or CDAI in active CD patients. CONCLUSION: EN could decrease the
      hypermetabolism in active CD patients by reducing the inflammatory response.

AB  - Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known
      about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal
      in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free
      virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a
      significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC
      patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that
      expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in
      bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome 
      may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude
      that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for,
      human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a
      role in other diseases.

TI  - Risk factors for decreased bone mineral density in inflammatory bowel disease: A 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk 
      for metabolic bone disease, studies analyzing this correlation have identified
      various risk factors, including disease phenotype, age, sex and steroid therapy. 
      Furthermore, few studies have assessed risk factors for bone loss in Japanese IBD
      patients. This study analyzed risk factors for metabolic bone disease in Japanese
      IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 388 patients with IBD 
      aged 20-50 years, including 232 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 156 with Crohn's
      disease (CD). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck, total femur and lumbar
      spine was quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The blood
      concentrations of bone metabolism markers were measured. History of smoking and
      bone fracture, and nutritional intake were assessed using questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Of the 388 patients with IBD, 78 (20.1%; UC, 17.2%; CD, 24.4%) had
      osteopenia and 17 (4.4%; UC, 3.4%; CD, 5.8%) had osteoporosis, as assessed by
      T-score. Bone mineral density of the lumbar vertebrae was lower in males than in 
      females. Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk factors for bone loss 
      in UC patients were male sex, low body mass index (BMI), high steroid dose and
      disease location. Risk factors for bone loss in CD patients were male sex and low
      BMI. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese patients with IBD, male sex and low BMI were
      associated with increased risk for metabolic bone disease. In addition, Steroid
      therapy shouldn't be indiscriminate in UC patients. These findings may help
      identify patients at particularly high risk of metabolic bone disease and may
      help implement appropriate therapies in a timely manner and improve long-term
      quality of life.

TI  - Increased risk of stroke among patients with Crohn's disease: a population-based 
      matched cohort study.
PG  - 645-53
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2132-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is one type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      that has been speculated to share prognostic factors with the development of
      stroke. There is controversial information in the literature regarding the
      association between CD and stroke. The present cohort study estimated the risk of
      subsequent stroke among CD patients compared with matched comparison subjects
      drawn from a population-based dataset in Taiwan. METHOD: This study drew data
      from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to conduct a historical cohort
      study. The study cohort comprised 3309 CD patients, and the comparison cohort
      comprised 13,236 subjects without an IBD. Cox proportional hazards regressions
      were performed to estimate the risk of subsequent stroke during the follow-up
      period. We also conducted additional analyses stratifying by age group and
      gender. RESULTS: After adjusting for selected medical co-morbidities and recent
      prescriptions of selected pharmaceuticals, the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent
      stroke among patients with CD was found to be 1.911 (95% confidence interval (CI)
      = 1.65-2.22) that of comparison subjects. While we did not detect an association 
      between stroke and CD among patients aged 30-40 years, we did detect increased
      risks for stroke among CD patients aged 40-50 years (HR = 2.29) and those aged
      over 50 years (HR = 1.88). We also found women (HR = 2.39) to be at a greater
      risk than men (HR = 1.50). CONCLUSION: This study reports an increased HR for
      subsequent stroke among CD patients when compared to matched comparison patients 
      without IBD in an Asian population.

AB  - PURPOSE: Children with perianal Crohn's disease (PCD) are a unique and diverse
      patient population. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of
      disease and role of surgery. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all
      children having at least one surgical intervention for PCD over 10 years was
      performed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (63% male) aged 0.5-17 (median 13) years
      were identified. Perianal disease consisted of skin tags (49%), superficial
      fistulae (49%), deep fistulae (37%), superficial abscesses (68%), deep abscesses 
      (9%), skin breakdown (19%), and anal strictures (7%). 84% received anti-TNF
      therapy, with 27% treated with a second anti-TNF medication. Minor surgical
      procedures, commonly done during anti-TNF therapy, included abscess drainage
      (67%) and seton placement (33%). Major surgical procedures, done almost
      exclusively after anti-TNF failure, included defunctioning ileostomy (23%) and
      subtotal colectomy (9%). Follow-up ranged from 7 to 160 (median 54) months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric PCD has a wide range of disease severity. Minor surgery
      provides adequate drainage before and during anti-TNF therapy, while major
      surgery plays a role in medically refractory disease. Appropriate surgical
      intervention remains an important part of the treatment paradigm.

TI  - Distinct management issues with Crohn's disease of the small intestine.
PG  - 92-7
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000149 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Small bowel Crohn's disease can present with clinical
      challenges that are specific to its location. In this review, we address some of 
      the areas that present particular problems in small bowel Crohn's disease. RECENT
      FINDINGS: A key issue specific to small bowel Crohn's disease relates to its
      diagnosis given that access to the small bowel is limited. Radiological advances,
      particularly in small bowel ultrasonography and MRI, as well as the introduction 
      of capsule endoscopy and balloon enteroscopy are helping to address this. In
      addition, our ability to differentiate small bowel Crohn's disease from other
      causes of inflammation, such as tuberculosis, is improving on the basis of better
      understanding of the features that differentiate these conditions. It is also
      becoming apparent that jejunal Crohn's disease represents a distinct disease
      phenotype with potentially worse clinical outcomes. Finally, because it is a rare
      complication, our understanding of small bowel cancer associated with Crohn's
      disease remains limited. Recent publications are, however, starting to improve
      our knowledge of this condition. SUMMARY: Although small bowel Crohn's disease
      presents specific management issues not seen in patients with Crohn's disease
      elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract, our knowledge of how to manage these is 
      improving.

TI  - Antibodies to infliximab are associated with lower infliximab levels and
      increased likelihood of surgery in pediatric IBD.
PG  - 307-14
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult studies suggest antibodies to infliximab (ATI) correlate with
      loss of response in inflammatory bowel disease but pediatric data are limited.
      METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of trough infliximab levels and ATI
      in 134 pediatric and young adult patients receiving infliximab. At the time serum
      was obtained demographics, disease phenotype, duration of infliximab therapy, use
      of combination therapy (methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine with infliximab), and
      surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Assays were performed on 134 subjects currently
      receiving infliximab (85 male; mean age, 17.3 +/- 4.3 years; 114 Crohn's disease 
      and 20 ulcerative colitis). Infliximab use ranged from 12 days to 12 years:
      median 2.0 (interquartile range [1.1-4.3]) years. Twenty-seven of 134 (20%)
      patients had ATI >/=5 U/mL. Of patients with ATI >/=5 U/mL, 59% had infliximab
      levels <5 mug/mL, compared with 14% of patients with ATI <5 U/mL (P < 0.001). Ten
      (7%) patients (9 Crohn's disease, 1 ulcerative colitis) underwent bowel
      resections after beginning infliximab infusions. Sixty percent who underwent
      surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL; in contrast, only 8% of patients who did not undergo 
      surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL (P = 0.01). At the time of serum sampling, 50 (37%)
      patients were receiving combination therapy, compared with 84 (63%) on infliximab
      alone. Combination therapy at the time of serum sampling did not correlate with
      either increase infliximab levels or lower ATI compared with infliximab
      monotherapy. However, prior immunomodulator use was associated with lower
      antibody levels (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: ATI correlates with reduction in
      infliximab level and a higher risk of surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in youth with Crohn disease: role of disease
      activity and parenting stress.
PG  - 749-53
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000696 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important, but
      understudied construct in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Family level
      predictors of HRQOL have been understudied as are the mechanisms through which
      disease activity affects HRQOL. The present study examines the relation between a
      family level factor (parenting stress) and HRQOL in youth with Crohn disease.
      Parenting stress is examined as a mechanism through which disease activity
      affects HRQOL. METHODS: A total of 99 adolescents with Crohn disease and their
      parents were recruited across 3 sites. Adolescents completed the IMPACT-III
      (inflammatory bowel disease-specific HRQOL). Parents completed the Pediatric
      Inventory for Parents, a measure of medically related parenting stress that
      assesses stress because of the occurrence of medical stressors and stress because
      of the perceived difficulty of stressors. Disease activity was obtained from
      medical records. RESULTS: Parenting stress because of the occurrence of medical
      stressors partially mediated the disease severity-HRQOL relation, reducing the
      relation between these variables from 49.67% to 31.58% (B= -0.56, P < 0.0001).
      Bootstrapping analysis confirmed that the indirect effect of disease severity on 
      HRQOL via parenting stress significantly differed from zero. Parenting stress
      because of the perceived difficulty of medical stressors partially mediated the
      disease severity-HRQOL relation, reducing the relation from 49.67% to 30.29% (B= 
      -0.55, P < 0.0001). The indirect effect was confirmed via bootstrapping
      procedures. CONCLUSIONS: As disease severity increased, parenting stress also
      increased, and adolescent HRQOL decreased. Parenting stress should be considered 
      and assessed for along with medical factors as part of a comprehensive approach
      to improve HRQOL in adolescents with Crohn disease.

      clinical remission in children with moderate to severe Crohn disease.
PG  - 580-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000684 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety
      of 2 protocols of maintenance therapy with infliximab (IFX) and an
      immunomodulatory agent in pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD): withdrawal 
      of immunomodulators versus continuation of immunosuppressants. METHODS: The
      present multicenter randomized open-label trial included 99 patients with CD
      (ages 14.5 +/- 2.6 years) who were administered IFX (5 mg/kg body weight) along
      with an immunomodulatory agent (azathioprine 1.5-3 mg/kg body weight per day,
      methotrexate 10-25 mg/week). After 10 weeks of the induction therapy, 84
      responders were centrally randomized into 1 of the following groups: group I (n =
      45) in which IFX and an immunomodulatory agent were continued up to week 54 and
      group II (n = 39) in which the immunomodulatory agent was discontinued after 26
      weeks. RESULTS: The induction therapy was reflected by a significant decrease in 
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Simplified Endoscopic
      Activity Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) values. After the maintenance phase, 
      the analyzed groups did not differ significantly in terms of the clinical
      response loss rates and final PCDAI and SES-CD scores. Furthermore, no
      significant intragroup differences were documented between mean PCDAI scores
      determined at the end of induction and maintenance phases.
      Intensification/modification of the treatment was required in 13 of 45 (29%) and 
      11 of 39 (28%) patients of groups I and II, respectively. A total of 9 serious
      adverse events were documented; none of the patients died during the trial.
      CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six weeks likely represent the safe duration of combined
      IFX/immunomodulatory therapy in our sample of pediatric patients with CD.

TI  - Measures of obesity and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 361-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with intestinal-specific inflammation.
      Nonetheless, a specific role of obesity in the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of U.S.
      women enrolled in 1989 in the Nurses' Health Study II. At baseline, we collected 
      information on height, weight, waist and hip circumference, weight at age 18, and
      body shape at age 20. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard 
      ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 111,498 women (median
      age, 35 yr), we documented 153 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 229 cases of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) more than 18 years of follow-up, encompassing 2,028,769
      person-years. Compared with women with normal BMI, the multivariate-adjusted
      hazard ratios of CD were 2.33 (95% CI, 1.15-4.69) for obese women at age 18 and
      1.58 (95% CI, 1.01-2.47) for obese women at baseline. Increasing weight gain
      between age 18 and baseline was associated with increased risk of CD (Ptrend =
      0.04). Adolescent body habitus was also associated with risk of CD with a
      multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of CD of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07-2.50) for women
      with overweight/obese body shape compared with women with a thin/slender body
      shape. We did not observe a significant association between any of these
      anthropometric measures and risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In a large prospective
      cohort of U.S. women, measures of adiposity were associated with an increased
      risk of CD but not UC. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the biological 
      mechanisms by which excess adiposity may increase the risk of CD.

TI  - High-density mapping of the MHC identifies a shared role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in
      inflammatory bowel diseases and heterozygous advantage in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 172-9
LID - 10.1038/ng.3176 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong 
      evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This
      region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the
      antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Studies in 
      IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and
      non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the
      architecture of association and causal alleles. To address this, we performed
      high-density SNP typing of the MHC in >32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating
      multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between
      these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and
      heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important
      role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the
      pathogenesis of IBD.

TI  - Intestinal inflammation and impact on growth in children with cystic fibrosis.
PG  - 521-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000683 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare faecal markers of
      intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), and determine
      whether intestinal inflammation adversely affects the nutritional phenotype.
      METHODS: Faecal samples for markers of intestinal inflammation, calprotectin,
      S100A12, and osteoprotegerin, were collected from children with CF, healthy
      controls (HCs), and Crohn disease (CD). Associations between inflammatory markers
      and clinical and nutritional indices were determined in subjects with CF.
      RESULTS: Twenty-eight children with CF (mean [standard deviation (SD)] 8.4 [3.3] 
      years old, 22 pancreatic insufficient [PI]), 47 HC, and 30 CD were recruited.
      Mean (SD) faecal calprotectin in CF (94.3 [100.6] mg/kg) was greater than HC
      (26.7 [15.4] mg/kg, P < 0.0001), but lower than CD (2133 [2781] mg/kg, P =
      0.0003). Abnormal faecal calprotectin was found in subjects only with PI (17/22
      (77%), P = 0.001). There was no difference in faecal mean (SD) S100A12 (0.8 [0.9]
      vs 1.5 [2.2] mg/kg, P = 0.14) and osteoprotegerin concentrations (72.7 [52.2] vs 
      62.5 [0.0] pg/mL, P = 0.2) between CF and HC. Patients with CD had significantly 
      elevated S100A12 and osteoprotegerin compared with CF and HC. Faecal calprotectin
      inversely correlated with both weight (r = -0.5, P = 0.003) and height z scores
      (r = -0.6, P = 0.002) in CF. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of intestinal inflammation 
      in CF is unique and distinct from inflammatory bowel disease, with elevated
      faecal calprotectin but normal faecal S100A12 and osteoprotegerin concentrations.
      The severity of intestinal inflammation, based on faecal calprotectin,
      significantly correlates with poor growth.

TI  - Efficacy of concomitant elemental diet therapy in scheduled infliximab therapy in
      patients with Crohn's disease to prevent loss of response.
PG  - 1382-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3493-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important
      clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED)
      therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy
      can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate
      the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in
      patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal
      CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients
      were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and
      the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the
      basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the
      physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy
      of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With
      the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient
      characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was
      significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled
      IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for
      small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and
      ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the
      non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in
      maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in
      order to prevent LOR.

TI  - Surgery in the age of biological treatment.
PG  - 121-7
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2014.972445 [doi]
AB  - Surgery for IBD is in constant evolution; it does not appear that the
      introduction of biologicals has had a major effect on the chance of a patient
      being operated on or not. Pouch surgery had its heydays in the 80s and 90s and
      has since then become less frequent, but the number of patients undergoing
      surgery still seem about the same from one year to the other. Likewise, there is 
      no substantial evidence that surgery for Crohn's disease is diminishing. There
      have been fears that patients on biological treatment have an increased risk of
      postoperative complications. The issue is not completely settled but it is likely
      that patients on biological treatment who come to surgery are those who do not
      benefit from biologicals. Thus, they are compromised in that they have an ongoing
      inflammation, are in bad nutritional state, and might have several other known
      risk factors for a complicated postoperative course. These factors and perhaps
      not the biologicals per se is what surgeons should consider. During the recent
      years, we have seen several new developments in IBD surgery; the ileorectal
      anastomosis is being used for ulcerative colitis and laparoscopic surgery usually
      resulting in a shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmetics. We have
      also seen the introduction of robotic surgery, single incision minimal invasive
      surgery, transanal minimal invasive surgery, and other approaches to minimize
      surgical trauma. Time will show which of these innovations patients will benefit 
      from.

TI  - Risk factors for Crohn's disease of the neo-small intestine in ulcerative colitis
      patients with total proctocolectomy and primary or secondary ileostomies.
PG  - 170-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: De novo Crohn's disease (CD) of the neo-small intestine in ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients after total proctocolectomy (TPC) is a new disease entity, 
      which may persist even after a secondary diverting permanent ileostomy for pouch 
      failure. We sought to compare outcomes of primary ileostomy (PI, i.e., stoma
      created after colectomy without trying of ileal pouch) and secondary ileostomy
      (SI, i.e., stoma created after pouch failure) and to evaluate factors associated 
      with the development of CD of the neo-small intestine proximal to ileostomy.
      METHODS: A total of 123 eligible patients were identified from our Pouch Center
      Registry (PI group, n = 57 and SI group, n = 66). Demographics, clinical features
      and outcomes (CD of theneo-small intestine, non-CD related strictures,
      requirement of CD-related medications use, ileostomy-associated hospitalization, 
      ileostomy failure with stoma revision/relocation, and shortgut syndrome) were
      compared. Step-wise logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS: The
      median follow-up for the whole cohort was 5.0 (2.0-12.0) years. Younger age at
      diagnosis and surgery, family history of IBD, toxic megacolon/fulminant colitis, 
      pre-diversion severe diarrhea, prediversion anti-TNF biological therapy,
      arthralgia/arthropathy and staged surgery were more common in the SI group (p <
      0.05). In multivariate analysis, the presence of SI [odds ratio (OR), 8.23; 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 2.43-27.85], family history of IBD (OR, 9.14; 95% CI,
      3.13-26.69), and pre-diversion of weight loss (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.23-11.21) were
      contributing factors for developing CD of the neo-small intestine. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD of the neo-small intestine in stoma patients was associated with the presence 
      of SI, family history of IBD, and pre-diversion poor nutrition status. Patients
      with secondary ileostomy due to pouch failure should be carefully monitored.
      Aggressive medical, endoscopic or surgical therapy may be needed in patients at
      risk, before permanent diversion.

TI  - Factors associated with durable response to infliximab in Crohn's disease 5 years
      and beyond: a multicenter international cohort.
PG  - 60-70
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) has been used for over a decade worldwide. Less is
      known about the natural history of IFX use beyond a few years and which patients 
      are more likely to sustain benefits. METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) 
      exposed to IFX from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Saint-Antoine
      Hospital, Paris, and the Swiss IBD Cohort Study were identified through
      retrospective and prospective data collection, complemented by chart abstraction 
      of electronic medical records. We compared long-term users of IFX (>5 yr of
      treatment, long-term users of infliximab [LTUI]), with non-LTUI patients to
      identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: We pooled data on 1014 patients with CD
      from 3 different databases, of whom 250 were defined as LTUI. The comparison
      group comprised 290 patients with CD who discontinued IFX: 48 primary
      nonresponses, 95 loss of responses, and 147 adverse events. Factors associated
      with LTUI were colonic involvements and an earlier age at the start of IFX. The
      prevalence of active smokers and obese patients differed markedly, but inversely,
      between American and European centers but did not impact outcome. The
      discontinuation rate was stable around 3% to 6%, each year from years 3 to 10.
      CONCLUSIONS: Young age at start of IFX and colonic CD are factors associated with
      a beneficial long-term use of IFX. After 5 years of IFX, there is still a 3% to
      5% discontinuation rate annually. Several factors associated with a good initial 
      response such as nonsmoker and shorter disease duration at IFX initiation do not 
      seem associated with a longer term response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on
      recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the
      major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and
      assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive 
      IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary
      centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA
      anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95,
      99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%.
      IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a
      specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or
      IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA 
      anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease
      onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive
      disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more
      likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms
      the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with 
      disease severity phenotypes.

      related to treatment or IBD-associated liver diseases. Distinguishing benign from
      pathologic ELE is crucial for focused diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
      We sought to characterize the incidence, character, chronicity, degree, and
      etiology of ELE in children with IBD. METHODS: Institutional review
      board-approved retrospective review of all of the patients with IBD (2-21 years) 
      seen between October 2009 and October 2012 with >9 months of follow-up were
      included in the study. We examined body mass index, disease activity, extent,
      phenotype, concurrent medications, and character, chronicity, degree of enzyme
      elevation, and final diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 219 of 514 patients with IBD 
      had >/=1 episode of ELE. Five patients were excluded for preexisting liver
      disease, leaving 214 patients (Crohn disease [CD]: 14.8 +/- 3.5 years, 46% girls;
      ulcerative colitis [UC]: 14.4 +/- 4.2 years, 37% girls). One hundred forty-eight 
      patients (69%) had a hepatic, 17 (8%) cholestatic, and 49 (23%) mixed character
      of ELE. There were no significant differences in character, chronicity, or degree
      of ELE between CD and UC (P = 0.71, P = 0.58, P > 0.33). Of the 128 patients with
      sufficient data to determine chronicity, 98 (77%) had transient elevations, (CD: 
      n = 66, 75% and UC: n = 32, 80%). Episodes of ELE were idiopathic in 87% of
      patients with IBD. A final diagnosis of idiopathic ELE was associated with a
      lower degree of ELE elevation (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with 
      IBD commonly experience transient, idiopathic ELE. Our findings suggest that
      higher degrees of ELE, specifically alanine aminotransferase, are associated with
      an etiology that requires more extensive evaluation.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

TI  - Immunochip analysis identification of 6 additional susceptibility loci for
      Crohn's disease in Koreans.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000268 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is an intractable inflammatory bowel disease of 
      unknown cause. Recent genome-wide association studies of CD in Korean and
      Japanese populations suggested marginal sharing of susceptibility loci between
      Caucasian and Asian populations. As the 7 identified loci altogether explain
      5.31% of the risk for CD, the objective of this study was to identify additional 
      CD susceptibility loci in the Korean population. METHODS: Using the ImmunoChip
      custom single-nucleotide polymorphism array designed for dense genotyping of 186 
      loci identified through GWAS, we analyzed 722 individuals with CD and 461
      controls for 96,048 SNP markers in the discovery stage, followed by validation in
      an additional 948 affected individuals and 977 controls. RESULTS: We confirmed 6 
      previously reported loci in Caucasian: GPR35 at 2q37 (rs3749172; P = 5.30 x 10,
      odds ratio [OR] = 1.45), ZNF365 at 10q21 (rs224143; P = 2.20 x 10, OR = 1.38),
      ZMIZ1 at 10q22 (rs1250569; P = 3.05 x 10, OR = 1.30), NKX2-3 at 10q24 (rs4409764;
      P = 7.93 x 10, OR = 1.32), PTPN2 at 18p11 (rs514000; P = 9.00 x 10, OR = 1.33),
      and USP25 at 21q11 (rs2823256; P = 2.49 x 10, OR = 1.35), bringing the number of 
      known CD loci (including 3 in the HLA) in Koreans to 15. The 6 additional loci
      increased the total genetic variance for CD risk from 5.31% to 7.27% in Koreans. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the different genetic backgrounds of CD between Asian and
      Western countries has been well established for the major susceptibility genes,
      our findings of overlapping associations offer new insights into the genetic
      architecture of CD.

AB  - We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to 
      examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort
      study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative
      colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on
      demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We
      used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers,
      controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among
      centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio
      [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis 
      factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of
      immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor
      therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of
      evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce
      variation and improve outcomes.

      intervention at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2002 and 2013. RESULTS:
      Twenty-six patients underwent ileocecetomy (mean age at diagnosis 14.1 +/- 2.6
      years; mean age at resection 15.7 +/- 2.5 years; median follow-up 2 +/- 1.5
      years). Twenty-two (84.6%) patients reported clinical improvement and 17 (65.4%) 
      were able to decrease the number or dosage of medications. Average weight
      increased from the 29th to the 45th percentile (P = .09) at 1 year and to the
      56th percentile (P = .02) at 3 years post resection. Average body mass index
      increased from the 30th to the 48th and 49th percentile at 1 and 3 years (P < .05
      for both), respectively. Height increased from the 39th percentile at the time of
      resection to the 51st percentile at 3 years (P = nonsignificant). CONCLUSION:
      Surgical resection of an isolated ileal segment in adolescents with CD allows for
      catch-up growth and reduction in medication requirements.

TI  - Efficacy of oral methotrexate in paediatric Crohn's disease: a multicentre
      propensity score study.
PG  - 1898-904
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307964 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral methotrexate (MTX) administration avoids weekly injections,
      reduces costs and may improve quality of life of patients with Crohn's disease
      (CD), especially children. Routes of administration have never been
      systematically compared in CD. We aimed to compare effectiveness and safety of
      orally (PO) versus subcutaneously (SC) administered MTX in paediatric CD.
      METHODS: 226 children with CD treated with oral or subcutaneous MTX were included
      in a multicentre, retrospective 1-year cohort study (62% boys, mean age
      13.8+/-2.8 years, 88% previous thiopurines). 38 (17%) were initially commenced on
      oral, 98 (43%) started subcutaneous and switched to oral and 90 (40%) were
      treated with subcutaneous only. Matching and 'doubly robust' weighted regression 
      models were based on the propensity score method, controlling for
      confounding-by-indication bias. 11/23 pretreatment variables were different
      between the groups, but the propensity score modelling successfully balanced the 
      treatment groups. RESULTS: 76 children (34%) had sustained steroid-free remission
      with a difference that did not reach significance between the PO and the SC
      groups (weighted OR=1.72 (95% CI 0.5 to 5.9); p=0.52). There were no differences 
      in need for treatment escalation (p=0.24), elevated liver enzymes (p=0.59) or
      nausea (p=0.85). Height velocity was lower in the PO group (p=0.006) and time to 
      remission was delayed in the PO group (p=0.036; Fleming (0, 1) test).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this largest paediatric CD cohort to date, SC administered MTX
      was superior to PO, but only in some of the outcomes and with a modest effect
      size. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider switching children in complete 
      remission treated with subcutaneous MTX to the oral route with close monitoring
      of inflammatory markers and growth.

TI  - Systematic review with meta-analysis: magnetic resonance enterography signs for
      the detection of inflammation and intestinal damage in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 153-66
LID - 10.1111/apt.13024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), mucosal healing has become 
      a major goal, with the hope of avoiding intestinal damage from chronic
      inflammation. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has emerged as a non-invasive
      means of monitoring inflammation and damage. AIMS: As part of the development of 
      MRE-based multi-item measures of inflammation and damage for paediatric studies, 
      we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify MRE variables
      used to describe these two distinct concepts. METHODS: 2501 studies of MRI and CD
      were identified. Studies written in any language reporting individual MRE signs
      for patients diagnosed with CD were included. Two-hundred-and-forty-four studies 
      were fully reviewed and 62 were included (inflammation, n = 51; damage, n = 24). 
      Sensitivity, specificity and associated confidence intervals were calculated, and
      hierarchical summary ROC curves were constructed for each MRE sign. RESULTS: A
      total of 22 MRE signs were used to reflect inflammation, and 9 to reflect damage.
      Diagnostic accuracy of MRE signs of inflammation and damage was heterogeneous;
      however, wall enhancement, mucosal lesions and wall T2 hyperintensity were the
      most consistently useful for inflammation (most sensitivities >80% and
      specificities >90%), and detection of abscess and fistula were most consistently 
      useful for damage (most sensitivities >90%, specificities >95%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Identifying the best MRE variables to reflect inflammation and damage will
      maximise the utility of this rapidly emerging technique and is the first stage of
      constructing MRE-based indices for evaluating inflammation and intestinal damage.

TI  - Prebiotics and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease in children.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0067 [doi]
AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

TI  - Clinical features of interleukin 10 receptor gene mutations in children with very
      early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 332-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000621 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we studied a cohort of patients with very early
      onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to determine the frequency of mutations in
      the interleukin 10 (IL10) receptor genes as a cause of early-onset IBD. METHODS: 
      Sanger sequencing was performed to determine the presence of IL10 and/or IL10
      receptor mutations in 17 patients with a diagnosis of very early onset IBD
      (disease onset <2 years of age in 15 patients, between 3 and 4 years in the other
      2). Mutation screening was performed including all of the coding regions of the
      IL10, IL10RA, and IL10RB genes. We then compared the follow-up findings of the
      patients with IL10 receptor mutations in terms of demographic, clinical,
      laboratory, and treatment response properties with those of patients diagnosed as
      having very early onset IBD with no mutation. RESULTS: We identified 3 patients
      bearing mutations in the IL10 or IL10 receptor genes, including 1 mutation in
      IL10RB that has been described recently (c.G477A, p.Trp159*) and 2 novel
      mutations affecting the IL10RA gene (c.T192G, p.Tyr64 and c.T133G, p.Trp45Gly).
      Collectively, these mutations thus provided genetic etiology for 17.6% of the
      cohort under investigation. The presence of a family history of IBD and the
      clinical course of Crohn disease differed between patients with mutations in the 
      IL-10 pathway and those without such mutations. Although perianal fistulas were
      found in all of the patients with IL10 receptor mutations, they were found in
      only 14.3% of those without such mutations. The lower values of weight-for-age
      and height-for-age z scores, necessity for more intensive therapy, achievement of
      longer periods until remission, and frequent relapses in the patients bearing
      mutations in the IL10 receptor genes all underlined the severity of the disease
      and its relatively poor response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the small
      number of patients with mutations affecting the IL-10 signaling pathway in our
      study, in all of the patients with IL10 receptor mutations, the disease onset
      occurs at an early age, the prognosis is poor, and the response to treatment is
      insufficient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with
      intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies
      revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our
      understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We
      performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe
      autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and
      non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function.
      RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a
      coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell
      activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily
      highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein 
      folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4
      dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in
      carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical
      presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and 
      intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell
      proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of
      memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that variants in CTLA4
      provide the basis for a novel Mendelian form of early-onset CD associated with
      systemic autoimmunity. Incomplete penetrance of autoimmunity further indicates
      the presence of other genetic and/or environmental modifiers.

TI  - What role do bacteria play in persisting fistula formation in idiopathic and
      Crohn's anal fistula?
PG  - 235-41
LID - 10.1111/codi.12810 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aetiology of Crohn's disease-related anal fistula remains obscure.
      Microbiological, genetic and immunological factors are thought to play a role but
      are not well understood. The microbiota within anal fistula tracts has never been
      examined using molecular techniques. The present study aimed to characterize the 
      microbiota in the tracts of patients with Crohn's and idiopathic anal fistula.
      METHOD: Samples from the fistula tract and rectum of patients with Crohn's and
      idiopathic anal fistula were analysed using fluorescent in situ hybridization,
      Gram staining and scanning electron microscopy were performed to identify and
      quantify the bacteria present. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, including 20 with
      Crohn's anal fistula, 18 with idiopathic anal fistula and 13 with luminal Crohn's
      disease and no anal fistula, were recruited. Bacteria were not found in close
      association with the luminal surface of any of the anal fistula tracts.
      CONCLUSION: Anal fistula tracts generally do not harbour high levels of
      mucosa-associated microbiota. Crohn's anal fistulas do not seem to harbour
      specific bacteria. Alternative explanations for the persistence of anal fistula
      are needed.

TI  - PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway as a target for Crohn's disease therapy (Review).
PG  - 10-6
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1981 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, 
      is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong 
      genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive
      mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut
      microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation 
      processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN
      pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's
      disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a
      wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of
      diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the
      subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive
      research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular
      assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - A preoperative low nutritional prognostic index correlates with the incidence of 
      incisional surgical site infections after bowel resection in patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1366-72
LID - 10.1007/s00595-014-1044-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of incisional surgical site infections (SSIs) is reported 
      to be higher among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than among those with
      colorectal cancer. It has also been reported that the preoperative nutritional
      and inflammatory status is associated with the frequency of postoperative
      complications. Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) is a simple and
      useful parameter for determining the nutritional and inflammatory status. In the 
      present study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between the OPNI
      and the incidence of incisional SSI in patients with CD who had undergone bowel
      resection. METHODS: A total of 177 CD patients who underwent abdominal surgery
      were enrolled. Various clinical factors and the OPNI values were evaluated to
      identify risk factors for incisional SSIs. RESULTS: The incidence of incisional
      SSIs was 19.8 %. A multivariate analysis indicated that the OPNI was an
      independent risk factor for incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
      retrospective study suggest that the OPNI is an independent risk factor for
      incisional SSIs in patients with a history of bowel resection for CD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Under both physiological and pathological conditions, bone volume is
      determined by the rate of bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by
      osteoclasts. Excessive bone loss is a common complication of human IBD whose
      mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Despite the role of activated
      CD4(+) T cells in inflammatory bone loss, the nature of the T cell subsets
      involved in this process in vivo remains unknown. The aim of the present study
      was to identify the CD4(+) T cell subsets involved in the process of
      osteoclastogenesis in vivo, as well as their mechanism of action. DESIGN: CD4(+) 
      T cells were studied in IL10-/- mice and Rag1-/- mice adoptively transferred with
      naive CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells, representing two well-characterised animal
      models of IBD and in patients with Crohn's disease. They were phenotypically and 
      functionally characterised by flow cytometric and gene expression analysis, as
      well as in in vitro cocultures with osteoclast precursors. RESULTS: In mice, we
      identified bone marrow (BM) CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin (IL)-17 and
      tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as an osteoclastogenic T cell subset referred 
      to as Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells. During chronic inflammation, these cells migrate
      to the BM where they survive in an IL-7-dependent manner and where they promote
      the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, the main osteoclast progenitors. A
      population equivalent to the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells was also detected in
      patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the
      osteoclastogenic function of the Th17 TNF-alpha(+) cells that contribute to bone 
      loss in vivo in IBD.

PG  - 205-10
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000589 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adalimumab, a humanised anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody, is an
      effective treatment in adult patients with refractory Crohn disease (CD). The
      available literature on its efficacy in children remains limited. We aimed to
      evaluate the real-world efficacy in paediatric patients with CD and compare the
      efficacy between infliximab (IFX) nonresponders and patients who lost response to
      IFX. METHODS: All Dutch patients with CD receiving adalimumab before the age of
      18 years after previous IFX therapy were identified. We analysed longitudinal
      disease activity, assessed by the mathematically weighted Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) or the physician global assessment (PGA), and
      adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with CD were included. Twelve
      patients received monotherapy and the others received combination treatment with 
      thiopurines (n = 21), methotrexate (n = 11), steroids (n = 7), or exclusive
      enteral nutrition (n = 2). Median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range
      5-23). Remission was reached in 34 patients (64%, wPCDAI < 12.5 or PGA = 0) after
      a median of 3.3 months, and maintained by 50% for 2 years. Eleven patients (21%) 
      reached response but not remission (decrease in wPCDAI >/= 17.5 or decrease in
      PGA). Eighteen patients (34%) failed adalimumab treatment because of nonresponse 
      (n = 4), lost response (n = 11), or AEs (n = 3). More IFX nonresponders failed
      adalimumab treatment than patients who lost response to IFX (2/3 vs 8/34, hazard 
      ratio 18.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-303.6). Only 1 patient encountered a
      serious AE, a severe but nonfatal infection. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice,
      adalimumab induces remission in two-thirds of children with IFX refractory CD.

TI  - Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy may improve depressive symptoms in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 465-70
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3375-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of
      depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications.
      METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on
      immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or
      immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease
      activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple 
      Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were
      obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS:
      Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease
      symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140
      days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients
      started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased
      PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant 
      decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP
      were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 
      9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to
      severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease
      51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores
      decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive
      therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved
      significantly.

TI  - The ATG16L1-T300A allele impairs clearance of pathosymbionts in the inflamed
      ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 1546-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307289 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic,
      microbial and environmental factors. ATG16L1 is an important genetic factor
      involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial
      components from the gut. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the
      composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of CD patients in relation to the
      ATG16L1 risk status. DESIGN: Biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and
      non-inflamed regions of the terminal ileum of 11 CD patients homozygous for the
      ATG16L1 risk allele (ATG16L1-T300A) and 9 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 
      protective allele (ATG16L1-T300). Biopsy DNA was extracted and the bacterial
      composition analysed by pyrosequencing. Intracellular survival rates of
      adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) were analysed by determining colony
      forming units after exposure to monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers
      homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk or protective allele. RESULTS: Inflamed ileal
      tissue from patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele contained increased
      numbers of Fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal tissue of patients homozygous
      for the ATG16L1 protective allele showed decreased numbers of Bacteroidaceae and 
      Enterobacteriaceae and increased Lachnospiraceae. The ATG16L1 allele did not
      affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed ileal tissue. Monocytes
      homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele showed impaired killing of AIEC under
      inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective
      allele. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele
      show impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that
      ATG16L1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon
      inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a need for a scoring system that provides a
      comprehensive assessment of structural bowel damage, including stricturing
      lesions, penetrating lesions, and surgical resection, for measuring disease
      progression. We developed the Lemann Index and assessed its ability to measure
      cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, international, cross-sectional 
      study of patients with CD evaluated at 24 centers in 15 countries. Inclusions
      were stratified based on CD location and duration. All patients underwent
      clinical examination and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging analyses. Upper
      endoscopy, colonoscopy, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging analyses were
      performed according to suspected disease locations. The digestive tract was
      divided into 4 organs and subsequently into segments. For each segment,
      investigators collected information on previous operations, predefined
      strictures, and/or penetrating lesions of maximal severity (grades 1-3), and then
      provided damage evaluations ranging from 0.0 (no lesion) to 10.0 (complete
      resection). Overall level of organ damage was calculated from the average of
      segmental damage. Investigators provided a global damage evaluation (from 0.0 to 
      10.0) using calculated organ damage evaluations. Predicted organ indexes and
      Lemann Index were constructed using a multiple linear mixed model, showing the
      best fit with investigator organ and global damage evaluations, respectively. An 
      internal cross-validation was performed using bootstrap methods. RESULTS: Data
      from 138 patients (24, 115, 92, and 59 with upper tract, small bowel,
      colon/rectum, and anus CD location, respectively) were analyzed. According to
      validation, the unbiased correlation coefficients between predicted indexes and
      investigator damage evaluations were 0.85, 0.98, 0.90, 0.82 for upper tract,
      small bowel, colon/rectum, anus, respectively, and 0.84 overall. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      a cross-sectional study, we assessed the ability of the Lemann Index to measure
      cumulative structural bowel damage in patients with CD. Provided further
      successful validation and good sensitivity to change, the index should be used to
      evaluate progression of CD and efficacy of treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term effectiveness of enteral nutrition for maintaining
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is poorly documented. The aim of this
      study was therefore to examine the long-term effectiveness of enteral nutrition
      with aminosalicylates as maintenance therapy for those in whom remission was
      primarily induced by total parenteral nutrition or exclusive enteral nutrition
      with aminosalicylates. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data for 58 pediatric
      patients with newly diagnosed CD during a median follow-up period of 50 months
      (range, 12-216 months). Data for remission-induced patients in whom enteral
      nutrition with aminosalicylates was used as maintenance therapy were analyzed
      with particular reference to time to first relapse and time to first intestinal
      surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-five (43.1%) of the patients relapsed with a median
      duration of remission of 32.4 months (range, 6-73.2 months). The cumulative rates
      of continuous remission were 0.88 (95%CI: 0.79-0.96) at 1 year, 0.73 (95%CI:
      0.61-0.85) at 2 years, and 0.52 (95%CI: 0.35-0.68) at 5 years. None of the
      patients received corticosteroids, immunomodulators or anti-tumor necrosis factor
      agents until relapse. Disease location had no impact on timing of relapse, but
      with regard to disease behavior there was a trend towards earlier relapse in
      patients with penetrating type. Only six of the 58 patients (10.3%) needed
      intestinal surgery. There was a trend towards need for surgery in patients with
      ileal disease and with stricturing type. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition therapy
      with aminosalicylates is effective for maintaining remission and decreasing the
      rate of intestinal surgery in pediatric CD.

LID - 10.5009/gnl13345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To analyze the effect of short-term supportive temporary partial
      enteral nutrition therapy for treating severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label study in pediatric patients with 
      CD (n=78) from January 2007 to December 2011. The CD patients were divided into
      three groups according to disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe).
      Seventeen patients with severe CD received short-term partial enteral nutrition
      (SPEN) in addition to their general diet for 4 weeks after the induction of
      remission with medical treatment. This SPEN group was further divided into two
      groups by age (<13 years, >/=13 years). Nutritional parameters and Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores were analyzed at the initial enrollment and
      following 1 year of treatment for all groups. RESULTS: Nutritional status
      improved substantially after 1 year of treatment in the severe CD group.
      Nutritional status in the SPEN group improved considerably more than that in the 
      non-SPEN group. Additionally, the <13-year-old group demonstrated better
      nutritional status improvement than the >/=13-year-old group. CONCLUSIONS: SPEN
      may be effective in pediatric patients with severe CD for improving nutritional
      status and moderating disease severity.

TI  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children: an update for 2014.
PG  - 266-70
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12685 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian
      children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more
      often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in
      children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although 
      many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody
      diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short
      stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have
      altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and
      pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children
      presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic
      delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD
      encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child
      and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been to be more effective
      than corticosteroids in achieving mucosal healing without their side effects.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of EEN in terms of inducing clinical
      remission in newly diagnosed CD children and to study the efficacy of this
      therapeutic approach in improving the degree of intestinal mucosa inflammation.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with newly diagnosed
      Crohn's disease treated with EEN were reviewed retrospectively. The degree of
      mucosal inflammation was assessed by fecal calprotectin (FC). Remission was
      defined as a PCDAI<10. RESULTS: Forty patients (24 males) were included, the age 
      at diagnosis was 11.6 +/- 3.6 years. Of the 34 patients who completed the EEN
      period, 32 (94% per-protocol analysis) achieved clinical remission. This
      percentage fell to 80% in the intention-to-treat analysis. The compliance rate
      was 95%. Duration of EEN was 6.42 weeks (IQR 6.0-8.14). FC was significantly
      higher in patients with moderate and severe disease. Median baseline FC levels
      (680 mug/g) decreased significantly to 218 mug/g (P<0.0001) after EEN. We found a
      statistically significant correlation between FC and PCDAI (rho=0.727; P<0.0001).
      Early use of thiopurines (< 8 weeks) versus subsequent use was not associated
      with improved outcomes during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: EEN administered for
      6-8 weeks is effective for inducing clinical remission and decreasing the degree 
      of mucosal inflammation. We did not find differences in terms of maintenance of
      remission in patients treated early with thiopurines.

TI  - Impact of Disease Activity on Resting Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in 
      Adult Crohn's Disease: A Prospective Longitudinal Assessment.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during 
      phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been
      reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our
      aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy
      expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. 
      REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score,
      C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed.
      RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had
      increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 
      5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not
      sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active
      disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body 
      composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared 
      with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and
      behavior.
