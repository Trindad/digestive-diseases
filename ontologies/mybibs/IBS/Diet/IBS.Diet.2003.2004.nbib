TI  - Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in children.
PG  - 473-6
AB  - Jennifer, age 2 years, is being seen for her regular 2-year well child visit. You
      note her weight is only at the 5% and has been dropping percentiles over the past
      year When you ask her mother about Jennifer's diet, she reports Jennifer is a
      "picky eater" and often complains of a "stomach ache." Her mother reports her
      stomach looks "bloated. " Steven, age 7 years, is brought into the clinic because
      of recurrent abdominal pain with occasional constipation or diarrhea. Steven's
      mother had been told in the past that he probably had "irritable bowel syndrome" 
      but changes in his diet, occasional use of a laxative, and relaxation techniques 
      have not improved his symptoms. Rebecca, age 12 years, is brought into your
      clinic because her mother has recently learned that two first cousins have been
      diagnosed with celiac disease. She is wondering if Rebecca should be screened for
      this condition since she has heard it runs in families.

TI  - Colonic diverticular disease.
PG  - 983-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticular disease of the colon is common and the spectrum is
      broad, ranging from asymptomatic diverticulosis to perforation and massive
      haemorrhage requiring emergency colectomy. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the 
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, symptomatology and management of common
      presentations of diverticular disease including a brief review of surgical
      management. DISCUSSION: Management is based on the patient's symptoms and signs
      with assistance from findings at colonoscopy, computerised tomography scanning
      and occasionally bleeding localisation studies. For minimally symptomatic
      patients, a high fibre diet is the mainstay of management. Those with
      diverticulitis require antibiotics and bowel rest, and hospitalisation may be
      required. Surgery is indicated for recurrent diverticulitis, complicated
      diverticulitis, perforation and severe bleeding. This involves resection of the
      affected colon segment and can be performed laparoscopically or open.

TI  - Dietary fiber assessment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome from Northern 
      India.
PG  - 217-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the absolute fiber intake and the source of dietary fiber
      intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been lacking in
      northern Indians. OBJECTIVE: To find out the absolute fiber intake from different
      sources of food items in patients with IBS and healthy subjects from northern
      India. METHODS: Using the 72-hour recall method, dietary intake of macronutrients
      and fiber was determined in 33 consecutive adult patients with IBS and 33 age-
      and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The patients consumed lower amounts
      of macronutrients (protein 60.4 g vs 79.3 g, fat 47.7 g vs 65.7 g, and
      carbohydrates 294.6 g vs 339.8 g) and dietary fiber (8.1 g vs 15.7 g) than the
      control subjects. Though the patients consumed similar amount of pulses as the
      controls (46.6 [25.0] vs 46 [19.6] g/day), their fiber intake from pulses was
      lower (0.8 [0.7] vs 1.4 [0.9] g/day). The intake of fiber from vegetables and
      fruits was also significantly lower in patients (2.1 and 0.5 g/day, respectively)
      than in control subjects (5.8 and 3.9 g/day, respectively; p< 0.001 each).
      CONCLUSION: Total dietary fiber intake and intake of fiber from vegetables,
      fruits and pulses are lower in patients with IBS from northern India than in
      control subjects.

TI  - Meta-analysis: The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1253-69
AB  - To evaluate therapies available for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome,
      and provide consensus recommendations for their use, a total of 51 double-blind
      clinical trials using bulking agents, prokinetics, antispasmodics, alosetron,
      tegaserod and antidepressants were selected. The quality of studies was assessed 
      using 5-point scale. Meta-analyses were performed on all studies, and on
      'high-quality studies'. The efficacy of fibre in the global irritable bowel
      syndrome symptoms relief (OR: 1.9; 95% CI:1.5-2.4) was lost after exclusion of
      low-quality trials (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-2.0, P = 0.06). When excluding the
      low-quality trials, an improvement of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms
      with all antispasmodics (OR: 2.1; 95% CI:1.8-2.9) was maintained only for
      octylonium bromide, but on the basis of only two studies. Antidepressants were
      effective (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.9-3.5), even after exclusion of low-quality studies
      (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7). Alosetron (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9-2.6) and tegaserod
      (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.5) showed a significant effect in women. We recommend the
      use of tegaserod for women with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and
      alosetron for women with severe irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea.
      Antidepressants can be beneficial for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea
      patients with severe symptoms. Loperamide can be recommended in painless
      diarrhoea. Evidence is weak to recommend the use of bulking agents in the
      treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.

PG  - 48-54, 109
AB  - Chronic constipations in elderly people proved to be an important medical and
      social problem due to their high prevalence and serious complications caused by
      the very disease and administration of stimulating laxatives. They include as
      follows: anorectic incontinence, large intestine obstruction, stercoral ulcers,
      laxative dependence and bowels toxic affection (Cathartic colon). Morphological
      and physiological prerequisites of chronic constipation and anorectic
      incontinence occurrence are examined in this review. Drugs and tactics for
      monitoring constipations depending on their severity, dominance of transit and
      evacuation disturbances, occurrence of anorectic incontinence are described.
      Characteristics of laxatives and intestinal motility regulators, range of side
      effects as well as experience of their application in elderly patients with
      functional constipations and irritable bowel syndrome are presented.

TI  - Coeliac disease in Middle Eastern countries: a challenge for the evolutionary
      history of this complex disorder?
PG  - 694-7
AB  - About 10,000 years ago domestication and farming of wheat and other cereals
      developed in the 'Fertile Crescent', an area including modern Turkey, Iraq and
      Iran. Agriculture then slowly spread from Middle East to Europe. Coeliac disease 
      is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of
      wheat. It has been until relatively recently hypothesised that wheat consumption 
      exerted a negative selective pressure on genes predisposing to coeliac disease,
      eventually leading to higher coeliac disease frequency in Northeastern Europe
      because of lack of exposure to cereals. This theory is at variance with recent
      studies showing that coeliac disease is as common in Middle Eastern countries as 
      in Europe. High prevalence of coeliac disease has been found in Iran, in both the
      general population and at-risk groups, e.g. patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome or type 1 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of coeliac disease vary
      markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and the extent of disease.
      Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no
      symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat represented a major 
      component of the Iranian diet for many centuries and it may be argued that the
      continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree
      of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as
      irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. The
      gluten-free diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians in
      this area. This is particularly difficult in the absence of any supply for
      gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries.

TI  - Probiotics and medical nutrition therapy.
PG  - 56-68
AB  - Probiotics have been defined by The Food Agricultural Organization/World Health
      Organization (FAO/WHO) as "live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." They have been used for
      centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of
      probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal
      recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of
      English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship 
      between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been
      reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include
      diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune
      function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive,
      hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary
      tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further
      investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these
      medical conditions.

TI  - [Fasting and postprandial analysis of bowel sounds and plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine
      level].
PG  - 142-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Auscultation of bowel sounds is a traditional technique for
      evaluating patients with abdominal symptoms. It is, however, subjective and
      qualitative method in general. Recently, analysis of bowel sounds becomes
      possible. We analyzed bowel sounds in healthy volunteers and measured platelet
      depleted plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) that may be associated with
      postprandial symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: We recorded both
      fasting and postprandial bowel sounds for 30 minutes in 16 healthy volunteers
      with a sensitive electronic stethoscope attached to a digital recorder. The files
      were saved in computer as wav files and analyzed with a specialized program.
      Blood samples were also taken before and 1 hour after meal for 5-HT analysis.
      RESULTS: Meal challenge made no statistically significant changes in the 5-HT
      concentrations and all the sound parameters including sound to sound interval,
      sounds/minute, average of sound amplitudes, sound length, percentage of bowel
      sounds representing sound clustering and dominant frequency of sounds.
      CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial changes in bowel sounds and plasma 5-HT were
      insignificant in healthy Korean volunteers.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome in France: a common, debilitating and costly disorder.
PG  - 995-1001
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This epidemiological investigation aims to measure the prevalence of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the general population using the Rome II
      criteria and to evaluate the medical management including treatments and the
      impact of IBS on patient life. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of
      20,000 French subjects, aged 18 years and over, were interviewed by SOFRES
      (French Public Opinion Poll Institute) in May 2001. In a second phase (June/July 
      2001), a 48-question self-administered questionnaire was given to the subjects
      who have been selected during the first phase as suffering from IBS (Rome II
      criteria). RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 4.7% (confidence interval,
      4.36-5.04% with 5% risk) with a predominance in women (5.7% versus 3.7%, P <
      0.01). The abdominal pain was often longstanding (> 5 years, 50%), intense (43%) 
      and nocturnal (35%). During the most recent painful episode the levels of
      associated transit problems were almost equally divided between diarrhoea (36%), 
      constipation (29%) and alternate episodes of both (31%). Apart from pain,
      bloating was given as the most frequent (73%) and most troublesome (24%) symptom.
      Since the onset, 80% of subjects with IBS had consulted a doctor (90% consulted a
      general physician, 57% a gastroenterologist, 50% both) and of these, 80%
      consulted within the previous 12 months. Sixty-seven per cent of subjects
      underwent additional investigations since the start of their illness (average of 
      3.4 examinations per patient examined: colonoscopy, 34.1%; laboratory tests, 34%;
      and abdominal ultrasound, 27.7%). Over the previous 12 months, 8% of the subjects
      had been admitted to hospital (average length of stay, 6.6 days), 11% of employed
      subjects had to take time off, 93% of subjects had taken prescribed medication
      (87%), but 43% of people thought it was ineffective. The effect on daily life was
      considerable (score, 6.2/10; close to the score for flu, 7/10). Two-thirds of the
      individuals changed their diet; 54% said it affected their social life and 29%
      their professional life. Seventy-four per cent of patients trusted their doctor, 
      with a satisfaction index of 63%, but 45% of patients would like to have more
      information on IBS. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the Rome II criteria
      detected IBS with a prevalence of 4.7%. The recruited subjects had severe
      symptoms (frequency, intensity and duration) that had a considerable effect on
      their daily life. The high level of referrals and initial consultations in all
      categories and the patient's attitudes towards the illness and its treatment
      emphasize the relative ineffectiveness of care for patients suffering from IBS.

TI  - Food elimination based on IgG antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome: a
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1459-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often feel they have
      some form of dietary intolerance and frequently try exclusion diets. Tests
      attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing but none
      has utilised IgG antibodies. AIMS: To assess the therapeutic potential of dietary
      elimination based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food. PATIENTS: A total of
      150 outpatients with IBS were randomised to receive, for three months, either a
      diet excluding all foods to which they had raised IgG antibodies (enzyme linked
      immunosorbant assay test) or a sham diet excluding the same number of foods but
      not those to which they had antibodies. METHODS: Primary outcome measures were
      change in IBS symptom severity and global rating scores. Non-colonic
      symptomatology, quality of life, and anxiety/depression were secondary outcomes. 
      Intention to treat analysis was undertaken using a generalised linear model.
      RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the true diet resulted in a 10% greater reduction in
      symptom score than the sham diet (mean difference 39 (95% confidence intervals
      (CI) 5-72); p = 0.024) with this value increasing to 26% in fully compliant
      patients (difference 98 (95% CI 52-144); p<0.001). Global rating also
      significantly improved in the true diet group as a whole (p = 0.048, NNT = 9) and
      even more in compliant patients (p = 0.006, NNT = 2.5). All other outcomes showed
      trends favouring the true diet. Relaxing the diet led to a 24% greater
      deterioration in symptoms in those on the true diet (difference 52 (95% CI
      18-88); p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be
      effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.

TI  - Effects of a high-fiber diet on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: a
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 735-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of dietary fiber on symptoms of irritable 
      bowel syndrome. METHODS: A single-blind randomized clinical trial was designed.
      Fifty-six subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were prospectively and randomly 
      assigned to one of two groups: group 1 received a diet containing 10.4 g/d of
      fiber and group 2 received a diet containing 30.5 g/d of fiber. Patients' body
      weights, nutritional intakes as assessed with 3-d written food records, and
      symptom scores were assessed at baseline and at 3 mo. RESULTS: There were no
      dropouts during the study. Total energy intake and the distribution of
      macronutrients were not significantly different between groups. Total dietary
      fiber intake did not reach recommended levels in either group but was higher in
      group 2 than in group 1 (25.95 +/- 2.12 g/d versus 6.06 +/- 2.7 g/d, P < 0.05).
      Initial fiber intake did not differ significantly between groups. Pain scores,
      bowel scores, and general scores improved in both groups (from baseline to 3 mo),
      and no significant differences were detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A
      modest fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome relieved symptoms, 
      but this therapeutic benefit of fiber may have been due to a placebo effect
      because the results were similar in the low-fiber group.

TI  - The burden of illness of irritable bowel syndrome: current challenges and hope
      for the future.
PG  - 299-309
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review unmet medical needs associated with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), to discuss factors that contribute to these unmet needs, and to
      provide an overview of advancements in IBS diagnosis and treatment options that
      may influence treatment strategies. SUMMARY: IBS is characterized by a multiple
      symptom complex of abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habits (i.e.,
      constipation, diarrhea, or both in alternation) and is associated with a large
      unmet medical need. IBS symptoms are chronic and bothersome, and they have a
      profound negative impact on patients. quality of life (i.e., affecting sleep,
      personal relationships, travel, diet, and sexual functioning). IBS imposes a
      substantial economic burden in direct medical costs and in indirect social costs 
      such as absenteeism from work and school and lost productivity, along with the
      less-measurable costs of a decreased quality of life. The annual cost of IBS
      treatment in the United States has been estimated to be between $1.7 billion and 
      $10 billion in direct medical costs (excluding prescription and over-the-counter 
      [OTC] drug costs) and $20 billion for indirect costs. The goals of IBS therapy
      are to provide global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS and to relieve
      single IBS symptoms. Although traditional IBS therapies (e.g., laxatives,
      antidepressants, antispasmodics, and bulking agents) are useful for some patients
      in relieving single IBS symptoms, patients generally are dissatisfied with their 
      overall efficacy and tolerability. These agents have not been proven in
      randomized, controlled clinical trials to be more effective than placebo in
      providing global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS. Over the past 2 decades,
      numerous advancements in the diagnosis and management of IBS have provided hope
      for the future, including research strides in our understanding of the underlying
      pathophysiology of IBS; new diagnostic and management recommendations based on a 
      stepwise, symptom-based approach; and the development of novel pharmacologic
      agents. CONCLUSION: IBS imposes a high socioeconomic burden on its sufferers and 
      on society. Research strides in the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder
      have enhanced our understanding of IBS, but many questions remain to be answered.
      Development of evidence-based guidelines on the stepwise, symptom-based approach 
      to IBS diagnosis and the continuing efforts to develop unique pharmacologic
      classes targeted at the multiple symptoms of this disorder are steps in the right
      direction. Though cost-effectiveness data on specific pharmacologic classes are
      not yet available, these ongoing efforts may help promote timely IBS diagnosis
      and patient satisfaction with care, optimally decreasing the use of health care
      resources.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain in
      children.
PG  - 584-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Apley, working in Bristol, UK, defined recurrent abdominal pain (RAP)
      in 1958. After extensive investigations, he found that 8% of children presenting 
      to his clinic with RAP had an organic pathology. The aims of this study were to
      identify (1) causes of RAP using modern methodology, (2) factors associated with 
      organic RAP and (3) children with non-organic RAP who fulfill the diagnostic
      criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Children, aged over 3 years,
      presenting with RAP were prospectively recruited to this study. They had a
      detailed questionnaire completed, a full examination with screening tests (blood 
      for coeliac screen, Helicobacter pylori antibody titre, inflammatory markers,
      serum amylase, liver function tests, and full blood count, urine and stool
      analyses and abdominal ultrasonography). Endoscopy and oesophageal pH monitoring 
      were performed if clinically indicated. IBS was diagnosed if the child had no
      organic pathology and fulfilled the Rome II criteria. Out of 103 children (median
      age of 10 years, mean 10.04, SD +/-3.44), 31 children (30%) had organic
      pathologies. Factors associated with organic pain were nocturnal symptoms
      (P<0.01) and abdominal tenderness (P<0.005) and with non-organic pain were
      periumbilical locality (P<0.002), pain alleviation on defaecation (P<0.04) and
      low fibre diet (P<0.005). Of children with non-organic pain, 37/52 (51%)
      fulfilled the criteria for IBS (36% of the total). CONCLUSION: Of children
      presenting with recurrent abdominal pain in a hospital setting, 30% have a
      diagnosable organic aetiology compared to 8% in Apley's time. Irritable bowel
      syndrome, however, may be the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain and
      should be considered.

TI  - The causes of intestinal dysbiosis: a review.
PG  - 180-97
AB  - Alterations in the bowel flora and its activities are now believed to be
      contributing factors to many chronic and degenerative diseases. Irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing
      spondylitis have all been linked to alterations in the intestinal microflora. The
      intestinal dysbiosis hypothesis suggests a number of factors associated with
      modern Western living have a detrimental impact on the microflora of the
      gastrointestinal tract. Factors such as antibiotics, psychological and physical
      stress, and certain dietary components have been found to contribute to
      intestinal dysbiosis. If these causes can be eliminated or at least attenuated
      then treatments aimed at manipulating the microflora may be more successful

TI  - Gynecologic and obstetric findings related to nutritional status and adherence to
      a gluten-free diet in Brazilian patients with celiac disease.
PG  - 567-74
AB  - This study shows a broad analysis of gynaecological and obstetrical disturbances 
      in patients with celiac disease in relation to their nutritional status and
      adherence to a gluten-free diet. Seventy-six adult celiac patients were analyzed 
      according to nutritional status and 18 children/adolescents to gluten-free diet
      adherence. As controls, 84 adults and 22 adolescents with irritable bowel
      syndrome were used The significant findings were observed as follow: adult celiac
      patients, irrespective of the nutritional status, were younger than controls,
      presented delayed menarche, secondary amenorrhea, a higher percentage of
      spontaneous abortions, anemia and hypoalbuminemia. No differences were observed
      regarding the number of pregnancies, age at menopause and duration of the
      reproductive period. After treatment, patients presented with normal pregnancies 
      and one patient presented spontaneous abortion. The adolescents who were not
      adherent to gluten-free diet presented delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhea.
      In conclusion, gluten per se could explain the disturbances and malnutrition
      would worsen the disease in a consequent vicious cycle. Therefore, celiac disease
      should be included in the screening of reproductive disorders.

TI  - Self-management for women with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 585-96
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A randomized clinical trial was used to test the effectiveness
      of an 8-session multicomponent program (Comprehensive) compared to a Brief
      (single session) version and Usual Care for women with irritable bowel syndrome. 
      METHODS: Menstruating women, ages 18-48 years, were recruited from a health
      maintenance organization as well as community advertisements. Psychiatric nurse
      practitioners delivered both programs. The primary outcomes were improved
      symptoms, psychological distress, health-related quality of life, and indicators 
      of stress-related hormones. Outcome indicators were measured at 3 points: (1)
      immediately after the Comprehensive program or 9 weeks after entry into the Usual
      Care and Brief Self-Management groups, (2) at 6 months, and (3) at 12 months.
      RESULTS: Compared to Usual Care, women in the Comprehensive program had reduced
      gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological distress indicators, interruptions in
      activities because of symptoms, and enhanced quality of life that persisted at
      the 12-month follow-up evaluation. Women in the Brief group also demonstrated
      statistically significant improvements in quality of life and smaller
      nonsignificant improvements in other outcome variables than observed in the
      Comprehensive group. There were no group differences in urine catecholamines and 
      cortisol levels. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive self-management program is an
      important therapy approach for women with irritable bowel syndrome. The Brief
      1-session version is also moderately helpful for some women with IBS.

TI  - Effects of multidisciplinary education on outcomes in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 576-84
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The impact of education on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is
      not well known. This study evaluated the effect of a onetime group education
      program on patient-based outcomes in IBS. METHODS: All adults referred by Mayo
      Clinic physicians to the Gastroenterology Division with a diagnosis of IBS
      between May 1997 and March 1998 were asked to participate. Questionnaires were
      administered at baseline and 6 months. Symptom resolution, change in pain
      severity, quality of life, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile score, overall
      patient satisfaction, and health care utilization were compared among those
      patients who attended the multidisciplinary class and those who did not. RESULTS:
      Of the 506 patients approached, 403 (80%) agreed to participate. The clinical
      diagnosis was confirmed in 344 patients (85%) on chart review; 211 patients (61%)
      subsequently completed a follow-up questionnaire. Overall, 29% of class attendees
      who met Rome criteria for IBS at baseline no longer met Rome criteria at
      follow-up, compared with 7% of nonattendees. By multivariate analysis, class
      attendance predicted higher odds of not meeting Rome criteria at follow-up in
      individuals meeting Rome criteria at baseline (odds ratio, 7.91; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.97-64.41) than in nonattendees, but the opposite effect was seen with
      class attendance in those not meeting Rome criteria at baseline. This interaction
      between baseline Rome status and class attendance was significant (P < 0.05).
      Class attendance was associated with improvement in Health-Promoting Lifestyle
      Profile scores (P < 0.05) but not with change in pain, quality of life,
      satisfaction, or health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: A onetime,
      multidisciplinary class for patients with IBS was associated with improvement in 
      symptoms and health-promoting lifestyle behavior.

TI  - Management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 353-9
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. The prevalence rate is 10-20% and women have a higher
      prevalence. IBS adversely affects quality of life and is associated with health
      care use and costs. IBS comprises a group of functional bowel disorders in which 
      abdominal discomfort or pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel
      habit, and with features of disordered defecation. The consensus definition and
      criteria for IBS have been formalized in the "Rome II criteria". Food,
      psychiatric disorders, and gastroenteritis are risk factors for developing IBS.
      The mechanism in IBS involves biopsychosocial disorders; psychosocial factors,
      altered motility, and heightened sensory function. Brain-gut interaction is the
      most important in understanding the pathophysiology of IBS. Effective management 
      requires an effective physician-patient relationship. Dietary treatment,
      lifestyle therapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapy play a major
      role in treating IBS. Calcium polycarbophil can benefit IBS patients with
      constipation or alternating diarrhea and constipation.

TI  - Testing for celiac sprue in irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea: a
      cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1721-32
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS-D) may have undiagnosed celiac sprue (CS). Because the symptoms of 
      CS respond to a gluten-free diet, testing for CS in IBS may prevent years of
      morbidity and attendant expense. We sought to determine whether this might be a
      cost-effective diagnostic strategy in IBS-D. METHODS: We used decision analysis
      to calculate the cost-effectiveness of 2 competing strategies in IBS-D: (1) start
      empirical IBS treatment and (2) perform serologic test for CS followed by
      endoscopic biopsy for positive tests. The base-case cohort had a CS prevalence of
      3.4%, which was varied between 0% and 100% in sensitivity analysis. The outcome
      measure was cost per symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Under base-case
      conditions, testing for CS instead of starting empiric IBS therapy cost an
      incremental $11,000 to achieve one additional symptomatic improvement. Testing
      for CS became the dominant strategy when the prevalence of CS exceeded 8%, the
      specificity of CS testing exceeded 98%, or the cost of IBS therapy exceeded
      $130/month. The incremental cost-effectiveness of testing for CS exceeded $50,000
      when the prevalence fell below 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for CS in patients with
      IBS-D has an acceptable cost when the prevalence of CS is above 1% and is the
      dominant strategy when the prevalence exceeds 8%. The decision to test should be 
      based on a consideration of the population prevalence of underlying CS, the
      operating characteristics of the screening test employed, and the cost of
      proposed therapy for IBS.

TI  - Serological testing for coeliac disease in patients with symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1199-210
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome may have coeliac
      disease. AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of coeliac disease testing in
      suspected irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: We used decision analysis to
      estimate the number of coeliac disease cases detected, quality-adjusted
      life-years gained, and costs resulting from testing suspected irritable bowel
      syndrome patients for tissue transglutaminase antibody or an antibody panel
      (tissue transglutaminase, gliadin, total immunoglobulin A). Positive tests
      prompted endoscopic biopsy. A gluten-free diet improved quality of life in
      coeliac disease. RESULTS: Assuming a coeliac disease prevalence of 3%, tissue
      transglutaminase detected 28 and the panel detected 29 of 30 coeliac disease
      cases among 1000 suspected irritable bowel syndrome patients. The cost/case
      detected was $4600 with tissue transglutaminase and $8800 with the panel. The
      cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained with tissue transglutaminase was $7400,
      and the incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained for the panel vs.
      tissue transglutaminase was $287 000. Tissue transglutaminase cost under $100
      000/quality-adjusted life-year gained at a coeliac disease prevalence >/=1.1%,
      assuming a modest utility gain of 0.005 with coeliac disease diagnosis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Testing for coeliac disease in patients with suspected irritable
      bowel syndrome is likely to be cost-effective even at a relatively low coeliac
      disease prevalence and with small improvements in quality of life with a
      gluten-free diet.

TI  - Coeliac disease: the great imitator.
PG  - 524-6
AB  - Coeliac disease (CD) is caused by a complex immunological response provoked by
      grain protein in susceptible people. The majority of people with CD are
      symptom-free adults; the remainder are prone to a bewildering variety of signs
      and symptoms, ranging from infertility to type 1 diabetes. Many patients with
      undiagnosed CD spend years seeking help for complaints such as chronic tiredness 
      or mild abdominal symptoms. In primary care, an appropriate target group to test 
      for CD is people with anaemia (especially women), chronic tiredness, non-specific
      abdominal symptoms (including so-called "irritable bowel syndrome"), or a family 
      history of CD. The response to an appropriate gluten-free diet is often
      life-transforming for symptomatic patients. Positive serological tests for CD
      require confirmation by duodenal biopsy and, if confirmed, referral to a
      dietitian and a coeliac society, followed by a life-long gluten-free diet.

TI  - Paroxetine to treat irritable bowel syndrome not responding to high-fiber diet: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 914-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the trial was to determine whether a high-fiber diet
      (HFD) alone or in combination with paroxetine or placebo was effective treatment 
      for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: DESIGN: Trial of HFD
      alone (Group 1) followed by a randomized, double-blind trial of HFD with
      paroxetine or placebo (Group 2). SETTING: Gastroenterology office in a 524-bed
      university-affiliated community hospital in Pittsburgh. PATIENTS: Men and women, 
      aged 18-65 yr, previously diagnosed with IBS but otherwise healthy. INTERVENTION:
      Institution of HFD in 98 participants consuming low- or average-fiber diets.
      Allocation of paroxetine to 38 and placebo to 43 symptomatic participants
      consuming HFDs. MEASUREMENTS: Overall well-being, abdominal pain, and abdominal
      bloating (Groups 1 and 2); food avoidance, work functioning, and social
      functioning (Group 2). RESULTS: In Group 1, overall well-being improved in 26%
      patients, and abdominal pain and bloating decreased in 22% and 26% patients,
      respectively, with an HFD. In Group 2, overall well-being improved more with
      paroxetine than with placebo (63.3%vs 26.3%; p= 0.01), but abdominal pain,
      bloating, and social functioning did not. With paroxetine, food avoidance
      decreased (p= 0.03) and work functioning was marginally better (p= 0.08). Before 
      unblinding, more paroxetine recipients than placebo recipients wanted to continue
      their study medication (84%vs 37%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in
      overall well-being found in our paroxetine/placebo trial is greater than that
      found in previously published drug/placebo trials for IBS. Moreover, the
      difference in well-being applied to nondepressed recipients of paroxetine.

TI  - Alternative approach to IBS and migraine is winning over providers.
PG  - 6-10, 1
AB  - Many clinicians have long suspected that symptoms of IBS are somehow related to
      diet. In fact, research conducted over many years in Europe suggests than many
      cases of IBS are, in fact, the result of inflammatory reactions to specific foods
      or ingredients. Further, some cases of migraine appear to be linked to food
      intolerances as well. Now, a company in Florida has developed a DM program that
      can pinpoint specific cases of food intolerance and create an individualized
      program for eliminating symptoms.

TI  - Relationship of bloating to other GI and menstrual symptoms in women with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 88-95
AB  - This report examines the relationships between bloating and other symptoms in
      young women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), using both retrospective and
      daily diary measures of symptoms. Of the 195 IBS women, 147 (75%) reported
      retrospectively that they often feel bloated and distended. Across-women analyses
      of both retrospective and daily diary data show that bloating is most strongly
      associated with constipation, abdominal pain, and intestinal gas. Within-woman
      analyses of daily symptoms also show a strong association of bloating with
      abdominal pain and intestinal gas (i.e., abdominal pain and intestinal gas are
      higher on days when bloating is higher) but only a weak association with
      constipation. Bloating is strongly associated with uterine cramping and breast
      tenderness, but only when perimenses days are included in the analysis. In
      conclusion, bloating is a very common symptom in women with IBS that is most
      strongly related to abdominal pain and intestinal gas but may be confounded with 
      menses-associated symptoms.

TI  - Systematic review: the role of different types of fibre in the treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a
      bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of
      irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may
      have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal
      transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in
      several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre
      in irritable bowel syndrome management. AIM: To quantify the effect of different 
      types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome.
      METHODS: Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected
      randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated 
      with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using
      soluble and insoluble fibre separately. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included 
      in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome
      patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable
      bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive
      benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there 
      was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in
      irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different 
      effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium,
      ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 
      1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some
      cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference
      compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for
      global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel
      syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different
      effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases,
      insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies
      evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary
      care.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence in city center of Sivas.
PG  - 128-31
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We planned to determine irritable bowel syndrome prevalence in
      our region with its distribution according to clinical characteristics of
      patients and the factors which are considered to be related with irritable bowel 
      syndrome. METHODS: 998 of 1250 individuals (mean age 38.99+0.44) replied to our
      questionnaire including Rome II criteria. RESULTS: We found the irritable bowel
      syndrome prevalence in the city center of Sivas to be 19.1%. Distribution of
      irritable bowel syndrome (+) patients age groups showed no significant difference
      but irritable bowel syndrome was significantly more common in females. The most
      common occupation showing irritable bowel syndrome positivity was workers.
      Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence was also significantly higher in persons not 
      eating three regular meals per day. There was a significantly positive
      correlation between irritable bowel syndrome prevalence and psychological events,
      previous abdominal operations and infections. A change in bowel habitus was
      observed in 41.8% of irritable bowel syndrome patients, and the most common
      change was constipation. 39.8% of the irritable bowel syndrome patients had
      applied to the doctor, most often to doctors of internal medicine. We found the
      irritable bowel syndrome prevalence not to be related with educational status,
      smoking, daily tea and coffee consumption, alcohol intake, menstrual periods or
      weight loss. CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence in our region with
      its demographic characteristics was similar to the results seen in western
      countries.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation training,
      and routine clinical care for the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 2209-18
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Psychological treatments are considered to be useful in the irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), although the evidence is based on small, often flawed
      trials. Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and relaxation therapy have
      both been promising, we hypothesized that CBT would be superior to relaxation and
      standard care alone in IBS patients. The objective of this study was to test this
      assumption by comparing the effects of cognitive behavior therapy with relaxation
      therapy and routine clinical care alone in individuals with IBS. METHODS:
      Patients (n = 105) with Rome I criteria for IBS were recruited from advertisement
      (n = 51) and outpatient clinics (n = 54); those patients with resistant IBS were 
      not included. A randomized controlled trial with three arms (standard care for
      all groups plus either CBT or relaxation) for 8 wk was conducted, which applied
      blinded outcome assessments using validated measures with 1 yr of follow-up. The 
      primary outcome for this study was bowel symptom severity. RESULTS: Of 105
      patients at the commencement of treatment, the mean bowel symptom frequency score
      for the whole sample was 21.1 and at the end of treatment had fallen to 18.1;
      this persisted at the 52-wk follow-up, with a significant linear trend for scores
      to change over time (F = 39.57 p < 0.001). However, there were no significant
      differences among the three treatment conditions. Significant changes over time
      were found for physical functioning (F = 4.37, p < 0.001), pain (F = 3.12, p <
      0.05), general health (F = 2.71, p < 0.05), vitality (F = 2.94, p < 0.05), and
      the social functioning scales on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (F =
      4.08, p < 0.05); however, all three arms showed similar improvement. There were
      significant reductions in anxiety, depression, and locus of control scales, but
      no significant differences among the treatment groups were detected. CONCLUSION: 
      Cognitive behavior and relaxation therapy seem not to be superior to standard
      care alone in IBS.

TI  - Review of the implications of dietary tryptophan intake in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome and psychiatric disorders.
PG  - 590-5
AB  - In this review, we address the possible role of the essential amino acid
      L-tryptophan or its metabolic derivative 5-hydroxytryptophan in the modulation of
      serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) synthesis and thereby in affecting the
      pathophysiology of central and peripheral nervous system disorders, including
      depression and irritable bowel syndrome. L-Tryptophan may represent a link
      between apparently disparate functional disorders and is of interest for general 
      gastroenterologists, neurogastroenterologists, and neurologists. On the basis of 
      estimates showing that approximately 20% of patients with functional bowel
      disorders seeking care in referral centres have psychiatric comorbidity, we
      attempt to provide a conceptual framework for defining the possible role of
      L-tryptophan in this population.

TI  - Role of alimentation in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 225-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different food items are made responsible for irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but the physiopathology of IBS remains unclear. AIMS:
      During a meeting in Nice, France, experts of the European Working Team of the
      IBiS Club discussed selected data regarding the relationships between
      alimentation, food items (including fibers) and IBS symptoms. METHODS/RESULTS:
      Food allergy remains a difficult diagnosis, but medical and general history,
      presence of general symptoms such as skin rash, and hypersensitivity tests may
      help in achieving a positive diagnosis. On the other hand, food intolerance is
      more confusing because of the subjectivity of the relationship between ingestion 
      of certain foods and the appearance of clinical symptoms. Different food items
      which are commonly implicated in adverse reactions mimicking IBS were found to be
      stimulants for the gut, suggesting that patients with predominant diarrhea IBS
      have to be carefully questioned about consumption of different kinds of food
      (i.e., coffee, alcohol, chewing gum, soft drinks) and not only on lactose
      ingestion. Gas production is discussed on the basis of retention of intestinal
      gas as well as on malabsorption of fermentable substrates. The role of a large
      amount of this kind of substrate reaching the colon is suggested as a potential
      mechanism of IBS-type symptoms in overeating patients. Regarding the role of
      fiber in IBS, the expert group concluded that fibers are not inert substances and
      that they could trigger pain or bloating in some IBS patients. CONCLUSION:
      Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general
      dietary advice to IBS patients, but dieteticians may have a positive role in
      managing such patients.

TI  - Effect of predominant methanogenic flora on the outcome of lactose breath test in
      irritable bowel syndrome patients.
PG  - 1116-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between hydrogen and methane production is a
      possible confounding factor in the interpretation of H(2) breath tests (HBT), but
      is usually disregarded for the interpretation of HBT and, in most instances, only
      H(2) excretion is measured. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect
      of predominant fasting methane CH(4) or H(2) production on the outcome of lactose
      HBT, in a large, homogeneous series of adult patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A lactose HBT was performed in 237 IBS
      patients with predominant fasting methane production (CH(4)>H(2)), recording the 
      outcome of the test, amount of gas excreted and occurrence of clinical symptoms. 
      Data were compared to those of 237 age- and sex-matched IBS patients with low
      fasting CH(4) excretion. RESULTS: The test was positive in 124 predominant CH(4) 
      producers (52.3%) (PMP), as compared to 201 (84.8%) low methane producers (LMP)
      (P<0.0001). Peak hydrogen concentration and area under the curve of H(2) were
      significantly (P<0.001) lower, and the occurrence of symptoms during the test
      less frequent, in PMP vs LMP patients. During the test, CH(4) excretion doubled
      in 57/113 (50.4%) patients with negative HBT, and in 49/124 (39.5%) with positive
      HBT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with predominant fasting methane production excrete
      less H(2) than LMP, after an oral load of lactose. The lower prevalence of severe
      lactose intolerance in PMP, as well as lower incidence of symptoms during the
      test, is, indeed, related to lower and slower H(2) excretion. The assumption that
      H(2) excretion is an effective means of quantifying the amount of malabsorbed
      carbohydrates is questionable in PMP. Methane-producing patients likely have a
      higher 'false negative' rate as compared to LMP after an oral load of lactose.
      Nonetheless, as symptoms are related to the amount of gas produced in the colon, 
      HBT identifies patients with 'lactose intolerance', irrespective of the presence 
      of lactose malabsorption, and helps in predicting the effect of
      lactose-restricted diet.

TI  - Recurrent abdominal pain in children: forerunner to adult irritable bowel
      syndrome?
PG  - 81-9
AB  - ISSUES AND PURPOSE: Review the etiology and pathophysiology of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) and its potential role as a precursor to irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Physiological mechanisms not easily
      identifiable as an organic cause may underlie symptoms in RAP patients. They may 
      be triggered by psychosocial factors that result in greater functional
      disability, more clinic visits, and lower academic and social competence. Of
      these children, 25% will experience similar symptoms as adults; many will be
      diagnosed with IBS. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses can provide early and efficient
      management of these children's care if they view the issues of abdominal
      pain/discomfort from a broader focus that includes the context of the child's
      experiences.

TI  - Coeliac disease presenting with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease may easily mimic symptoms which are parts of the
      criteria used for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To find the frequency
      of coeliac disease among patients diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS:
      During a period of one year, irritable bowel syndrome patients referred to a
      university clinic in Tehran were studied. For each patient, an asymptomatic
      sibling was enrolled as control. Serological tests for coeliac disease were
      performed in all patients and controls. If positive, duodenal biopsy was
      performed to confirm the diagnosis. Patients subsequently diagnosed as coeliac
      disease were placed on a gluten free diet and re-evaluated after 6 months.
      RESULTS: One hundred and five cases of irritable bowel syndrome and 105 controls 
      were enrolled. Coeliac disease was diagnosed in 12 of the irritable bowel
      syndrome patients and none of the controls. Eleven coeliac disease patients
      adhered to a gluten free diet. After 6 months, all 11 patients had significant
      improvement in symptoms and three were totally asymptomatic. Six allowed repeated
      endoscopy after 6 months of gluten free diet, of which five showed improvement in
      histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease is a common finding among
      patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome. In this sub-group, a gluten free
      diet may lead to a significant improvement in symptoms. Routine testing for
      coeliac disease may be indicated in all patients being evaluated for irritable
      bowel syndrome.

TI  - Constipation: evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 659-83
AB  - Constipation is a common clinical problem that comprises a constellation of
      symptoms that include excessive straining, hard stools, feeling of incomplete
      evacuation, use of digital maneuvers, or infrequent defecation. Although many
      conditions, such as metabolic problems, fiber deficiency, anorectal problems, and
      drugs, can cause constipation, when excluded functional constipation consists of 
      two subtypes: slow-transit constipation and dyssynergic defecation. Some patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome may exhibit features of both types of constipation.
      The Rome criteria for functional constipation together with modifications
      proposed here for dyssynergic defecation may serve as useful guidelines for
      making a diagnosis. Recent advances in technology, together with a better
      understanding of the underlying mechanisms, have led to real progress in the
      diagnosis of this condition. Management options are limited, however, and
      evidence to support these treatments is only modest. The treatment is primarily
      medical; surgical options should be reserved for refractory disease and after
      careful diagnostic work-up. Although laxatives remain the mainstay of therapy,
      prokinetics that are colon-selective are optimal for treating patients with
      slow-transit constipation, but they are not yet available for clinical use.
      Recent controlled trials, however, are promising. Biofeedback therapy is the
      preferred treatment for patients with dyssynergia, but is not widely available.
      In the near future, user-friendly biofeedback programs including home therapy may
      facilitate wider use of these methods for patients with dyssynergic defecation.

PG  - 619-58
AB  - Chronic gastroparesis and CIP are debilitating disorders that are difficult to
      treat with currently available therapies. Failure of proper migration and
      differentiation of enteric neurons or ICC can result from specific genetic
      mutations and lead to phenotypes of CIP with or without concomitant
      gastroparesis. Intestinal dysfunction in diabetes may reflect a depletion of NO
      production (and perhaps other neurotransmitters or modulators), which is manifest
      as a syndrome of gastroparesis, diarrhea, or constipation in individual patients.
      As the key molecular changes underlying these disorders are defined, clinicians
      will begin to understand their precise etiology and rational medical therapy may 
      become possible. In the future, testable hypotheses regarding the etiology of
      other functional bowel disorders (e.g., functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel
      syndrome, and so forth) may be developed.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: evaluation and treatment.
PG  - 507-29
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      abdominal pain, bloating, and disturbed defecation in the absence of other
      medical conditions with similar presentations. Because physical findings and
      currently available diagnostic tests lack sufficient specificity for clinical
      use, the diagnosis of IBS is based on characteristic symptoms as outlined in
      several symptom-based criteria for IBS. When used in combination with a detailed 
      history, physical examination, and limited diagnostic testing, these criteria are
      a valid method of diagnosing IBS. Once a confident diagnosis of IBS has been
      made, treatment of IBS should be based on the predominant symptom while taking
      into account the severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment
      both physically and psychologically. Most patients with IBS have mild symptoms
      and education, reassurance, dietary and lifestyle changes, and a therapeutic
      physician-patient relationship form the backbone of treatment. A smaller number
      of patients have moderate symptoms, which are typically intermittent, but may at 
      times interrupt their normal activities. In addition to dietary and lifestyle
      modifications, pharmacologic intervention based on the predominant symptom
      (diarrhea, constipation, or pain) may be used to relieve symptoms. Finally, a
      small subset of patients has severe or intractable symptoms. These patients,
      often seen in tertiary referral centers, often have constant pain symptoms and
      psychosocial impairments. A multidisciplinary approach including pharmacologic
      treatments, psychologic treatments, and possibly a mental health or pain center
      involvement may be beneficial.

TI  - Diverticular disease of the colon: new perspectives in symptom development and
      treatment.
PG  - 1385-9
AB  - Diverticular disease of the colon is a common disease worldwide. Although the
      disease is asymptomatic in about 70-80 % of patients, it represents, at least in 
      Western countries, one of the most important gastrointestinal diseases in terms
      of direct and indirect health costs. Pathogenesis of the disease is still
      unknown. However, it is the result of complex interactions between colonic
      structure, intestinal motility, diet and genetic factors. Whilst efficacious
      preventive strategies remain to be identified, fibre supplementation in the diet 
      is recommended. Why symptoms develop is still unclear. Results of recent
      experimental studies on irritable bowel syndrome speculated that low grade
      inflammation of colonic mucosa, induced by changes in bacterial microflora, could
      affect the enteric nervous system, which is crucial for normal gut function, thus
      favouring symptom development. This hypothesis could be extrapolated also for
      diverticular disease, since bacterial overgrowth is present, at least in a
      subgroup of patients. These perspectives on symptom development are reviewed and 
      new therapeutic approaches are hypothesized.

TI  - Partially hydrolyzed guar gum: clinical nutrition uses.
PG  - 549-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a review of research on partially hydrolyzed guar 
      gum that is relevant to clinical nutrition practice. METHODS: All relevant papers
      published on partially hydrolyzed guar gum were reviewed and the results
      summarized. RESULTS: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble
      dietary fiber with a wide range of uses in clinical nutrition. Its low viscosity 
      allows its use in enteral products and beverages. PHGG can be added to enteral
      formulas and food products as a dietary fiber source. PHGG provides the benefits 
      associated with dietary fiber ingestion. Addition of PHGG to the diet reduced
      laxative dependence in a nursing home population. PHGG also reduced the incidence
      of diarrhea in septic patients receiving total enteral nutrition and reduced
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. PHGG also increased production of
      Bifidobacterium in the gut. CONCLUSION: The ease of use of PHGG and its clinical 
      effectiveness make it a good choice in clinical nutrition practice.

TI  - Increased platelet depleted plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration following
      meal ingestion in symptomatic female subjects with diarrhoea predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 663-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meal ingestion is often associated with exacerbation of
      gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Furthermore, recent preliminary data suggest that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
      concentration in platelet poor plasma is elevated following meal ingestion in
      some subjects with diarrhoea predominant IBS (d-IBS) compared with healthy
      subjects, although it is not known whether this is related to postprandial
      symptomatology. AIM: To expand on previous data by evaluating a larger number of 
      subjects but also to assess plasma 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)
      concentrations, 5-HT turnover, platelet 5-HT stores, and any relationship to
      symptomatology. METHODS: We assessed platelet depleted plasma 5-HT and 5-HIAA
      concentrations for two hours (60 minute intervals) under fasting conditions, and 
      then for a further four hours (30 minute intervals) after a standard carbohydrate
      meal (457 kcal), together with fasting platelet 5-HT concentrations in 39 female 
      subjects with d-IBS (aged 19-52 years; mean age 33) and 20 healthy female
      volunteers (aged 20-46 years, mean age 28). IBS symptomatology, in particular
      abdominal pain and bloating, and urgency to defecate were assessed throughout the
      study RESULTS: When related to fasting levels, there was no statistically
      significant difference in postprandial plasma 5-HT concentrations between d-IBS
      and healthy subjects. However, when fasting levels were not taken into
      consideration, d-IBS subjects exhibited higher postprandial plasma 5-HT
      concentrations compared with healthy subjects (p=0.040). Furthermore, d-IBS
      subjects who exhibited postprandial symptomatology had higher levels of
      postprandial plasma 5-HT, whether assessed with respect to fasting baseline
      levels (p=0.069) or not (p=0.047), compared with d-IBS subjects who did not
      report postprandial symptomatology. This appeared to be associated with a
      concomitant increase in plasma 5-HIAA (p=0.161) but reduction in turnover
      (p=0.058). Lastly, d-IBS subjects had higher platelet concentrations of 5-HT than
      healthy subjects (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that postprandial
      symptomatology may be associated with increased platelet depleted plasma 5-HT
      concentrations in female subjects with d-IBS. In addition, the presence of
      increased platelet stores of 5-HT may act as a useful marker for the diagnosis
      and management of d-IBS.

TI  - A systematic review of alternative therapies in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder associated with a significant
      burden of illness, poor quality of life, high rates of absenteeism, and high
      health care utilization. Management can be difficult and treatment unrewarding;
      these facts have led physicians and patients toward alternative therapies. We
      explored a variety of treatments that exist beyond the scope of commonly used
      therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Guarded optimism exists for traditional
      Chinese medicine and psychological therapies, but further well-designed trials
      are needed. Oral cromolyn sodium may be useful in chronic unexplained diarrhea
      and appears as effective as and safer than elimination diets. The roles of
      lactose and fructose intolerance remain poorly understood. Alterations of enteric
      flora may play a role in irritable bowel syndrome, but supporting evidence for
      bacterial overgrowth or probiotic therapy is lacking.

TI  - Systematic review of treatments for recurrent abdominal pain.
PG  - e1-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evaluated treatments for recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) in children. METHODS: Online bibliographic databases were
      searched for the terms "recurrent abdominal pain," "functional abdominal pain,"
      "children," or "alternative therapies" in articles classified as randomized
      controlled trials. The abstracts or full text of 57 relevant articles were
      examined; 10 of these met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria required that
      the study involve children aged 5 to 18 years, subjects have a diagnosis of RAP, 
      and that subjects were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. The
      methodology and findings of these articles were evaluated critically, and data
      were extracted from each article regarding study methods, specific interventions,
      outcomes measured, and results. RESULTS: Studies that evaluated famotidine,
      pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and peppermint oil
      enteric-coated capsules showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes for those who
      received the interventions when compared with others in control groups. The
      studies that evaluated dietary interventions had conflicting results, in the case
      of fiber, or showed no efficacy, in the case of lactose avoidance. CONCLUSIONS:
      Evidence for efficacy of treatment of RAP in children was found for therapies
      that used famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and
      peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules. The effects of dietary fiber were less
      conclusive, and the use of a lactose-free diet showed no improvement. There
      seemed to be greater improvement when therapy (famotidine, pizotifen, peppermint 
      oil) was targeted to the specific functional gastrointestinal disorder
      (dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, irritable bowel syndrome). The behavioral
      interventions seemed to have a general positive effect on children with
      nonspecific RAP. Many of these therapies have not been used widely as standard
      treatment for children with RAP. Although the mechanism of action for each
      effective therapy is not fully understood, each is believed to be safe for use in
      RAP.
