TI  - Treatments for irritable bowel syndrome: patients' attitudes and acceptability.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-8-65 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a highly prevalent chronic disorder, places
      significant burden on the health service and the individual. Symptomatic distress
      and reduced quality of life are compounded by few efficacious treatments
      available. As researchers continue to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of
      alternative therapies, it would be useful to gain a patient-perspective of
      treatment acceptability and identify patient's attitudes towards those modalities
      considered not acceptable. METHODS: Six hundred and forty-five participants
      identified from an earlier IBS-prevalence study received a postal questionnaire
      to evaluate preferences and acceptability of nine forms of treatment. Proportions
      accepting each form of treatment were calculated and thematic analysis of
      qualitative data undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 256 (39.7%) of 645 potential
      respondents completed the questionnaire (mean age 55.9 years, 73% female).
      Tablets were most acceptable (84%), followed by lifestyle changes (diet (82%),
      yoga (77%)). Acupuncture (59%) and suppositories (57%) were less acceptable. When
      explaining lack of acceptability, patient views fell into four broad categories: 
      dislike treatment modality, do not perceive benefit, general barriers and
      insufficient knowledge. Scepticism, lack of scientific rationale and fear of CAM 
      were mentioned, although others expressed a dislike of conventional medical
      treatments. Past experiences, age and health concerns, and need for proof of
      efficacy were reported. CONCLUSION: Most patients were willing to accept various 
      forms of treatment. However, the reservations expressed by this
      patient-population must be recognised with particular focus directed towards
      allaying fears and misconceptions, seeking further evidence base for certain
      therapies and incorporating physician support and advice.

PG  - 605-22; quiz 623
LID - 10.2217/17455057.4.6.605 [doi]
AB  - The estimated prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Western countries
      is 7-15%, with a female:male ratio of 2-2.5:1 in IBS patients who seek healthcare
      services; however, the female predominance is lower in the general population.
      IBS has a significant impact on health-related quality of life and is associated 
      with a significant healthcare and economic burden. Management of IBS is comprised
      of general measures and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. However,
      there are ongoing efforts to find more effective therapeutic approaches. As
      advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS continue to grow,
      new and effective treatments with novel mechanisms of action that have the
      potential to improve relief of IBS symptoms over current treatments are likely to
      be developed. This article provides an overview of current and emerging therapies
      for IBS and also highlights sex and gender differences in clinical trials and
      treatment response.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a trans-galactooligosaccharide prebiotic on faecal
      microbiota and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 508-18
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03911.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy 
      of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic
      microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44
      patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel
      crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either
      3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored 
      weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal
      microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global
      assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
      RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 
      0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters
      monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency
      (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score
      of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly
      improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut
      bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These
      findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.

AB  - Lubiprostone, a bicyclic fatty acid chloride channel activator, is efficacious in
      treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. The study aim was to compare effects of lubiprostone and placebo on
      colonic sensory and motor functions in humans. In double-blind, randomized
      fashion, 60 healthy adults received three oral doses of placebo or 24 microg
      lubiprostone per day in a parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. A
      barostat-manometry tube was placed in the left colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy
      and fluoroscopy. We measured treatment effects on colonic sensation and motility 
      with validated methods, with the following end points: colonic compliance,
      fasting and postprandial tone and motility indexes, pain thresholds, and sensory 
      ratings to distensions. Among participants receiving lubiprostone or placebo, 26 
      of 30 and 28 of 30, respectively, completed the study. There were no overall
      effects of lubiprostone on compliance, fasting tone, motility indexes, or
      sensation. However, there was a treatment-by-sex interaction effect for
      compliance (P = 0.02), with lubiprostone inducing decreased fasting compliance in
      women (P = 0.06) and an overall decreased colonic tone contraction after a
      standard meal relative to fasting tone (P = 0.014), with greater effect in women 
      (P < 0.01). Numerical differences of first sensation and pain thresholds (P =
      0.11 in women) in the two groups were not significant. We concluded that oral
      lubiprostone 24 microg does not increase colonic motor function. The findings of 
      decreased colonic compliance and decreased postprandial colonic tone in women
      suggest that motor effects are unlikely to cause accelerated colonic transit with
      lubiprostone, although they may facilitate laxation. Effects of lubiprostone on
      sensitivity deserve further study.

TI  - Patients' explanatory models for irritable bowel syndrome: symptoms and treatment
      more important than explaining aetiology.
PG  - 40-7
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmn087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition associated with 
      no certain organic cause, though diet and stress are widely implicated. The
      condition is frustrating for both sufferers and doctors, and there are problems
      in diagnosing and treating the condition. Eliciting explanatory models (EMs) is a
      useful tool for understanding how individuals relate to their illnesses and their
      expectations for treatment, particularly for illnesses with uncertain aetiology
      like IBS. OBJECTIVES: To understand the EMs, experiences and expectations for
      management of patients with IBS. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews
      were conducted with 51 primary care patients (31 in the UK, 20 in The
      Netherlands) meeting the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS. RESULTS: Although
      IBS often had a significant dampening effect on daily life, IBS patients made
      great efforts not to allow the condition to take over their lives. Triggers of
      symptoms were more important to patients than understanding the underlying
      aetiology of IBS. Diet and stress were both recognized as important triggers, but
      views about which foods were problematic and the extent to which stress was
      modifiable were inconsistent. Diagnosis and treatment were often a confusing and 
      frustrating process, and patients often expected more diagnostic tests than they 
      were offered before receiving a diagnosis of IBS. However, the often poor outcome
      of medical interventions does not, in general, appear to have a negative impact
      on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of
      the extensive impact of IBS on sufferers' daily life and the frustration that
      results from repeatedly trying treatments with little effect. Clearly explaining 
      the guidelines for diagnosing IBS and the range of treatment options may help
      patients to make sense of the diagnostic and treatment processes. The personal EM
      should be addressed during the consultation with the IBS patient, ensuring that
      any successive medical interventions match with the patients' disease perception.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is controlled by the independent enteric nervous
      system. It is also closely connected to the central nervous system, and
      bi-directional communication exists between them. The communication involves
      neural pathways as well as immune and endocrine mechanisms. The brain-gut axis
      plays a prominent role in the modulation of gut functions. Signals from different
      sources (e.g. sound, sight, smell, somatic and visceral sensations, pain) reach
      the brain. These inputs are modified by memory, cognition and affective
      mechanisms and integrated within the neural circuits of the central nervous
      system, spinal cord, autonomic and enteral nervous systems. These inputs can have
      physiologic effects, such as changes in motility, secretion, immune function, and
      blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. One of the most important
      neurotransmitters is serotonin that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the
      most common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder: the irritable bowel
      syndrome. It is a biopsychosocial disease, resulting from the dysregulation of
      the brain-gut axis. Endogenous pain facilitation rather than inhibition,
      pathologic gradation of visceral perception and reduced threshold for pain are
      all evident in these patients. Abuse history is common in their anamnesis.
      Exaggerated conscientiousness, perfectionism, oversensitivity, feeling of
      deficiency in effectiveness, and higher demand for social parity, neuroticism and
      alexithymia have been detected among their constant personality features. Females
      are also characterized by gender role conflict and low assertiveness.
      Antidepressants and psychotherapy have important roles in their treatment. Also
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease are characterized by neuroticism and
      alexithymia and altered mother-child attachment is often described in their
      anamnesis. Autonomic neuropathy is a frequent and early neurological
      complication. Reflux disease and obstructive sleep apnea mutually generate each
      other and their severities significantly correlate. In the celiac disease the
      most common neurological manifestations are ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and
      myopathy. Up to 85% of patients with histologically proven coeliac disease have
      no gastrointestinal symptoms; consequently, measurement of antigliadin antibody
      titre is therefore vital in all cases of idiopathic ataxia. Complete resolution
      of neurological symptoms is the result of gluten-free diet.

TI  - Improved arthritic knee health in a pilot RCT of phytotherapy.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Although practitioner-prescribed 'western' herbal medicine (phytotherapy) is a
      popular complementary therapy in the UK, no clinical studies have been reported
      on patient-orientated outcomes. The objective of this pilot study was to
      investigate the effects of phytotherapy on symptoms of osteoarthritis of the
      knee. A previous study of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of irritable 
      bowel syndrome, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
      acted as a model in the development of the protocol of this investigation. Twenty
      adults, previously diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee, were recruited from
      two Inner London GP practices into this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, pilot study carried out in a primary-care setting. All
      subjects were seen in consultation three times by a herbal practitioner who was
      blinded to the randomization coding. Each subject was prescribed treatment and
      given lifestyle advice according to usual practice: continuation of conventional 
      medication where applicable, healthy-eating advice and nutrient supplementation. 
      Individualized herbal medicine was prescribed for each patient, but only
      dispensed for those randomized to active treatment-- the remainder were supplied 
      with a placebo. At baseline and outcome (after ten weeks of treatment), subjects 
      completed a food frequency questionnaire and the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee health and Measure Yourself
      Outcome Profile (MYMOP) wellbeing questionnaires. Subjects completing the study
      per protocol (n = 14) reported an increased intake of wholegrain foods (p =
      0.045) and oily fish (p = 0.039) compared to baseline, but no increase in fruit
      and vegetables and dairy products intakes. There was no difference in the primary
      outcome measure of knee health assessed as the difference in the mean response
      (baseline-week 10) in WOMAC score between the two treatment groups. However,
      there was, compared with baseline, improvement in the active group (n = 9) for
      the mean WOMAC stiffness sub-score at week 5 (p = 0.035) and week 10 (p = 0.060) 
      but not in the placebo group (n = 5). Furthermore, for the active, but not the
      placebo group, the mean WOMAC total and sub-scores all showed clinically
      significant improvement (> or = 20%) in knee symptoms at weeks 5 and 10 compared 
      with baseline. Moreover, the mean MYMOP symptom 2 sub-score, mostly relating to
      osteoarthritis (OA), showed significant improvement at week 5 (p = 0.02) and week
      10 (p = 0.008) compared with baseline for the active, but not for the placebo
      group. This pilot study showed that herbal medicine prescribed for the individual
      by a herbal practitioner resulted in improvement of symptoms of OA of the knee.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on abdominal distension and gastrointestinal
      transit in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03853.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in
      girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed
      transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with
      acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with 
      constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control
      product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms
      were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS:
      Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant
      reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference -
      39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension
      during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal 
      [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P =
      0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P =
      0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in
      objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as
      reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit 
      is a useful strategy for treating distension.

TI  - Are gastrointestinal symptoms related to diabetes mellitus and glycemic control?
PG  - 822-5
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3282f5f75e [doi]
AB  - Many patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from upper and lower GI symptoms. The
      reported prevalence of these symptoms varies among different ethnic
      groups/populations. The natural history of GI symptoms as well as their
      pathogenesis in patients with diabetes remains poorly understood, although it is 
      known that gastric emptying is influenced by hyperglycemia, euglycemia, and
      hypoglycemia. Poor glycemic control over a long period of time can lead to
      neuropathy and damage the vagus nerve, resulting in diabetic gastroparesis whose 
      signs and symptoms vary in the individual patient. Gastroparesis can further
      worsen glycemic control by adversely altering the pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered hypoglycemic agents as well as by altering the delivery of
      diet-derived calories to intestines from which absorption, subsequently,
      determines incipient blood glucose, and thus effectiveness of various injectable 
      antidiabetics including various insulins and related insulin analogs. As GI
      symptoms may overlap with other disorders, including functional dyspepsia,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, it is important to have such
      patients/patients with diabetes undergo standardized testing for measuring
      gastric emptying. Certain medications including metformin, amylin analogues (i.e.
      pramlintide), glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (i.e. exenatide, liraglutide),
      anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, calcium-channel blockers, and others may
      contribute to GI symptoms observed in patients with diabetes. Given the global
      diabetes pandemic, it is of utmost importance to not only diagnose and treat
      present patients with diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities, but also to help
      prevent the development of further disease burden by educating children and
      adolescents about healthy lifestyle modifications (avoidance of overeating,
      portion control, healthy food choices, increased physical and reduced sedentary
      activity), as changing behavior in adulthood has proven to be notoriously
      difficult.

TI  - Dietary survey and total dietary fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome attending a tertiary referral hospital.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on their chemical extraction, dietary fibers are classified
      into crude fibers and total dietary fibers (TDF). TDF gives the best estimate of 
      fiber content in the diet. Whereas data on intake of crude fibers are available, 
      there is a lack of data on intake of TDF in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). AIM: We assessed the TDF and its source in the diet of patients
      with IBS and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Based on their predominant symptoms,
      81 patients with IBS (according to Rome II criteria) were categorized into
      constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=48), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D, n=16) and
      mixed type (IBS-M, n=17). Information was collected on fiber supplementation and 
      preference for high-fiber food. A pretested, open-ended, semi-quantitative food
      frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information on food groups
      and TDF. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=89) were recruited as HC.
      The mean (SD) age of patients and HC was 36.5 (11.4) years (59 men), and 36 (12) 
      years (62 men), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (48%) were taking
      medicinal fiber supplements, of which 28 patients were taking supplements daily
      (2.10 [0.84] teaspoon full). The mean daily TDF intake was 51.7 (23.1) g vs. 52.3
      (21.6) g for patients and HC, respectively (p=0.8). The intake of TDF was similar
      in patients having less (n=41) or more (n=40) preference for fiber-rich foods (55
      [23] g vs. 47 [22] g, p=0.16). The daily mean cereal intake in patients was
      significantly lower than that in HC (322 g vs. 404 g, p=0.001). However,
      consumption of fruits (150 g vs. 80 g, p=0.001) and vegetables (348 g vs. 219 g, 
      p=0.006) was higher in patients in comparison with HC. There was a positive
      correlation between TDF with cereals (p=0.001), pulses (p=0.001), vegetables and 
      fruits (p=0.033) in patients with IBS but only with cereals (p=0.001) in HC.
      CONCLUSION: The intake of TDF in patients with IBS and HC is much higher than the
      dietary recommendation for healthy Indians. Patients with IBS consumed more
      fruits and vegetables rather than cereals as compared with HC.

TI  - Clinical trial: effect of active lactic acid bacteria on mucosal barrier function
      in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 994-1002
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03818.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with
      diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the
      possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal
      permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a
      randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients
      were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus,
      Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum)
      or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and
      intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of
      lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the
      total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel
      permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023
      (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel
      permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However,
      colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo 
      group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean
      global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/-
      1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment
      for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The recruitment process may generate a selected patient sample, which 
      may threaten the generalizability of trial results. This risk is particularly
      high in case disease and patient characteristics demonstrate a wide variation,
      such as in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We compared IBS patients who were
      selected, approached, and randomized to participate in a clinical trial assessing
      the efficacy of dietary fiber therapy in IBS. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Retrospective survey in primary care patients diagnosed with IBS by their general
      practitioner in the past 2 years selected and invited for participation in a
      trial. Characteristics were compared between randomized patients (n=193)
      nonrandomized eligible patients (n=371), and patients not eligible for
      participating in the trial (n=724). RESULTS: Of the 2,100 IBS patients, 1,288
      (61%) returned the questionnaire. Randomized patients had a higher intensity of
      IBS abdominal pain as compared to the other groups, a higher consultation rate
      and a longer IBS disease history. Noneligible patients had less active IBS
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized do differ from those nonrandomized in 
      IBS disease characteristics. These observations may have implications for the
      applicability of our research outcome.

PG  - 184-91

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) experience similar symptoms; however, individuals with IBD
      have alterations in their digestive tract and an increased probability of
      developing colorectal cancer, whereas individuals with IBS do not. Although not
      well documented within the literature, individuals with gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders may engage in adverse behaviors regarding their intake of food,
      regardless of the fact that the "offending agents" have been identified. Further 
      study into these negative behaviors is warranted for healthcare professionals to 
      be provided with a better understanding of the behaviors that individuals with GI
      disorders knowingly engage in, despite the negative consequences. PURPOSE: The
      overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women
      diagnosed with the GI disorders IBD and/or IBS, with an emphasis on the dietary
      patterns of the women before and after diagnosis. Specifically, this article
      examines the adverse behaviors that women engaged in with respect to the
      consumption of food, beverages, and medications. METHODS: Eight women diagnosed
      with IBD or IBS were recruited from a university campus in southwestern Ontario, 
      Canada. Participants completed a background questionnaire, a 14-day food diary,
      and a semistructured interview consisting of 8 open-ended questions. RESULTS:
      Three major themes were identified: family and friend support, control, and
      adverse behaviors. The focus of this article, the theme of adverse behaviors,
      consisted of 2 major subthemes: dietary restrictions and issues with medication. 
      All women engaged in adverse behaviors regarding their food intake and/or
      consumption of medications as related to food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Semistructured
      interviews with women diagnosed with IBD and IBS revealed that all women felt
      governed by their bowels to varying degrees. In addition, all women within this
      sample knowingly engaged in behaviors concerning food/beverages that had the
      potential to be detrimental to their conditions. A myriad of reasons were given
      for consuming foods/beverages. Implications for nursing practitioners are
      discussed.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common conditions seen in
      primary care settings. Despite this, there is no consensus as to the pathogenesis
      of this disorder or a consistently effective therapeutic regimen for many
      patients. This has encouraged the use of various alternative therapies from
      behavioral or complementary medicine. This review will address the evidence for
      alternative therapies, including the following: cognitive behavior therapy,
      hypnosis, elimination diets based on food antibody testing, nutrition supplements
      (such as fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics), and, finally, peppermint,
      l-glutamine, zinc, and cromolyn sodium. The review also explores the evidence for
      and the therapeutic ramifications of the hypothesis that increased intestinal
      permeability underlies the symptoms of IBS in many patients, and how a
      therapeutic plan that addresses nutrition, elimination diets, and nutrition
      supplements may be useful in restoring the integrity of the gut immune barrier.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized 
      by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency
      and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care
      services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely 
      multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and
      dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their
      symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report
      menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management
      include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress
      reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain
      sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the
      pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current
      therapeutic approaches for symptom management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of the endogenous protein anti-secretory factor
      (ASF) on the symptoms, especially loose stools, in irritable bowel ayndrome
      (IBS). DESIGN: A diet with specially processed cereals (SPC) known to induce ASF 
      production was used in patients with IBS, in an eight-week randomized,
      placebo-controlled study. SUBJECTS: Eighty-two patients with IBS were randomized 
      to a diet with either SPC or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The overall clinical
      condition and the quality of life were measured by VAS and SF-36 questionnaire,
      respectively. The plasma levels of ASF were determined in 14 patients with
      dominating loose stools before and after diet. RESULTS: All patients
      significantly (p<0.001) improved in IBS-related symptoms irrespective of active
      or placebo diet. In an active-diet sub-group with diarrhoea (n=11) there was a
      significant (p<0.05) correlation between the increase of plasma ASF level and the
      improvement on the VAS. CONCLUSION: Both study groups improved significantly on
      the VAS but no additive effect was seen for the active treatment. In the
      sub-group with loose stools, the SPC diet induced ASF plasma levels in IBS
      patients and was correlated to significant symptom improvement in the individual 
      patient.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal
      pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a 
      disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore
      therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more
      recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI)
      microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of
      probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an
      upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the
      host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article 
      explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might
      lead to therapeutic benefit.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) are reported to have
      a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms partly attributed to an overrepresentation
      of celiac disease. We have observed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
      symptoms are frequent complaints in this patient group. Allergic manifestations
      to various drugs are also common in pSS. A role of food allergy in IBS has been
      proposed. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the mucosal response to
      rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) in patients with pSS and relates
      possible CM reactivity to their intestinal symptoms. METHODS: A rectal challenge 
      with CM was performed in 21 patients with pSS and 18 healthy controls. Fifteen
      hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the release
      of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as signs of mucosal inflammatory reaction were measured 
      using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Eight out of 21 patients with pSS had
      a definite increase of mucosal NO synthesis and the luminal release of MPO after 
      rectal CM challenge. This sign of milk sensitivity was not linked to IgG/IgA
      antibodies to milk proteins. The symptoms for IBS according to Rome III criteria 
      were fulfilled in 13 patients. All patients who were CM sensitive suffered from
      IBS. In a small open study, patients reactive to CM reported an improvement of
      intestinal symptoms on a CM-free diet. CONCLUSION: A rectal mucosal inflammatory 
      response after CM challenge is seen in 38% of patients with pSS as a sign of CM
      sensitivity. IBS-like symptoms were common in pSS, linked to CM sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Observational studies suggest dietary fructose restriction
      might lead to sustained symptomatic response in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and fructose malabsorption. The aims of this study were first to
      determine whether the efficacy of this dietary change is due to dietary fructose 
      restriction and second to define whether symptom relief was specific to free
      fructose or to poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general. METHODS: The
      double-blinded, randomized, quadruple arm, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial
      took place in the general community. The 25 patients who had responded to dietary
      change were provided all food, low in free fructose and fructans, for the
      duration of the study. Patients were randomly challenged by graded dose
      introduction of fructose, fructans, alone or in combination, or glucose taken as 
      drinks with meals for maximum test period of 2 weeks, with at least 10-day
      washout period between. For the main outcome measures, symptoms were monitored by
      daily diary entries and responses to a global symptom question. RESULTS: Seventy 
      percent of patients receiving fructose, 77% receiving fructans, and 79% receiving
      a mixture reported symptoms were not adequately controlled, compared with 14%
      receiving glucose (P < or = 0.002, McNemar test). Similarly, the severity of
      overall and individual symptoms was significantly and markedly less for glucose
      than other substances. Symptoms were induced in a dose-dependent manner and
      mimicked previous IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS and fructose
      malabsorption, dietary restriction of fructose and/or fructans is likely to be
      responsible for symptomatic improvement, suggesting efficacy is due to
      restriction of poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general.

TI  - Chronic constipation - the role of clinical assessment and colorectal physiologic
      tests to obtain an etiologic diagnosis.
PG  - 50-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of subtypes of chronic constipation has been considered
      difficult to achieve even in specialized centers. Although colorectal physiologic
      tests have brought an important contribution, it remains unclear in which
      patients these tests should be indicated for. AIMS: This study aims to establish 
      a differential diagnosis for chronic constipation cases using clinical assessment
      and physiologic tests and to identify clinical parameters that could predict
      which patients need physiologic tests. METHODS: One hundred and seventy nine
      patients (83% females; mean age, 45) with chronic constipation according to Rome 
      II criteria were initially treated by dietary advice and functional reeducation
      and those unresponsive (110 or 61.5%) were submitted to colonic transit time,
      defecography, anorectal manometry and electromyography, as needed. RESULTS: A
      differential diagnosis was achieved in 63.6% of patients tested. However, 61.5%
      of 179 patients with chronic constipation (69 with no need to tests and 40 with
      normal tests) have etiologic diagnosis established only on clinical basis.
      Irritable bowel syndrome (32%), pelvic floor dysfunction (29%) and functional
      constipation due to faulty diet and life style habits (22%) were the main causes 
      of chronic constipation. Alternating constipation and nausea/vomiting were
      symptoms significantly related to the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome;
      younger age, larger intervals between bowel movements, occurrence of fecal
      impaction and necessity of enema were related to the diagnosis of non-chagasic
      megacolon and digital assistance to evacuate and large rectocele or spastic
      pelvic floor on rectal exam were associated to pelvic floor dysfunction. Patients
      with long-standing constipation, fecal impaction, abdominal pain not eased after 
      defecation, necessity for enemas, digital assistance and evidence of rectocele
      tended to be in need for physiologic tests to define the cause of chronic
      constipation. CONCLUSIONS: The etiologic diagnosis of chronic constipation can be
      achieved in most of patients on a clinical basis and some symptoms may be
      significantly related to specific diagnoses. Indications for physiologic tests
      should be based on specific clinical parameters.

      is worthwhile?].
PG  - 279-91
LID - 10.1055/s-2007-963427 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has increased over the last 50
      years in countries where a Western-style diet has been prominent or introduced
      and 20 - 65 % of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their
      symptoms to something in food that activates an abnormal response. However, data 
      from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although
      investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete
      review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre
      diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there
      appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this
      subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but
      dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear
      that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and
      probiotics in these areas.

TI  - Hormones of the gut-brain axis as targets for the treatment of upper
      gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 241-54
LID - 10.1038/nrd2444 [doi]
AB  - The concept of the gut forming the centre of an integrated gut-brain-energy axis 
      - modulating appetite, metabolism and digestion - opens up new paradigms for
      drugs that can tackle multiple symptoms in complex upper gastrointestinal
      disorders. These include eating disorders, nausea and vomiting, gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease, gastroparesis, dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. The
      hormones that modulate gastric motility represent targets for gastric prokinetic 
      drugs, and peptides that modify eating behaviours may be targeted to develop
      drugs that reduce nausea, a currently poorly treated condition. The gut-brain
      axis may therefore provide a range of therapeutic opportunities that deliver a
      more holistic treatment of upper gastrointestinal disorders.

PG  - 741-51
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03647.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renewed interest in the use of antibiotics to prevent travellers'
      diarrhoea has occurred with the availability of non-absorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin,
      and with evidence that a subgroup of travellers with diarrhoea have progression
      of their illnesses to postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To summarize 
      recently published information and make recommendations on travellers' diarrhoea 
      prevention. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed on 2 January 2008 for 255 articles on
      the topic of 'travellers diarrhoea' published beginning with 2000 along with the 
      author's extensive file on prevention of travellers' diarrhoea. RESULTS:
      Exercising care in food and beverage selection, while of unproven value, is
      recommended during travel to high-risk areas of Latin America, Southern Asia or
      Africa. An algorithm is presented to identify future travellers, for which
      chemoprophylaxis is appropriate. The preferred drug for prevention of travellers'
      diarrhoea is rifaximin, with bismuth subsalicylate or a fluoroquinolone also
      being effective. Vaccines against the principal cause of travellers' diarrhoea,
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, are being developed. CONCLUSIONS: Research is
      needed to determine the relative effectiveness of exercising care on food and
      beverage selection and chemoprophylaxis in preventing travellers' diarrhoea and
      postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome during high-risk travel. Enterotoxigenic 
      E. coli vaccines appear to be a promising addition to travel medicine.

TI  - Plasma and gastric mucosal 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations following cold
      water intake in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 2330-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the
      effects of cold water intake on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite
      5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (d-IBS) patients, and to observe the relationship between 5-HT and
      symptomatology. METHODS: The plasma 5-HT/5-HIAA concentrations at 0, 30 min, 60
      min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min and 180 min following cold or warm water intake
      were investigated in 32 female subjects with d-IBS and 21 healthy female
      subjects. Gastric mucosal 5-HT under fasting conditions and following water
      intake were further investigated in 15 d-IBS patients and nine healthy subjects. 
      Symptomatology was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: The plasma 5-HT
      concentrations in IBS patients were significantly higher than those of controls
      at 30 min (P = 0.022), 60 min (P < 0.001), 90 min (P < 0.001), 120 min (P <
      0.001) and 150 min (P = 0.001) after cold water intake. The peak plasma
      5-HT/5-HIAA and area under the curve for 5-HT/5-HIAA were also higher in d-IBS
      patients (P < 0.001). Gastric mucosal 5-HT in d-IBS patients and controls did not
      show any significant differences both under fasting condition (P = 0.596) and
      after cold water intake (P = 0.426). Last, the d-IBS patients with symptoms had
      higher 5-HT concentration (P < 0.001) and there was a positive correlation (r =
      0.714, P = 0.001)between the symptomatology and plasma 5-HT level. CONCLUSIONS:
      These data suggest that symptomatology following cold water intake may be
      associated with increased plasma 5-HT concentrations in female subjects with
      d-IBS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies 
      for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on 
      physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed 
      by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions 
      for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE
      (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO 
      (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and
      JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were
      employed. In addition, researchers working in this area were asked to identify
      relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of
      any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with 
      a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II
      criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials
      for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies
      were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were
      included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre
      supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one
      study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled
      odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.16 (95% CI
      0.45-2.87). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983)
      compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a
      form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to 
      follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three
      trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation
      with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two
      (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided
      analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% 
      CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on
      the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that
      fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are
      effective in the management of children with RAP.

TI  - Fructose intolerance in IBS and utility of fructose-restricted diet.
PG  - 233-8
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31802cbc2f [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Whether dietary fructose intolerance causes symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) is unclear. We examined the prevalence of fructose
      intolerance in IBS and long-term outcome of fructose-restricted diet. METHODS:
      Two hundred and nine patients with suspected IBS were retrospectively evaluated
      for organic illnesses. Patients with IBS (Rome II) and positive fructose breath
      test received instructions regarding fructose-restricted diet. One year later,
      their symptoms, compliance with, and effects of dietary modification on lifestyle
      were assessed using a structured interview. RESULTS: Eighty patients (m/f=26/54) 
      fulfilled Rome II criteria. Of 80 patients, 31 (38%) had positive breath test. Of
      31 patients, 26 (84%) participated in follow-up (mean=13 mo) evaluation. Of 26
      patients, 14 (53%) were compliant with diet; mean compliance=71%. In this group, 
      pain, belching, bloating, fullness, indigestion, and diarrhea improved (P<0.02). 
      Of 26 patients, 12 (46%) were noncompliant, and their symptoms were unchanged,
      except belching. The mean impact on lifestyle, compliant versus noncompliant
      groups was 2.93 versus 2.57 (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of patients
      with suspected IBS had fructose intolerance. When compliant, symptoms improved on
      fructose-restricted diet despite moderate impact on lifestyle; noncompliance was 
      associated with persistent symptoms. Fructose intolerance is another jigsaw piece
      of the IBS puzzle that may respond to dietary modification.

TI  - OMICS-derived targets for inflammatory gut disorders: opportunities for the
      development of nutrition related biomarkers.
PG  - 271-87
AB  - Modern molecular nutrition focuses on health promotion, disease prevention and
      performance improvement through diet. In analogy to Pharmacogenetics and
      -genomics, the disciplines "Nutrigenetics" and "Nutrigenomics" have evolved.
      Nutrigenetics asks how individual genetic disposition, manifesting as
      single-nucleotide- and copy-number polymorphisms as well as epigenetic
      regulation, affects susceptibility to diet. Nutrigenomics addresses the inverse
      relationship, i.e. how diet influences gene transcription, protein expression and
      metabolism. The long-term objective of Nutrigenomics is personalised nutrition
      for maintenance and improvement of individual health and for disease prevention. 
      Transcriptomics can put Proteomics- and Metabonomics-derived markers into a
      larger biological perspective. Metabonomics is a diagnostic tool for metabolic
      classification of individuals with the asset of quantitative, non-invasive
      analysis of easily accessible human body fluids such as urine, blood and saliva. 
      This feature also applies to some extent to Proteomics, with the constraint that 
      the latter discipline is more complex in terms of composition and dynamic range
      of the sample. Apart from addressing the most complex "Ome", Proteomics
      represents the only platform that delivers not only markers for disposition and
      efficacy but also targets of intervention. Application of integrated Omic
      technologies will drive the understanding of interrelated pathways in healthy and
      pathological conditions and will help to define molecular 'switchboards',
      necessary to develop disease related biomarkers. This will contribute to the
      development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for both pharmacological
      and nutritional interventions. This paper reviews inflammatory gut disorders, the
      state-of-the-art of the three Omics platforms and discusses the implication of
      the latter in biomarker revelation for nutritionally actionable inflammatory
      disorders in the intestine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects
      for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND 
      METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in
      gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases.
      RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular
      probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
      rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for
      irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's
      disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these
      patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies
      that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required.
      The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human
      trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation
      of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may
      have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the
      functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select
      disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed
      placebo-controlled studies.

TI  - Doctor, my son is so tired... about a case of hereditary fructose intolerance.
PG  - 456-9
AB  - We present the case of a 17-year-old male who was diagnosed at birth with
      hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). The patient complained of morning-time
      asthenia and post-prandial drowsiness despite a correct sleep pattern. The
      physical examination and biological check-up only showed severe vitamin C
      deficiency (<10 mol/l; normal range: 26-84). The patient's tiredness was
      attributed to this vitamin C deficiency, which is a frequent side-affect of the
      fructose-free diet. A change in diet associated with a supplementation in vitamin
      C was advised, with an increase in vegetable intake, principally avoiding
      carrots, onions, leaks and tinned sweet-corn. This case offers the opportunity
      for a review of this rare disease. Two kinds of fructose metabolism disorders
      (both autosomal recessive) are recognized: 1) essential fructosuria caused by a
      deficiency of fructokinase, which has no clinical consequence and requires no
      dietary treatment; 2) HFI, linked to three main mutations identified in aldolase 
      B gene that may be confirmed by fructose breath test, intravenous fructose
      tolerance test, and genetic testing. In HFI, fructose ingestion generally induces
      gastro-intestinal (nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, meteorism) and
      hypoglycemic symptoms. Fasting is well tolerated. If the condition remains
      undiagnosed, it leads to liver disease with hepatomegaly, proximal tubular
      dysfunction, and slow growth and weight gain. In conclusion, endocrinologists
      should be aware of this rare metabolic disease in order to provide careful
      follow-up, particularly important when the patient reaches adulthood. Moreover,
      hypoglycemia induced by fructose absorption, unexplained liver disease, irritable
      bowel syndrome or familial gout in an adult is suggestive of the diagnosis.

TI  - [The therapeutic effects of eliminating allergic foods according to food-specific
      IgG antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 641-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      by eliminating the allergic foods according to food-specific IgG antibodies and
      to clarify the etiopathological role and mechanism of food allergy. METHODS: The 
      food-specific IgG antibodies to a panel of 14 different food antigens in serum
      were detected with ELISA in fifty five cases with diarrhea-dominant IBS, thirty
      two with constipation-dominant IBS and eighteen normal controls. The frequency
      and severity index of symptoms and scores of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of 
      Life (IBS-QOL) in thirty five cases with positive food-specific IgG were observed
      before and after elimination of allergic foods for two months. RESULTS: The
      positive rate of serum food-specific IgG antibodies was 63.6 percent in patients 
      with diarrhea-dominant IBS and 43.8 percent in constipation-dominant IBS. Both
      were higher than that in normal controls. After eliminating allergic foods for
      four weeks according to the levels of serum food-specific IgG antibodies, the
      frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79 +/- 1.58) to (1.67 +/- 0.70) per week 
      and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.52 +/- 0.67 with significant
      differences. After eight weeks, the frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79
      +/- 1.58) to (1.53 +/- 0.69) per week and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.45
      +/- 0.66, also with significant differences. After eliminating allergic foods,
      the overall health score and the eight dimensionality integrals of QOL except
      avoiding food in patients with IBS increased significantly than those before
      treatment. At the end of eight weeks, the symptoms relieved completely in 31.4
      percent of the cases and remarkably in 34.3 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal immune
      reactions mediated by IgG antibodies coexisted in patients with IBS. It is of
      great significance in treating IBS by eliminating the allergic foods according to
      the serum level of food-specific IgG antibodies.

TI  - Review article: lactose intolerance in clinical practice--myths and realities.
PG  - 93-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of the world population has hypolactasia, which
      often remains undiagnosed and has the potential to cause some morbidity. However,
      not everyone has lactose intolerance, as several nutritional and genetic factors 
      influence tolerance. AIMS: To review current clinical practice and identify
      published literature on the management of lactose intolerance. METHODS: PubMed
      was searched using the terms lactose, lactase and diet to find original research 
      and reviews. Relevant articles and clinical experience provided the basis for
      this review. RESULTS: Lactose is found only in mammalian milk and is hydrolysed
      by lactase in the small intestine. The lactase gene has recently been identified.
      'Wild-type' is characterized by lactase nonpersistence, often leading to lactose 
      intolerance. Two genetic polymorphisms responsible for persistence have been
      identified, with their distribution concentrated in north Europeans. Symptoms of 
      lactose intolerance include abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea.
      Diagnosis is most commonly by the lactose hydrogen breath test. However, most
      people with hypolactasia, if given appropriate advice, can tolerate some
      lactose-containing foods without symptoms. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, some
      people with lactose intolerance can consume milk and dairy foods without
      developing symptoms, whereas others will need lactose restriction.

TI  - Hypnotherapy for children with functional abdominal pain or irritable bowel
      syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1430-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) are highly prevalent in childhood. A substantial proportion of patients
      continues to experience long-lasting symptoms. Gut-directed hypnotherapy (HT) has
      been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of adult IBS patients. We
      undertook a randomized controlled trial and compared clinical effectiveness of HT
      with standard medical therapy (SMT) in children with FAP or IBS. METHODS:
      Fifty-three pediatric patients, age 8-18 years, with FAP (n = 31) or IBS (n =
      22), were randomized to either HT or SMT. Hypnotherapy consisted of 6 sessions
      over a 3-month period. Patients in the SMT group received standard medical care
      and 6 sessions of supportive therapy. Pain intensity, pain frequency, and
      associated symptoms were scored in weekly standardized abdominal pain diaries at 
      baseline, during therapy, and 6 and 12 months after therapy. RESULTS: Pain scores
      decreased significantly in both groups: from baseline to 1 year follow-up, pain
      intensity scores decreased in the HT group from 13.5 to 1.3 and in the SMT group 
      from 14.1 to 8.0. Pain frequency scores decreased from 13.5 to 1.1 in the HT
      group and from 14.4 to 9.3 in the SMT group. Hypnotherapy was highly superior,
      with a significantly greater reduction in pain scores compared with SMT (P <
      .001). At 1 year follow-up, successful treatment was accomplished in 85% of the
      HT group and 25% of the SMT group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Gut-directed HT is
      highly effective in the treatment of children with longstanding FAP or IBS.

TI  - Elevated motility-related transmucosal potential difference in the upper small
      intestine in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 812-20
AB  - The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is complex and incompletely
      known. Very little has been studied regarding the role of submucous neuronal
      activity. We therefore measured small intestinal transmural potential difference 
      (PD, reflecting mainly electrogenic chloride secretion), and its linkage with
      fasting motor activity [migrating motor complex (MMC)] in controls (n = 16) and
      patients with IBS [n = 23, 14 diarrhoea predominant (d-IBS) and nine constipation
      predominant (c-IBS)]. Transmural-PD and its relation to MMC phase III was
      measured by modified multilumen manometry for 3 h in the fasting state using one 
      jejunal and one duodenal infusion line as flowing electrodes. The amplitude and
      duration of motor phase III was similar in controls and IBS patients, but the
      propagation speed of phase III was higher in IBS patients. In IBS patients,
      maximal PD during MMC phase III was significantly elevated in both the duodenum
      and jejunum (P < 0.05) and the PD decline after phase III was significantly
      prolonged in the jejunum (P < 0.01). The PD elevation was seen in both duodenum
      and jejunum in d-IBS patients, but only in the jejunum in the c-IBS patients. On 
      the basis of previous modelling studies, we propose that the enhanced secretion
      may reflect disturbed enteric network behaviour in some patients with IBS.

TI  - Fiber and colorectal diseases: separating fact from fiction.
PG  - 4161-7
AB  - Whilst fruits and vegetables are an essential part of our dietary intake, the
      role of fiber in the prevention of colorectal diseases remains controversial. The
      main feature of a high-fiber diet is its poor digestibility. Soluble fiber like
      pectins, guar and ispaghula produce viscous solutions in the gastrointestinal
      tract delaying small bowel absorption and transit. Insoluble fiber, on the other 
      hand, pass largely unaltered through the gut. The more fiber is ingested, the
      more stools will have to be passed. Fermentation in the intestines results in
      build up of large amounts of gases in the colon. This article reviews the
      physiology of ingestion of fiber and defecation. It also looks into the impact of
      dietary fiber on various colorectal diseases. A strong case cannot be made for a 
      protective effect of dietary fiber against colorectal polyp or cancer. Neither
      has fiber been found to be useful in chronic constipation and irritable bowel
      syndrome. It is also not useful in the treatment of perianal conditions. The
      fiber deficit - diverticulosis theory should also be challenged. The authors urge
      clinicians to keep an open mind about fiber. One must be aware of the truths and 
      myths about fiber before recommending it.

TI  - [Serum serotonin concentration and urine 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 366-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Serotonin (5-HT) is among other factors involved in gastrointestinal 
      motility, secretion and visceral sensation. Available data suggest that secretion
      and metabolism of 5-HT may be disturbed in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      Interpretation of these observations have been hampered by the variable
      methodology used and small numbers of patients involved in the previous studies. 
      Aim of this study was to measure serum 5-TH concentration under fasting condition
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), compared with controls (K). The 
      metabolite of serotonine--5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine was also 
      assessed. METHODS: 71 subjects, aged 19-50 years were included in this study.
      Three groups were distinguished: group I (n=25)--healthy volunteers, group II
      (n=23)--patients with constipation predominant (IBS-C), group Ill
      (n=23)--subjects with diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). IBS 
      was diagnosed according to Rome Ill Criteria. On the day of the experiment,
      patients received a standard meal (Nutridrink 6 x 300 kcal) and blood samples
      were collected during fasting. 5-HIAA concentration was determined in 24-hour
      urine collection. Concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA was measured by immunoenzyme
      ELISA method employing standard kits IBL nr RE59121 i RE59131 and Labsystems
      Multiscan detector. RESULTS: The average serotonin concentration during fasting
      was found in group I--156.67 +/- 49.12 ng/ml, in group II--221.73 +/- 91.56 ng/ml
      (p < 0.05), in group III--3.50 +/- 1.71 mg/24h. 5- HIAA concentration in urine
      was decreased in group Ill--3.50 +/- 1.71 mg/24 hrs (p < 0.05) and group II--4.37
      +/- 2.95 mg/24 hrs compared with healthy volunteers--5.65 +/- 2.31 mg/24 hrs.
      CONCLUSION: (1) Serotonin concentration is increased in C-IBS and D-IBS patients.
      (2) Urine 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion is decreased in IBS-subjects. (3)
      Disturbed metabolism of serotonin probably may play role in pathogenesis of
      functional bowel diseases.

TI  - Effect of gluten-free diet and co-morbidity of irritable bowel syndrome-type
      symptoms on health-related quality of life in adult coeliac patients.
PG  - 824-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both coeliac disease and irritable bowel syndrome show impaired
      health-related quality of life, however, the impact of irritable bowel
      syndrome-type symptoms on health-related quality of life in coeliac disease is
      unclear. AIM: To evaluate the effect of gluten-free diet adherence and irritable 
      bowel syndrome-type symptoms co-morbidity on health-related quality of life in
      adult coeliac disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1130 adults were
      enrolled in the study comprising 1001 controls from the general population and
      129 diagnosed coeliac disease patients from the University Clinic in Cagliari.
      Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms and health-related quality of life were
      assessed using the Rome II and the SF-36 questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS:
      Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms prevalence in controls was 10.1%
      (102/1001) and 55% (71/129) in the coeliac disease patients. Irritable bowel
      syndrome-type symptom controls and coeliac disease patients both presented
      significantly lower health-related quality of life (p<or=0.05) compared to
      healthy controls. Strict diet coeliac disease patients, compared to partial diet 
      patients, showed significantly (p<or=0.05) better scores in all domains, except
      physical functioning, physical-role and bodily pain. The lowest scores were found
      in partial diet coeliac disease patients with irritable bowel syndrome-type
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The present results confirm the burden of irritable bowel 
      syndrome-type symptoms and coeliac disease on health-related quality of life.
      Moreover, these data show that health-related quality of life in coeliac disease 
      is impaired by poor compliance and by co-morbidity with irritable bowel
      syndrome-type symptoms.

TI  - Recto-colonic reflex is impaired in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 653-9
AB  - Motor and sensory dysfunction of the gut are present in a subset of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of 
      a recto-colonic inhibitory reflex in healthy humans. It is not known whether this
      reflex exists in IBS. We studied rectal compliance, perception and the
      recto-colonic reflex by measuring volume responses of the descending colon to
      rectal distentions by barostat in 26 IBS patients and 13 healthy controls under
      both fasting and postprandial conditions. In the fasting state, rectal distention
      inhibited colonic tone and phasic motility to a similar extent in health and IBS.
      After a meal, rectal distention inhibited colonic tone and phasic motility to a
      lesser degree (P < 0.05) in IBS than health. Under postprandial but not fasting
      conditions, rectal distentions of increasing intensity were associated with
      higher pain scores in IBS than in health. Rectal distention inhibits tonic and
      phasic motility of the descending colon in healthy controls and in IBS patients. 
      Postprandially this recto-colonic inhibitory reflex is impaired and attenuated in
      IBS patients compared with controls. These findings point to an altered reflex
      function in IBS and have implications for pathophysiology and therapy.

TI  - Clinical onset of celiac disease after an episode of Campylobacter jejuni
      enteritis.
PG  - 453-5
AB  - The present report describes a young woman with no previous gastrointestinal
      complaints who was initially diagnosed with postinfective irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) after a confirmed case of Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. However,
      because of persistent diarrhea, new-onset bloating and the development of iron
      and vitamin deficiencies, serological markers for celiac disease (CD) were
      evaluated. A positive tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibody test and 
      repeat endoscopy with duodenal biopsy showing a Marsh IIIa lesion confirmed the
      diagnosis of CD. Infectious gastroenteritis is a well-established risk factor for
      the development of IBS, and there is recent evidence that it could play a role in
      the initiation and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The present case
      suggests that the clinical expression of CD can be unmasked by an acute
      gastrointestinal infection and supports the hypothesis that environmental factors
      other than gliadin may play a role in the clinical onset of CD in a genetically
      susceptible host. The increasing availability of serological testing and upper
      endoscopy has led to increasingly frequent diagnoses of CD and recognition that
      it may mimic IBS. The present case findings suggest that CD should be considered 
      in the differential diagnosis of persistent IBS-like symptoms after an episode of
      infectious gastroenteritis.

TI  - Nuances in treating irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a difficult disease to treat because of its
      ill-defined triggers, variable clinical course, and unpredictable myriad of
      symptoms of varying severity. Both doctors and patients are frustrated by the
      insidious nature of IBS--a nonlethal disorder that destroys lives, relationships,
      and careers. Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but
      are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A
      combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and
      therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms
      characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients
      with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved
      serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS
      and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although 
      they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target
      normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients
      in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing
      pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy. Overall, treatment
      approaches for IBS should address multisymptom relief and improvement of overall 
      patient well-being.

TI  - Chronic abdominal pain associated with intermittent compression of the celiac
      artery.
PG  - 209-13
AB  - Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), surely one of the most frequent causes of medical
      intervention, is frequently present in many gastrointestinal disease. Usually no 
      structural and/or biochemical alterations can be demonstrated. This condition is,
      therefore, considered to be due to functional disorders such as irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia. Previous observations suggest the
      presence of a rare alteration of celiac vessels among the possible causes of RAP.
      This pathological condition was known as Dunbar syndrome. We report 2 cases of
      chronic abdominal pain. The former reported weight loss and the latter anemia
      with iron deficiency. It is remarkable that patients with initial diagnosis of
      IBS can be affected by celiac disease (CD), which is the cause of their abdominal
      pain. Our patients were tested for CD; the former was negative and IBS was
      diagnosed, the latter was positive and a gluten free diet was prescribed. The
      presence of an epigastric bruit, accentuated during expiration, suggested a
      possible vascular alteration known as tripod celiac artery compression syndrome. 
      Duplex Doppler sonography suggests the diagnosis of celiac arterial constriction 
      due the diaphragmatic ligament. These cases show that tripod celiac artery
      compression syndrome might be a cause of RAP and that it may be evaluated and
      investigated when the clinical examination discloses an abdominal systolic bruit.

TI  - Predictors of clinical response to gluten-free diet in patients diagnosed with
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 844-50; quiz 769
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten sensitivity might cause abdominal symptoms in the
      absence of villous atrophy. We examined the prevalence of celiac
      disease-associated serum antibodies in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome
      (d-IBS) patients and their efficacy in combination with HLA-DQ2 expression to
      predict the response to gluten-free diet. METHODS: HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201
      expression and celiac disease-associated IgA and IgG serum antibodies against
      gliadin and tissue-transglutaminase were measured in 145 patients with d-IBS, 74 
      patients with untreated and treated celiac disease, and 57 patients with active
      IBD. Follow-up antibody levels, stool frequency, and gastrointestinal symptom
      scores were determined in 41 d-IBS patients (26 women, 15 men; median age, 46
      years, range, 30-67 years) who participated in a nonrandomized evaluation of 6
      months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Increased celiac disease-associated serum
      IgG, but not IgA, was found in the majority of patients with treated (55%) as in 
      most patients with untreated celiac disease (97%). In d-IBS patients, celiac
      disease-associated serum IgG antibodies (37%) and HLA-DQ2 expression (39%) were
      more frequent than in IBD patients (18% and 23%, respectively). After 6 months of
      gluten-free diet, stool frequency and gastrointestinal symptom score returned to 
      normal values in 60% of d-IBS patients who were positive and in 12% who were
      negative for HLA-DQ2 and celiac disease-associated serum IgG; both parameters
      combined yielded positive and negative predictive values of 56% (95% confidence
      interval, 30%-80%) and 88% (69%-97%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac
      disease-associated serum IgG and HLA-DQ2 expression can identify likely
      responders to gluten-free diet in d-IBS patients.

TI  - Sigmoid-colonic motility in health and irritable bowel syndrome: a role for
      5-hydroxytryptamine.
PG  - 724-31
AB  - Abstract Evidence suggests that sigmoid-colonic motility is increased in patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) plays a role in
      the control of motility, but its involvement in the dysmotility seen in IBS
      remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between platelet depleted plasma
      5-HT (PDP 5-HT) concentration and sigmoid-colonic motility in patients with IBS
      and healthy volunteers. Pre- and postprandial PDP 5-HT concentrations were
      assessed while recording sigmoid-colonic motility in 35 IBS patients (aged 19-53 
      years, eight male) and 16 healthy volunteers (aged 18-39 years, six male).
      Motility was recorded using a five-channel solid-state catheter introduced to a
      depth of 35 cm into an unprepared bowel. 5-Hydroxytryptamine concentration was
      measured by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorimetric detection. Irritable bowel
      syndrome patients had elevated concentrations of PDP 5-HT under fasting (P <
      0.004) and fed (P = 0.079) conditions compared with controls. Likewise, they
      exhibited increased sigmoid-colonic motility under fasting (activity index: P <
      0.02) and fed (P < 0.05) conditions compared with controls. Platelet depleted
      plasma 5-HT concentration positively correlated with colonic activity index under
      both fasting (r = 0.402; P = 0.003) and fed (r = 0.439; P = 0.001) conditions.
      These data show a possible relationship between endogenous concentrations of 5-HT
      and sigmoid-colonic motility recorded in both IBS and healthy subjects.

TI  - Seeking control through the determination of diet: a qualitative investigation of
      women with irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 152-60
AB  - PURPOSE: The overall objective of this investigation was to study the lived
      experience, in relation to diet, of women who have been diagnosed with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This study
      specifically explored pre-illness and postdiagnosis dietary patterns of
      participants with an emphasis on the changes, if any, that participants had made 
      to their diet. METHODS: This study took place on a university campus in
      southwestern Ontario, Canada. Eight women between the ages of 18 and 23 years
      were recruited. Participants completed a consent form, background questionnaire, 
      and a 14-day food diary. Participant also engaged in one-on-one semistructured
      interviews that consisted of 8 open-ended questions aimed at gaining a thorough
      understanding of the lived experience of these women, with respect to their
      dietary practices. RESULTS: The 3 major themes identified included: control;
      family and friend support; and adverse behaviors. The salient theme of control
      included the subthemes timing and awareness of surroundings, giving into
      temptations, and determination of diet. Determining one's diet, the subtheme that
      is addressed in this article, involved several key elements, including (1) the
      role of the physician(s), (2) experimentation, (3) seeking information, and (4)
      food modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Diet was the primary behavioral factor
      manipulated by participants to manage their conditions. The determination of
      potential trigger foods/beverages, however, entailed an often frustrating process
      of trial and error, in which few of the women received assistance from primary
      healthcare professionals. As a result, many of the women sought dietary
      information from alternate sources, some of which may not provide reliable
      information. Through experimentation and, for some, the documentation of food
      intake and symptom production, all participants identified food/beverage items
      they believed to cause symptom development. Although similar items were
      identified by many, all participants had individual triggers and sensitivities.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].
PG  - 1619-26
AB  - Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for
      this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate 
      drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is
      impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for
      reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. 
      Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory 
      proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify
      treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral
      hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low
      doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists
      (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists
      (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis
      and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy,
      relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a
      possible treatment in the future.

TI  - [Breath hydrogen levels do not predict fiber intolerance in irritable bowel
      syndrome with constipation].
PG  - 15-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is characterized by the worsening of
      symptoms with a high fiber diet. This intolerance could be related to an increase
      in colonic bacterial fermentation. The hydrogen breath test (HBT) is a marker of 
      the intestinal micro flora fermentative capacity. AIM: To assess if there is an
      association between hydrogen (H2) levels and clinical changes between diets with 
      and without bran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 women with predominantly constipated
      irritable bowel syndrome (Rome II criteria) received a lowfiber diet during one
      week. This phase was followed by a second 7 day period with the same diet but
      supplemented with 12 g of crude dietary fiber. At the end of both periods,
      patients completed a symptom scale (Lickert type) and performed a HBT. RESULTS:
      Comparing both periods with a different diet the median difference in the
      clinical scale score (-2.5) shows a tendency favorable to the diet without bran, 
      p = 0.048. In the fiber period the median increase of 2 ppm in H2 values was not 
      significant deferent. Neither was possible to establish an association between
      breath H2 and the clinical response to a fiber diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot
      study we could not detect ary association between breath H2 levels and the
      clinical response to dietary fiber.

TI  - Predictors of irritable bowel-type symptoms and healthcare-seeking behavior among
      adults with celiac disease.
PG  - 370-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type
      symptoms and consecutive healthcare-seeking behavior, their impact on
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and their possible biopsychosocial
      determinants in adult patients with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 1000
      adult patients with CD from the German Celiac Society completed a medical
      (including bowel) and a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Short Form Health
      Survey (SF-36), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale through a postal
      survey. RESULTS: Of 412 respondents with reported biopsy-proven diagnosis with
      major adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for > or =1 year, 96 (23.3%) patients
      fulfilled the modified Rome I criteria for IBS. Of these 96 patients, 76 (79.2%) 
      sought help (medical and/or nonmedical) due to bowel symptoms (referred to as
      patients with IBS). IBS-type symptoms had a significant negative impact on the
      physical summary score of the SF-36 (p = .05). Mental disorder (OR = 2.29; beta =
      0.83; p = .006); female sex (OR = 2.34; beta = 0.85; p = .03), and occasional
      nonadherence to GFD (OR = 1.74; beta = 0.56; p = .05) were risk factors for
      IBS-type symptoms. Active medical comorbidities predicted IBS-patient status (OR 
      = 0.40; beta = -0.92; p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The data support the
      biopsychosocial model of IBS: IBS-type symptoms in adult patients with CD can be 
      explained through an interaction of clinical and sociopsychological mechanisms.

TI  - Risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome in Turkish population: role of food
      allergy.
PG  - 380-3
AB  - GOALS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of food
      hypersensitivity in Turkish patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      BACKGROUND: The IBS is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract
      characterized by abdominal pain, distension, meteorism and either diarrhea or
      constipation. The role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS remains controversial. 
      Many investigators have shown that individual foods can trigger symptoms in some 
      patients; nevertheless, the percentage of patients that benefit from dietary
      manipulation ranges from 15% to 67% in different reports. STUDY: Skin prick test 
      to 11 common allergens, total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein and eosinophil
      counts were evaluated in 100 patients satisfying the Rome II criteria and
      compared with 25 healthy controls. The history and physical examination of the
      groups were recorded and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories were performed. 
      RESULTS: One hundred patients were entered into the study with a mean age of
      45.63+/-12.91 years. Of the patients 53 had constipation predominant, 19 had
      diarrhea predominant, and 28 had alternating type IBS. Skin prick tests
      positivity were more common among the IBS patients in comparison with controls
      (25% and 1%, respectively, P<0.05). Mean IgE values were higher in patients than 
      controls (70.83+/-66.05 and 15.20+/-14.01 IU/mL, respectively, P<0.000).
      Eosinophilic cationic protein values were also higher in IBS patients than
      controls (16.75+/-11.28 and 11.56+/-4.72, respectively, P<0.05) Evaluation of
      Beck Depression Inventory showed that tendency to depression in patients with IBS
      was 38% and 4% in controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, in
      patients complaining of IBS it is of importance to search for a food component.
      Clinical improvements can be observed after the introduction of an adequate
      exclusion diet.

TI  - Effects of a cannabinoid receptor agonist on colonic motor and sensory functions 
      in humans: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - G137-45
AB  - Cannabinoid receptors (CBR) are located on cholinergic neurons in the brain stem,
      stomach, and colon. CBR stimulation inhibits motility in rodents. Effects in
      humans are unclear. Dronabinol (DRO), a nonselective CBR agonist, inhibits
      colonic motility and sensation. The aim of this study was to compare effects of
      DRO and placebo (PLA) on colonic motility and sensation in healthy volunteers.
      Fifty-two volunteers were randomly assigned (double-blind) to a single dose of
      7.5 mg DRO or PLA postoperative with concealed allocation. A balloon-manometric
      assembly placed into the descending colon allowed assessment of colonic
      compliance, motility, tone, and sensation before and 1 h after oral ingestion of 
      medication, and during fasting, and for 1 h after 1,000-kcal meal. There was an
      overall significant increase in colonic compliance (P = 0.045), a borderline
      effect of relaxation in fasting colonic tone (P = 0.096), inhibition of
      postprandial colonic tone (P = 0.048), and inhibition of fasting and postprandial
      phasic pressure (P = 0.008 and 0.030, respectively). While DRO did not
      significantly alter thresholds for first gas or pain sensation, there was an
      increase in sensory rating for pain during random phasic distensions at all
      pressures tested and in both genders (P = 0.024). In conclusion, in humans the
      nonselective CBR agonist, DRO, relaxes the colon and reduces postprandial colonic
      motility and tone. Increase in sensation ratings to distension in the presence of
      relaxation of the colon suggests central modulation of perception. The potential 
      for CBR to modulate colonic motor function in diarrheal disease such as irritable
      bowel syndrome deserves further study.

TI  - Etiologies and predictors of diagnosis in nonresponsive celiac disease.
PG  - 445-50
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD) is a common problem
      affecting from 7% to 30% of celiac patients. Because NRCD comprises varied and
      potentially morbid entities, efficient and cost-effective patient care requires
      knowledge of the specific causes of this disorder. The aim of this study was to
      determine the common etiologies of NRCD in a tertiary referral center. METHODS:
      All cases of biopsy examination-proven celiac disease (CD) seen at our
      institution over the preceding 5 years were included in this study. NRCD was
      defined as a failure to respond to at least 6 months of treatment with a
      gluten-free diet or the re-emergence of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities
      typical of CD while still on treatment with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total 
      of 113 patients with NRCD meeting the earlier-described criteria were seen from a
      total of 603 patients with CD (19%), however, among patients for whom we provided
      primary specialist care the incidence of NRCD was 10% (P < .001). Gluten exposure
      was the most common cause of NRCD (36%), followed by irritable bowel syndrome
      (22%), refractory CD (10%), lactose intolerance (8%), and microscopic colitis
      (6%). The mean immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase level in the
      gluten-exposed group was 67 vs 17 U/mL (normal, <20) for other diagnoses (P <
      .05). Weight loss and male sex were highly predictive of refractory CD (P < .05
      and < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: NRCD is a common phenomenon affecting
      10%-19% of celiac patients. A limited number of etiologies account for the
      majority of cases. Clinical factors may be used to guide evaluation.

TI  - [Pre- and probiotics].
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to
      provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated
      actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological
      system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the
      scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very 
      active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut
      microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism.
      Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short
      chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are
      necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen
      bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the
      intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre-
      and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and
      probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added.
      Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of
      antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future 
      studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the
      evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies
      of adequate duration.

TI  - The Canadian Celiac Health Survey.
PG  - 1087-95
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the diagnostic process, frequency
      of associated disorders, family history, and impact of a gluten-free diet in
      individuals with celiac disease. All members of the Canadian Celiac Association
      (n=5240) were surveyed with a questionnaire. Respondents included 2681 adults
      with biopsy-proven celiac disease. The mean age was 56 years. Most common
      presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (83%), diarrhea (76%), and weight
      loss (69%). The mean delay in diagnosis was 11.7 years. Diagnoses made prior to
      celiac disease included anemia (40%), stress (31%), and irritable bowel syndrome 
      (29%). Osteoporosis was common. Prior to diagnosis, 27% of respondents consulted 
      three or more doctors about their symptoms. Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease
      remain a problem. Associated medical conditions occur frequently. More accurate
      food labeling is needed. Improved awareness of celiac disease and greater use of 
      serological screening tests may result in earlier diagnosis and reduced risk of
      associated conditions.

TI  - A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Lactobacillus GG for
      abdominal pain disorders in children.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are common in school-aged 
      children; however, there is no reliable treatment. AIM: To determine the efficacy
      of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A
      total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia
      (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were 
      enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received
      LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study
      population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no
      pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6,
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI:
      4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely
      to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3,
      95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02),
      but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n =
      47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately
      increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.

TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in outpatients with inflammatory bowel
      disease using a food and beverage intolerance, food and beverage avoidance diet.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the outpatient with chronic inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD) is a difficult but important challenge to recognize and treat. It
      is very helpful to have effective treatment approaches for IBS that are practical
      and use minimal medications. Because of the underlying chronic inflammation in
      IBD, IBS symptoms occur with increased frequency and severity, secondary to
      increased hypersensitivity to foods and beverages that stimulate the
      gastrointestinal tract. This paper discusses how to treat IBS in the IBD
      outpatient, with emphasis on using a food and beverage intolerance, avoidance
      diet. The adverse effects of many foods and beverages are amount dependent and
      can be delayed, additive, and cumulative. The specific types of foods and
      beverages that can induce IBS symptoms include milk and milk containing products;
      caffeine containing products; alcoholic beverages; fruits; fruit juices; spices; 
      seasonings; diet beverages; diet foods; diet candies; diet gum; fast foods;
      condiments; fried foods; fatty foods; multigrain breads; sourdough breads;
      bagels; salads; salad dressings; vegetables; beans; red meats; gravies; spaghetti
      sauce; stews; nuts; popcorn; high fiber; and cookies, crackers, pretzels, cakes, 
      and pies. The types of foods and beverages that are better tolerated include
      water; rice; plain pasta or noodles; baked or broiled potatoes; white breads;
      plain fish, chicken, turkey, or ham; eggs; dry cereals; soy or rice based
      products; peas; applesauce; cantaloupe; watermelon; fruit cocktail; margarine;
      jams; jellies; and peanut butter. Handouts that were developed based upon what
      worsens or helps IBS symptoms in patients are included to help patients learn
      which foods and beverages to avoid and which are better tolerated.
