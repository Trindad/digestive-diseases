TI  - Current level of consensus on probiotic science--report of an expert
      meeting--London, 23 November 2009.
PG  - 436-9
LID - 10.4161/gmic.1.6.13610 [doi]
AB  - The present paper summarizes the consensus views of a group of 9 European
      clinicians and scientists on the current state of scientific knowledge on
      probiotics, covering those areas where there is substantial evidence for
      beneficial effects and those where the evidence base is poor or inconsistent.
      There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain 
      specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the 
      incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile
      infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in
      irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can 
      reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature
      infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other
      clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel
      disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori 
      adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.

TI  - [Effect of Weichang'an pill on intestinal digestion enzymes and the AQP4
      concentration in proximal colon in IBS-D rats].
PG  - 2899-903
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of Weichang'an pill on the treatment of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) in model rats. METHOD:
      Animal model of compound diarrhea was induced by a lactose enriched diet in the
      Wistar rat, combining with restraint stress. Twenty four female Wistar rats were 
      randomly divided into normal group, model group and 60 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)
      Weichang'an pill group. The rate of weight increase, the incubation period of
      diarrhea and the diarrhea index were observed. Then 45 female Wistar rats
      randomly divided into five groups: control group, model group and Weichang'an
      pill groups of high, medium and low doses (80, 60, 40 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). The
      indexes of thymus and spleen were calculated. The activities of LDH, MDH and
      disaccharidase in intestinal organization were inspected. Serum D-xylose content 
      and the AQP4 concentration in proximal colon were detected. RESULT: After taking 
      Weichang'an pill for 4 days, the rate of weight increase in Weichang'an pill
      group was higher than the model group's. While the rate of diarrhea was lower
      significantly. So the best cycle of taking medicine was 4 days. The indexes of
      thymus and spleen of model group were decreased than that of control group. And
      the activities of LDH, MDH and disaccharidase in intestinal organization were
      also decreased. But the AQP4 concentration in proximal colon was increased.
      Compared with the model group, the indexes of thymus and spleen increased
      remarkably in the group of medium doses. Meanwhile, the activities of LDH, MDH
      and disaccharidase increased. But the AQP4 concentration didn't change.
      CONCLUSION: Weichang'an pill has the effect of antidiarrhea. It can adjust the
      sugar's catabolism through increasing the activity of intestinal digestive
      ferment.

AB  - Acute abdominal pain caused by perforation, intestinal lymphoma or
      intussusception is an uncommon manifestation in adult celiac disease. We report a
      49 year-old female with history of irritable bowel syndrome and osteoporosis
      consulting for acute abdominal pain and severe abdominal distention. Abdominal CT
      scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a jejunal intussusception and other
      radiological alterations that suggested the possibility of celiac disease.
      Serological antibodies (endomysial and transglutaminase antibodies), endoscopy
      and the pathological study of duodenal biopsies confirmed the diagnosis. With a
      gluten free diet, the patient remains asymptomatic.

TI  - Kiwifruit improves bowel function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with 
      constipation.
PG  - 451-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder of the
      gastrointestinal system, and is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea
      (IBS/D), constipation (IBS/C), and alternating diarrhea and constipation
      (IBSC/A). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week
      kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C.
      Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. 
      All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a
      baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a
      post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults
      consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4
      weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per
      day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and
      following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation
      records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly
      increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05).
      Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that
      consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4
      weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves
      bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.

TI  - Diet, disease activity, and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1007/s10067-010-1625-x [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate, firstly, the relationship between
      diet and disease activity and, secondly, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and their relationship to diet among patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) using a cross-sectional design. One hundred sixty-five
      individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal
      questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal 
      symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., 
      the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation
      between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients
      reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain
      foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal
      pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status
      according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively).
      Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher
      consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured
      milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In
      multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were
      independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To
      conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and
      disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between
      diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be
      prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.

TI  - A cross-cultural perspective on irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 707-12
LID - 10.1002/msj.20218 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal illness, defined by
      symptoms. Irritable bowel syndrome has been described as a biopsychosocial
      condition, in which colonic dysfunction is affected by psychological and social
      factors. As a result of this unusual constellation, irritable bowel syndrome may 
      be subject to cultural variables that differ in different parts of the globe. In 
      this article, we describe some of the ways in which irritable bowel syndrome may 
      be experienced differently, depending on local belief systems, psychological
      pressures, acceptance or resistance to a mind-body paradigm, and breakdown in
      support or relationship structure. Examples are given in which irritable bowel
      syndrome investigators from countries around the world describe various aspects
      of the syndrome that may affect the illness experience of their patients. We
      describe our own research studies that have demonstrated possible adverse effects
      on disease severity from relationship conflict, attribution of symptoms to
      physical rather than emotional cause, and the belief that irritable bowel
      syndrome is enduring and mysterious. Also described is our finding that symptom
      patterns may differ significantly between different geographic locations.
      Finally, we discuss the importance of "cultural competence" on the part of
      healthcare professionals in regard to caring for patients of diverse cultural
      backgrounds.

LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-0467 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)
      relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or
      functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center.
      Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and
      received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry 
      and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal
      permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused 
      a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of
      abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up 
      (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved 
      in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P
      < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At
      entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability 
      test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of
      patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P <
      .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG
      significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children
      with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut
      barrier.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define functional gastrointestinal pain, irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS), levator ani syndrome, proctalgia fugax, the pathophysiology of these
      syndromes and the treatments that can be proposed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review
      of articles published on the theme based on a Medline (PubMed) search and
      consensus conferences selected according to their scientific relevance. RESULTS: 
      IBS is very common. Patients report abdominal pain and/or discomfort, bloating,
      and abnormal bowel habit (diarrhoea, constipation or both), in the absence of any
      structural or biochemical abnormalities. IBS has a complex, multifactorial
      pathophysiology, involving biological and psychosocial interactions resulting in 
      dysregulation of the brain-gut axis associated with disorders of intestinal
      motility, hyperalgesia, immune disorders and disorders of the intestinal
      bacterial microflora and autonomic and hormonal dysfunction. Many treatments have
      been proposed, ranging from diet to pharmacology and psychotherapy. DISCUSSION:
      Patients with various types of chronic pelvic and perineal pain, especially those
      seen in urology departments, very often report associated IBS. This syndrome is
      also part of a global and integrated concept of pelviperineal dysfunction,
      avoiding a rigorous distinction between the posterior segment and the midline and
      anterior segments of the perineum.

AB  - Irregularities of serotonin function in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be due
      to changes in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan. Dietary
      alteration of tryptophan intake may impact upon the mood and bowel symptoms of
      IBS. We hypothesized that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS)
      patients would exhibit an increase in plasma tryptophan due to alterations in
      tryptophan metabolism. We also hypothesized that a diet low in tryptophan would
      reverse this change and reduce symptoms. Thirteen patients with d-IBS had fasting
      serum free and total tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, and 6 kynurenine
      metabolites measured before and after 2 weeks of a strict dairy-free diet.
      Baseline tryptophan parameters were compared with an age- and sex-matched control
      group. Changes in the specific tryptophan parameters before and after dairy-free 
      diet were correlated with symptoms of IBS and mood. Compared with the control
      group, d-IBS patients at baseline exhibited significantly higher free serum
      tryptophan (10.5 +/- 4.35 vs 4.75 +/- 2.43 mumol/L [means +/- standard
      deviation], P = .006) and significantly lower tryptophan dioxygenase and total
      tryptophan oxidation as measured by the kynurenine to free tryptophan and total
      kynurenines to free tryptophan ratios (23.37 +/- 10.12 vs 55.33 +/- 16.02, P <
      .001 and 49.34 +/- 17.84 vs 258.46 +/- 98.67, P < .001, respectively). Dairy-free
      diet did not modulate metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or symptoms.
      Tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway is inhibited in d-IBS, and a
      dairy-free diet does not alter this. Our findings are consistent with possible
      enhanced serotonin activity in d-IBS.

AB  - The effects of a probiotic acidified milk product on the blood serum metabolite
      profile of patients suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) compared to a
      non-probiotic acidified milk product was investigated using (1)H NMR
      metabonomics. For eight weeks, IBS patients consumed 0.4 L per day of a probiotic
      fermented milk product or non-probiotic acidified milk. Both diets resulted in
      elevated levels of blood serum L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Our results
      showed identical effects of acidified milk consumption independent of probiotic
      addition. A similar result was previously obtained in a questionnaire-based
      evaluation of symptom relief. A specific probiotic effect is thus absent both in 
      the patient subjective symptom evaluations and at the blood serum metabolite
      level. However, there was no correspondence between symptom relief and metabolite
      response on the patient level.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disease during which the
      pathophysiological role of the gut microbiota has been recently highlighted. In
      almost 20% of the patients, IBS is clearly a post-infectious IBS as a consequence
      of an acute bacterial gastroenteritis. Some papers have reported an abnormal
      colonic fermentation in IBS patients that could explain symptoms such as bloating
      and be one of the factors triggering visceral hypersensitivity. More recently,
      significant differences in the composition of both the luminal and
      mucosa-associated microbiota have been reported between both IBS patients and
      healthy controls and IBS subgroups while some arguments exist for a small
      intestinal overgrowth in a subset of IBS patients. All these arguments for a
      deleterious role of the gut microbiota lead to the actual discuss to consider new
      therapeutic options, including mainly pre- and probiotics and maybe antibiotics.

TI  - The prevalence of celiac disease in patients fulfilling Rome III criteria for
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 389-92
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.06.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease shares several symptoms which constitute some
      of the ROME criteria used for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      and as such many patients with underlying Celiac disease may be mistakenly
      diagnosed as having IBS. The aim of the present study was to determine the
      prevalence of Celiac disease in patients with IBS fulfilling ROME III criteria.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who fulfilled ROME III criteria for irritable
      bowel syndrome were screened for Celiac disease using the Biocard(TM) Celiac
      Disease Stick test, and patients who tested positive had their serum samples
      analyzed for antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA
      antibodies. Patients with detectable antibody levels underwent endoscopic
      duodenal biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Celiac disease. RESULTS: Two of 100
      patients who were diagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome as per the Roma
      III criteria were found to have elevated levels of serum antigliadin IgA and IgG,
      and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies, with histological evidence of
      Celiac disease on examination of duodenal biopsy. Both patients were started on a
      gluten-free diet, showing significant improvement in their symptoms on follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a common finding among patients labeled as IBS.
      Celiac disease must be considered in differential diagnosis of IBS especially in 
      the therapy refractory group.

TI  - Coeliac disease in China, a field waiting for exploration.
PG  - 472-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: no systematic studies on the prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) have 
      been reported from China. In western populations CD is more common in patients
      with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in diarrhoea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). We have screened patients with these conditions
      presenting to the outpatient department of a large hospital of "Traditional
      Chinese Medicine" (TCM) in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, P.R. China. METHODS: we
      tested sera of 78 unrelated Han Chinese patients (5 IDDM and 73 D-IBS), using
      ELISA serological tests for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA) and IgA
      anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG). RESULTS: six out of 78
      patients (7.7%) were positive for IgG-AGA (two men and four women) and two (2.6%)
      were positive for IgA-tTGs. One of the latter patients was negative for IgG-AGA. 
      Besides, one patient had a dubious IgA-tTG antibody and a positive IgG-AGA. None 
      of the six patients agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Two out of these six
      patients followed a gluten-free diet for one year. In one patient the diarrhoea
      ceased and his body weight increased. Another stopped losing weight. CONCLUSIONS:
      this study previously published as a letter in GUT (Wu J, Xia B, von Blomberg
      BME, Zhao C, Yang XW, Crusius JBA, Pena AS. Coeliac disease: emerging in China?
      Gut 2010; 59(3): 418-9) demonstrated that CD may exist in the Jiangsu province of
      P.R. China. The present article draws attention to the difficulties of following 
      a standard protocol in China such as established in western countries and
      highlights important factors less well known in the west in relation to the
      development of CD in China. Wheat production became significant in China between 
      1600 and 1300 B.C. After the Han dynasty (500-200 B.C.), wheat was one of the
      main cereals in China. One the major wheat fields in China is located in the
      Jiangsu province where the research for this article was performed. A review of
      Chinese literature shows that the predominant HLA-DQ CD risk alleles and
      haplotypes are present in the Jiangsu province. Genetic background, food
      consumption, and the results of our study suggest that CD should actively be
      investigated in P.R. China.

TI  - Manipulation of dietary short chain carbohydrates alters the pattern of gas
      production and genesis of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1366-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06370.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (FODMAPs) in the diet reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In the 
      present study, we aimed to compare the patterns of breath hydrogen and methane
      and symptoms produced in response to diets that differed only in FODMAP content. 
      METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects and 15 with IBS (Rome III criteria) undertook a
      single-blind, crossover intervention trial involving consuming provided diets
      that were either low (9 g/day) or high (50 g/day) in FODMAPs for 2 days. Food and
      gastrointestinal symptom diaries were kept and breath samples collected hourly
      over 14 h on day 2 of each diet. RESULTS: Higher levels of breath hydrogen were
      produced over the entire day with the high FODMAP diet for healthy volunteers
      (181 +/- 77 ppm.14 h vs 43 +/- 18; mean +/- SD P < 0.0001) and patients with IBS 
      (242 +/- 79 vs 62 +/- 23; P < 0.0001), who had higher levels during each dietary 
      period than the controls (P < 0.05). Breath methane, produced by 10 subjects
      within each group, was reduced with the high FODMAP intake in healthy subjects
      (47 +/- 29 vs 109 +/- 77; P = 0.043), but was not different in patients with IBS 
      (126 +/- 153 vs 86 +/- 72). Gastrointestinal symptoms and lethargy were
      significantly induced by the high FODMAP diet in patients with IBS, while only
      increased flatus production was reported by healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dietary FODMAPs induce prolonged hydrogen production in the intestine that is
      greater in IBS, influence the amount of methane produced, and induce
      gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms experienced by patients with IBS. The
      results offer mechanisms underlying the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in IBS.

TI  - Effects of a 5-HT(3) antagonist, ondansetron, on fasting and postprandial small
      bowel water content assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 655-63
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04395.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-HT(3) antagonists have been shown to be effective in relieving the 
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D). Using a recently
      validated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, we have demonstrated reduced
      fasting small bowel water content (SBWC) in IBS-D associated with accelerated
      small bowel transit. We hypothesized that slowing of transit with ondansetron
      would lead to an increase in SBWC by inhibiting fasting motility. AIM: To assess 
      the effects of ondansetron compared with placebo in healthy volunteers on SBWC
      and motility in two different groups of subjects, one studied using MRI and
      another using manometry. METHODS: Healthy volunteers were given either a placebo 
      or ondansetron on the day prior to and on the study day. Sixteen volunteers
      underwent baseline fasting and postprandial MRI scans for 270 min. In a second
      study, a separate group of n = 18 volunteers were intubated and overnight
      migrating motor complex (MMC) recorded. Baseline MRI scans were carried out after
      the tube was removed. RESULTS: Fasting SBWC was markedly increased by ondansetron
      (P < 0.0007). Ondansetron reduced the overall antroduodenal Motility Index (P <
      0.04). The subjects who were intubated had significantly lower fasting SBWC (P < 
      0.0002) compared with the group of subjects who were not intubated. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The 5-HT(3) receptor antagonism increased fasting small bowel water. This was
      associated with reduced fasting antroduodenal Motility Index which may explain
      the clinical benefit of such drugs.

PG  - 635-43

AB  - Increased intestinal permeability is a likely cause of various pathologies, such 
      as allergies and metabolic or even cardiovascular disturbances. Intestinal
      permeability is found in many severe clinical situations and in common disorders 
      such as irritable bowel syndrome. In these conditions, substances that are
      normally unable to cross the epithelial barrier gain access to the systemic
      circulation. To illustrate the potential harmfulness of leaky gut, we present an 
      argument based on examples linked to protein or lipid glycation induced by modern
      food processing. Increased intestinal permeability should be largely improved by 
      dietary addition of compounds, such as glutamine or curcumin, which both have the
      mechanistic potential to inhibit the inflammation and oxidative stress linked to 
      tight junction opening. This brief review aims to increase physician awareness of
      this common, albeit largely unrecognized, pathology, which may be easily
      prevented or improved by means of simple nutritional changes.

TI  - Evaluation of urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate excretion in women at different
      age with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 295-300
AB  - Melatonin (MT) exerts a beneficial action in the treatment of many diseases,
      among them also in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its secretion decreases with
      age, particularly, in the postmenopausal period in women. It has not been
      determined whether these changes can have an impact on the clinical picture of
      IBS. The study aimed at evaluating the urinary excretion of the main MT
      metabolite - 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate (6-HMS) in women at different age with
      IBS. The investigations were carried out in five groups of 30 women each. Group
      Ia (the controls) - premenopausal healthy women (20-39 years), group Ib (the
      controls) - postmenopausal healthy women (46-66 years), group II - women with
      constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C; 19-42 years), group III - women with
      diarrhoea predominant IBS (IBS-D; 20-39 years), group IV - women with IBS-C
      (49-68 years), group V - women with IBS-D (48-69 years). The diagnosis of IBS was
      based on the Rome III Criteria after excluding other diseases. On the day of the 
      study the patients remained on the same liquid diet (Nutridrink - 3x400 ml) and
      1500 ml of still mineral water. 6-HMS concentration in urine was measured by
      ELISA method applying IBL antibodies (RE-54031, Immunological Laboratories). The 
      results showed that 24-hour urinary 6-HMS excretion in the studied premenopausal 
      women were as follows: group Ia - 15.13+/-5.83 microg/24 h, group II -
      28.85+/-12.59 microg/24 h (p<0,01), group III - 26.10+/-11.76 microg/24 h
      (p<0,01) and in the postmenopausal subjects they were: group Ib - 10.66+/-3.23
      microg/24 h, group IV - 13.73+/-5.09 microg/24 h ((p=0,02), group V -
      21.39+/-10.88 microg/24 h (p<0,01). In women with IBS-C the obtained results of
      24-hour 6-HMS urinary excretion were independent on the intensity of clinical
      symptoms. On the other hand, in women with IBS-D, both in the group III and V,
      higher intensity of ailments was accompanied by significantly increased 6-HMS
      urinary excretion. The results of the study allowed drawing the following
      conclusions: (1). 24-hour 6-HMS urinary excretion in women with the
      constipation-predominant (IBS-C) as well as the diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D)
      is higher than in healthy persons both in the premenopausal and postmenopausal
      period. (2). Relatively high 6-HMS urinary excretion in postmenopausal women with
      IBS-D indicates an adaptive increase in MT secretion from EC in the gut.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many of the ideas on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are
      derived from studies conducted in Western societies. Their relevance to Asian
      societies has not been critically examined. Our objectives were to bring to
      attention important data from Asian studies, articulate the experience and views 
      of our Asian experts, and provide a relevant guide on this poorly understood
      condition for doctors and scientists working in Asia. METHODS: A multinational
      group of physicians from Asia with special interest in IBS raised statements on
      IBS pertaining to symptoms, diagnosis, epidemiology, infection, pathophysiology, 
      motility, management, and diet. A modified Delphi approach was employed to
      present and grade the quality of evidence, and determine the level of agreement. 
      RESULTS: We observed that bloating and symptoms associated with meals were
      prominent complaints among our IBS patients. In the majority of our countries, we
      did not observe a female predominance. In some Asian populations, the intestinal 
      transit times in healthy and IBS patients appear to be faster than those reported
      in the West. High consultation rates were observed, particularly in the more
      affluent countries. There was only weak evidence to support the perception that
      psychological distress determines health-care seeking. Dietary factors, in
      particular, chili consumption and the high prevalence of lactose malabsorption,
      were perceived to be aggravating factors, but the evidence was weak. CONCLUSIONS:
      This detailed compilation of studies from different parts of Asia, draws
      attention to Asian patients' experiences of IBS.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the evidences for the usefulness of dietary
      manipulations (including the use of probiotics and prebiotics) in the management 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusion diets do not have a
      role in the management of these patients except in the case of malabsorbed sugars
      (lactose, fructose). However, recent work suggests that excluding these sugars is
      more effective in non-IBS than in IBS patients. Also, the first small open series
      on the use of very low (20 g/day) carbohydrate diet (VLCD) in IBS has been
      published with promising results. However, safety concerns do not allow us to
      recommend them. In the period of review, further evidence has been provided on
      the role of psyllium in IBS. Also, the available evidence on the use of
      probiotics in IBS has been meta-analyzed. SUMMARY: IBS patients should eat a
      balanced diet without restrictions, and (except for malabsorbed sugars) exclusion
      diets are not useful in most of them. The role of VLCD remains to be established.
      The concept that increasing fiber intake is useful for IBS may not be true for
      all patients, and hydrophilic colloids (e.g. psyllium) are preferred. There is
      growing evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS.

      and adolescents.
PG  - 293-304
LID - 10.1586/egh.10.28 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are among the 
      most commonly diagnosed medical problems in pediatrics. Symptom-based Rome III
      criteria for FAP and IBS have been validated and help the clinician in making a
      positive diagnosis. The majority of patients with mild complaints improve with
      reassurance and time. For a distinct subset of patients with more severe and
      disabling illness, finding effective treatment for these disorders remains a
      challenge. Over the years, a wide range of therapies have been proposed and
      studied. The lack of a single, proven intervention highlights the complex
      interplay of biopsychosocial factors probably involved in the development of
      childhood FAP and IBS, and the need for a multidisciplinary, integrated approach.
      This article reviews the current literature on the efficacy of pharmacologic,
      dietary and psychosocial interventions for FAP and IBS in children and
      adolescents.

TI  - [Causes of functional digestive disorders and therapeutic approach in primary
      care medicine].
PG  - 75-9
AB  - UNLABELLED: Functional diseases of digestive tract are an ubiquitary problem of
      diagnosis and treatment for ambulatory care services. Its evolution is chronicle 
      but there are no organic lesions for the beginning. Nevertheless, it impairs
      quality of life and creates many days of incapacity of work. MATERIAL AND METHOD:
      We studied 1118 cases with digestive malfunctions, selected from the patients
      consulted on Ambulatory Care Unit--Internal Medicine, 2007-2008. RESULTS: Basal
      clinical and laboratory explorations classified the type of digestive
      malfunctions according to international criteria. So we found these types of
      anomalies: gastro-oesofagial reflux--788 cases; peptic-like syndrome--752 cases; 
      pyloric functional spasm--385 cases; helicobacter pyloridi positive--632 cases;
      gallblader dysfunction--767 cases; irritable bowel syndrome--872 cases. The
      treatment was applied pursued the pathological status. Most of cases had un
      diagnosticated diseases as peptic ulcer, gastritis, gallbladder diseases.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are that the whole tract has continuity and the site
      of dysfunction is difficult to diagnose from the beginning. Pro-kinetic drugs and
      inhibitory of gastric secretion have very good results. The same time we must
      treat the "background"--extra digestive factors (i.e., Helicobacter pylori
      infection).

TI  - Performance of two commercial ELISAs for detecting IgA anti-human and anti-guinea
      pig tissue transglutaminase antibodies.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sensitivity and specificity of anti-human tissue transglutaminase
      antibodies (anti-htTGA) seem to be superior to those of anti-tissue
      transglutaminase of guinea pig (anti-gptTGA) for screening patients with celiac
      disease (CD), but there are still controversies. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the performance of two INOVA ELISA kits to detect IgA anti-htTGA and
      anti-gptTGA in patients with and without CD. METHODS: The study groups were
      comprised of 49 anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)-positive untreated-CD, and 123
      controls (EMA-negative treated CD, EMA-negative chronic diarrhea, autoimmune
      hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and healthy people). RESULTS: The agreement
      between the two ELISAs was statistically significant in all study groups and
      there was no significant difference between them (92.7% agreement; kappa = 0.70; 
      kappa p = 0.001; McNemar p = 1). All patients with serum reactivity of more than 
      100 units had histologic diagnosis of CD. In seven of 10 patients with treated-CD
      who had control biopsies, villous atrophy was still present in four who tested
      positive by both kits. Two of three celiacs with histologic remission tested
      positive for both anti-tTGA. CONCLUSIONS: the anti-gptTGA and anti-htTGA
      determination were equally efficient in identifying patients with untreated-CD
      with high titers of EMA. Whatever the anti-tTGA ELISA used, the reactivity above 
      100 units was always related to active CD diagnosed by histologic alterations in 
      intestinal biopsies. The anti-tTGA reactivity by both kits was not only similar
      in determining histologic activity in the follow-up of CD after a gluten free
      diet, but also in identifying positive sera from the control groups, regardless
      if CD has been confirmed by duodenal biopsies.

TI  - IBS or intolerance?
PG  - 962-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of specific foods to the genesis of symptoms in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been increasingly recognised in recent years. 
      OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the dietary triggers for IBS and the role of
      diagnostic testing in patients with IBS. DISCUSSION: In addition to the long
      standing implication of lactose in lactase deficient patients, fermentable
      dietary oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, together
      with very low carbohydrate diets, have been increasingly recognised as important 
      in the causation and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding their
      role and utilising the services of a practising dietician have become additional 
      important tools for general practitioners managing this common complaint.

TI  - Covariation of plasma ghrelin and motilin in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1109-12
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.03.021 [doi]
AB  - We have previously shown that ghrelin is mainly localized to the stomach but also
      occurs, together with the prokinetic hormone motilin, in endocrine cells in the
      proximal small intestine. This study explored ghrelin and motilin concentrations 
      in plasma in relation to gastrointestinal motility and whether plasma ghrelin is 
      changed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nine patients with
      severe IBS and 10 healthy subjects underwent stationary antro-duodeni-jejunal
      manometry; blood was sampled during similar motility phases in the two groups.
      The motility phases were monitored and blood samples were collected during
      fasting and after food intake. Plasma was analyzed for two forms of ghrelin
      (octanylated and desoctanylated) as well as for motilin. In IBS patients
      circulating motilin levels covaried with total ghrelin levels (r=0.90; p<0.004), 
      octanylated ghrelin (r=0.77; p<0.02) and desoctanylated ghrelin (r=0.69; p<0.04).
      No such correlations were seen in the control group. Octanylated ghrelin
      comprised 35.3+/-3.9% (mean+/-SEM) of the total circulating ghrelin in the IBS
      patients compared to 40.4+/-4.5% (mean+/-SEM) in the control group (NS). Ghrelin 
      covaried with motilin in plasma in IBS but not in plasma from healthy subjects.
      This suggests the two peptides act together in IBS.

TI  - [Effect of Weichang Anwan on NO and 5-HT in blood serum, SP and MC in colon in
      IBS-D rats].
PG  - 3073-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of Weichang Anwan on the treatment of
      IBS-D in model rats. METHOD: Animal model of compound diarrhea was induced by a
      lactose enriched diet in the Wistar rat, combining with restraint stress. At
      first, the best cycle of taking medicine was tested. In order to decide the best 
      cycle of taking medicine, 24 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal
      control group, model group and 60 mg x kg(1) x d(-1) weichangan group. The rate
      of weight increase, the rate of diarrhea, the incubation period of diarrhea and
      the diarrhea index were observed. And then 45 female Wistar rats randomly divided
      into five groups: normal control group, model group and Weichang Anwan groups of 
      high, medium and low doses( 80, 60, 40 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). The mast cells in
      mucous membrane were observed by light microscope. The level of NO in blood serum
      was checked by the method of nitrate reductase. 5-HT in blood serum was detected 
      by fluorimetry. The level of SP in colon was measured by radioimmunoassay.
      RESULT: After taking Weichang Anwan for 4 days, the rate of weight increase in
      Weichangan group was higher than the model group's. And the rate of diarrhea was 
      lower significantly. So the best cycle of taking medicine was 4 days. The levels 
      of NO and 5-HT in blood serum decreased remarkably in the model group than those 
      of the normal control group. At the same time, the amount of the mast cells and
      the level of SP in colon significantly increased. Compared with the model group, 
      the levels of NO and 5-HT in blood serum increased remarkably in the groups of
      high doses and medium doses. Meanwhile, the amount of the mast cells and the
      level of SP in colon decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Weichang Anwan has the 
      effect of antidiarrhea. It can adjust the levels of NO and 5-HT in blood serum
      and can inhibit the expression of SP in colon which can active the mast cell.
      Weichangan can also decrease the amount of the mast cells directly.

TI  - A candidate probiotic with unfavourable effects in subjects with irritable bowel 
      syndrome: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-10-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some probiotics have shown efficacy for patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum MF1298 was found to have the best in
      vitro probiotic properties of 22 strains of lactobacilli. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the symptomatic effect of L. plantarum MF1298 in subjects with
      IBS. Primary outcome was treatment preference and secondary outcomes were number 
      of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and IBS sum score. METHODS: The
      design was a randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. 16
      subjects with IBS underwent two three-week periods of daily intake of one capsule
      of 10(10) CFU L. plantarum MF 1298 or placebo separated by a four-week washout
      period. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (81%; 95% CI 57% to 93%; P = 0.012)
      preferred placebo to L. plantarum MF1298 treatment. The mean (SD) number of weeks
      with satisfactory relief of symptoms in the periods with L. plantarum MF1298 and 
      placebo were 0.50 (0.89) and 1.44 (1.26), respectively (P = 0.006). IBS sum score
      was 6.44 (1.81) in the period with L. plantarum MF1298 treatment compared with
      5.35 (1.77) in the period with placebo (P = 0.010). With a clinically significant
      difference in the IBS sum score of 2 in disfavour of active treatment, the number
      needed to harm was 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.9. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows for the
      first time an unfavourable effect on symptoms in subjects with IBS after intake
      of a potential probiotic.

PG  - 213-8
LID - 10.1016/j.phrs.2010.01.004 [doi]
AB  - A new era in medical science has dawned with the realization of the critical role
      of the "forgotten organ", the enteric microbiota, in generating a variety of
      functions which sustain health and, when disrupted, lead to disease. Central to
      this beneficial interaction between the microbiota and man is the manner in which
      the bacteria contained within the gut "talk" to the immune system and, in
      particular, the immune system that is so widespread within the gut itself, the
      gut-associated (or mucosa-associated) lymphoid system. Into this landscape come
      two new players: probiotics and prebiotics. While many products have masqueraded 
      as probiotics, only those which truly and reproducibly contain live organisms and
      which have been shown, in high quality human studies, to confer a health benefit 
      can actually claim this title. Several human disease states have benefited from
      the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel
      diseases, certain infectious disorders and, most recently, irritable bowel
      syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria and, while a variety
      of health benefits have been attributed to their use, prebiotics have been
      subjected to few large scale clinical trials.

TI  - A cytologic assay for diagnosis of food hypersensitivity in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 254-60
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2009.11.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A percentage of patients with symptoms of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH) and improve on a
      food-elimination diet. No assays have satisfactory levels of sensitivity for
      identifying patients with FH. We evaluated the efficacy of an in vitro basophil
      activation assay in the diagnosis of FH in IBS-like patients. METHODS: Blood
      samples were collected from 120 consecutive patients diagnosed with IBS according
      to Rome II criteria. We analyzed in vitro activation of basophils by food
      allergens (based on levels of CD63 expression), as well as total and
      food-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels in serum. Effects of elimination diets 
      and double-blind food challenges were used as standards for FH diagnosis.
      RESULTS: Twenty-four of the patients (20%) had FH (cow's milk and/or wheat
      hypersensitivity); their symptom scores improved significantly when they were
      placed on an elimination diet. Patients with FH differed from other IBS patients 
      in that they had a longer duration of clinical history, a history of FH as
      children, and an increased frequency of self-reported FH; they also had
      hypersensitivities to other antigens (eg, egg or soy). The basophil activation
      assay diagnosed FH with 86% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 87% accuracy; this 
      level of sensitivity was significantly higher than that of serum total IgE or
      food-specific IgE assays. CONCLUSIONS: A cytometric assay that quantifies
      basophils after stimulation with food antigens based on cell-surface expression
      of CD63 had high levels of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing
      FH. This assay might be used to diagnose FH in patients with IBS-like symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and could be diet related. We studied
      postprandial changes in distribution of water in the upper gastrointestinal tract
      of healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with IBS-D after contrasting meals.
      METHODS: In study 1, 11 HVs consumed 350-mL test meals with 5% mannitol
      (unabsorbable) or 5% glucose (readily absorbed). In study 2, 17 HVs consumed a
      331-kcal meal, with or without 15 g bran. In study 3, 26 patients with IBS-D
      consumed the study 2 diet with bran meal. All subjects underwent serial magnetic 
      resonance imaging analysis. RESULTS: In study 1, subjects' small bowel water
      content (SBWC) increased after the mannitol but not glucose meals, reaching 381
      mL (interquartile range, 343-491 mL) and 47 mL (18-78 mL), respectively, 40
      minutes after eating (P < .001). In study 2, SBWC initially decreased after both 
      meal types and then increased, plateauing at 180-405 minutes and was greater
      after the bran meal (P = .02). In study 3, fasting and postprandial SBWC was
      lower in IBS-D than in HVs (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively). Patients with
      IBS-D had faster orocecal transit times (135 minutes; 90-180 minutes) compared
      with HVs (225 minutes; 203-293 minutes; P < .0001) and reduced terminal ileum
      diameter (P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial SBWC initially decreases, because 
      of rapid, nutrient-driven fluid absorption, and then increases after a mixed
      liquid/solid meal. Patients with IBS-D have reduced fasting and postprandial SBWC
      with faster transit, possibly indicating increased small intestinal tone.

AB  - Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) commonly report the
      precipitation of symptoms on food ingestion. Though the role of dietary
      constituents in IBS has not been extensively studied, food could contribute to
      symptom onset or even the causation of IBS through a number of mechanisms. First,
      the physiological response of the intestine to food ingestion could precipitate
      symptoms in predisposed individuals; second, there is some evidence that allergy 
      or intolerance to a particular food can produce IBS-like symptoms, third, certain
      foods may alter the composition of the luminal milieu, either directly or
      indirectly through effects on bacterial metabolism, and thus induce symptoms and,
      finally, IBS may develop following exposure to food-borne pathogens.
      Anticipatory, psychological factors generated by previous negative experiences
      with food ingestion or other factors may also contribute though their
      contribution has been scarcely quantified. Not surprisingly, there is
      considerable interest in the potential roles of diet and food supplements in the 
      therapy of IBS; for the most part, the evidence base for such recommendations
      remains slim though certain probiotics show considerable promise.

AB  - Managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is difficult and often a source of
      dissatisfaction for the patient, explaining the increasingly frequent recourse to
      alternative treatments. These highly varied treatments are often associated. They
      can be classed into four categories: reflexology methods, interventions on the
      psyche, biological therapies, and treatments using certain forms of energy.
      Although some studies show interesting results, currently there are not
      sufficient scientific arguments to recommend one or another of these alternative 
      treatments. Multicenter controlled studies are needed to better evaluate the
      strategies that appear to be cost-effective.

PG  - S68-78

AB  - In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief 
      of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents,
      or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of
      dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary
      fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, 
      osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while
      loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of
      stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve
      symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower
      doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for 
      pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance
      to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin,
      metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical
      trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or
      lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic
      approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in 
      combination with pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Frequency of lactose malabsorption among healthy southern and northern Indian
      populations by genetic analysis and lactose hydrogen breath and tolerance tests.
PG  - 140-6
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), the inability to break down lactose into 
      glucose and galactose, is due to a deficiency in the small intestinal lactase
      phlorizin hydrolase enzyme. Ethnic and geographic variations of LM are known.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of LM in healthy
      southern and northern Indian populations. DESIGN: A total of 153 healthy
      volunteers (76 from southern and 77 from northern India) were evaluated for LM by
      using a lactose tolerance test (LTT), a lactose hydrogen breath test (lactose
      HBT), and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism to
      identify the lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism (confirmed by sequencing).
      RESULTS: Volunteers from southern and northern India were comparable in age and
      sex. The LTT result was abnormal in 88.2% of southern Indians and in 66.2% of
      northern Indians (P = 0.001). The lactose HBT result was abnormal in 78.9% of
      southern Indians and in 57.1% of northern Indians (P = 0.003). The CC genotype
      was present in 86.8% and 67.5% (P = 0.002), the CT genotype was present in 13.2% 
      and 26.0% (P = 0.036), and the TT genotype was present in 0% and 6.5% (P = 0.03) 
      of southern and northern Indians, respectively. The frequency of symptoms after
      the lactose load (47.4% compared with 15.6%; P < 0.001) and peak concentrations
      of breath hydrogen (88.5 +/- 71.9 compared with 55.4 +/- 61.9 ppm; P = 0.003),
      both of which might indicate the degree of lactase deficiency, were higher in
      southern than in northern Indians. CONCLUSION: The frequency and degree of LM is 
      higher in southern than in northern Indian healthy populations because of genetic
      differences in these populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of probiotic bacteria in IBS remain controversial. AIM:
      To study the effects of a probiotic product on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We
      randomized 74 IBS patients to receive 8 weeks of daily treatment with 400 mL milk
      fermented with the yoghurt bacteria and containing Lactobacillus paracasei, ssp. 
      paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12
      (Cultura; active) or acidified milk without these bacteria (control). The primary
      endpoint was the proportion of subjects reporting adequate relief of their IBS
      symptoms at least 50% of the weeks. IBS symptom severity, psychological symptoms 
      and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was 38% 
      (14/37 patients) in the active group and 27% (10/37 patients) in the control
      group (P = 0.3). IBS symptom severity improved significantly in both groups
      during the treatment period. This change was greater in the active group during
      the first 2 weeks, but thereafter, no significant group differences were seen.
      CONCLUSIONS: We could not detect a clearly positive effect of fermented milk
      containing three probiotic bacteria on GI symptoms in IBS patients compared with 
      the control treatment. However, a trend towards a more favourable effect during
      the first weeks was seen in the active group.

TI  - Assessment of dietary intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 185-9
AB  - The dietary intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome was assessed using
      24-h dietary recall. The energy value and nutrient contents in the daily food
      rations were calculated by Nutritionist IV computer program with the Polish
      database. Differentiations in the Polish RDA coverage for energy and nutrients
      were observed in the studied group. Fat, saturated fatty acid, phosphorus and
      also vitamin A, E and C contents were above the RDA in the patients' daily food
      ration. The majority of IBS individuals did not meet recommendations for
      carbohydrate intake. Calcium and cooper intake was below the Polish RDA. The
      insufficient vitamin B2 intake and excessive Fe supply have been shown in the
      male patients.

TI  - A Brazilian experience of the self transglutaminase-based test for celiac disease
      case finding and diet monitoring.
PG  - 4423-8
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a rapid and easy fingertip whole blood
      point-of-care test for celiac disease (CD) case finding and diet monitoring.
      METHODS: Three hundred individuals, 206 females (68.7%) and 94 males (31.3%),
      were submitted to a rapid and easy immunoglobulin-A-class fingertip whole blood
      point-of-care test in the doctor's office in order to make immediate clinical
      decisions: 13 healthy controls, 6 with CD suspicion, 46 treated celiacs, 84
      relatives of the celiac patients, 69 patients with dyspepsia, 64 with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), 8 with Crohn's disease and 9 with other causes of diarrhea.
      RESULTS: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies was performed in
      patients with CD suspicion and in individuals with positive test outcome: in
      83.3% (5/6) of the patients with CD suspicion, in 100% of the patients that
      admitted gluten-free diet transgressions (6/6), in 3.8% of first-degree relatives
      (3/79) and in 2.9% of patients with dyspepsia (2/69). In all these individuals
      duodenal biopsies confirmed CD (Marsh's histological classification). The studied
      test showed good correlation with serologic antibodies, endoscopic and
      histological findings. CONCLUSION: The point-of-care test was as reliable as
      conventional serological tests in detecting CD cases and in CD diet monitoring.

TI  - Clinical impact of identifying lactose maldigestion or fructose malabsorption in 
      irritable bowel syndrome or other conditions.
PG  - 1010-2
LID - 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181b64c7f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of carbohydrate maldigestion or malabsorption remains
      unclear in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this
      study was to examine the impact of identifying lactose maldigestion (LM) and
      fructose malabsorption (FM) on patients with and without IBS. METHODS: Patients
      who received lactose and fructose challenge testing formed the study group.
      Carbohydrate challenge testing was performed with 50 g lactose and 25 g fructose.
      Breath samples were collected and analyzed for hydrogen, methane, and CO2 (for
      correction) using a MicroLyzer Model SC (QuinTron Instrument Company, Milwaukee, 
      WI). Questionnaires were used to assess Rome III IBS criteria, compliance with
      carbohydrate dietary modifications, and changes in symptoms. RESULTS: One hundred
      and twenty-one of the 181 (67%) study subjects were able to be contacted 8 months
      to 4 years after carbohydrate testing. LM (21) and FM (2) were seen in 33% of the
      66 IBS subjects. LM (12) and FM (9) were seen in 33% of the 55 subjects without
      IBS. Seventy-seven percent of IBS and 72% of those without IBS reported
      compliance with dietary advice. Of the subjects who reported compliance, 47% of
      IBS and 77% of those without IBS reported that, after identifying LM or FM, their
      symptoms resolved or improved. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate maldigestion has a
      similar incidence in patients with and without IBS and both populations have
      similar compliance with therapeutic diets. However, patients without IBS are more
      likely to have improvement in symptoms when dietary changes are instituted when
      compared to IBS patients.

PG  - 103-12

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is a common complaint in childhood and
      adolescence. Despite decades of clinical observations and research, it still
      poses a challenge to pediatric health care professionals. The aim of this review 
      is to highlight the epidemiology of pediatric chronic abdominal pain and to
      describe the pathogenesis of this disorder, its clinical manifestations,
      evaluation and therapeutic options. DATA SOURCES: Articles on chronic abdominal
      pain in the recent years from PubMed, MEDLINE, and reference textbooks were
      reviewed. RESULTS: Chronic abdominal pain, a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      (FGID), is a multifactorial condition that results from a complex interaction
      between psychosocial and physiologic factors via the brain-gut axis. A thorough
      history coupled with a complete physical examination and normal screening studies
      rule out an organic cause in 95% of the cases. It is highly important for the
      physician to establish a trusting relationship with the child and parents because
      successful treatment including modification of physical and psychological stress 
      factors, dietary changes, and drug therapy depends greatly on education,
      reassurance and active psychological support. CONCLUSIONS: FGIDs are a cause of
      great anxiety, distress and morbidity in children as well as adults. As our
      understanding of these conditions improves, our therapeutic interventions will
      progress not only to overcome them but also to intervene early in the disease
      course so as to limit long-term impact.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of increasing the dietary content of
      soluble fibre (psyllium) or insoluble fibre (bran) in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practice.
      PARTICIPANTS: 275 patients aged 18-65 years with irritable bowel syndrome.
      INTERVENTIONS: 12 weeks of treatment with 10 g psyllium (n=85), 10 g bran (n=97),
      or 10 g placebo (rice flour) (n=93). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point
      was adequate symptom relief during at least two weeks in the previous month,
      analysed after one, two, and three months of treatment to assess both short term 
      and sustained effectiveness. Secondary end points included irritable bowel
      syndrome symptom severity score, severity of abdominal pain, and irritable bowel 
      syndrome quality of life scale. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was
      significantly greater in the psyllium group than in the placebo group during the 
      first month (57% v 35%; relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.26)
      and the second month of treatment (59% v 41%; 1.44, 1.02 to 2.06). Bran was more 
      effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% v 32%; 1.70,
      1.12 to 2.57), but this was not statistically significant in the worst case
      analysis (1.45, 0.97 to 2.16). After three months of treatment, symptom severity 
      in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points, compared with 49 points in the
      placebo group (P=0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P=0.61 versus placebo).
      No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Fifty four (64%) of
      the patients allocated to psyllium, 54 (56%) in the bran group, and 56 (60%) in
      the placebo group completed the three month treatment period. Early dropout was
      most common in the bran group; the main reason was that the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium offers benefits in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials

      effects of gender and menstrual status.
PG  - 919-29
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04121.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatology and physiology differ between men and women and across
      the menstrual cycle in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Ovarian hormones influence
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), an amine known to play a role in gut motor-sensory
      function. AIM: To assess the effects of gender and menstrual status on
      platelet-depleted plasma (PDP) 5-HT concentration in IBS patients with diarrhoea 
      (IBS-D) patients compared with healthy volunteers (HV). METHODS:
      Platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT concentrations were assessed under fasting and fed 
      conditions in 73 IBS-D patients (aged 18-58 years; 18 men) and 64 HV (aged 18-50 
      years; 24 men). Women were divided into those with low or high
      progesterone/oestrogen (P/O) levels. RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients
      with diarrhoea had higher PDP 5-HT concentrations than HV under fasting (P =
      0.002) and fed (P = 0.049) conditions. This was particularly related to IBS-D men
      having higher PDP 5-HT concentrations than healthy controls (P = 0.002).
      Moreover, PDP 5-HT concentrations in IBS-D women with low P/O levels were similar
      to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to IBS-D women with high P/O levels,
      IBS-D men also have raised PDP 5-HT concentrations. 5-HT concentration normalizes
      at menses in IBS-D women, suggesting a shift in the mechanisms responsible for
      abnormal 5-HT signalling in these patients.

TI  - [Frequency of celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome coexistance and its
      influence on the disease course].
PG  - 126-9
AB  - Celiac disease is increasingly recognized autoimmune enteropathy caused by a
      permanent gluten intolerance. Gluten is the main storage protein of wheat, in
      genetically predisposed individuals. Celiac disease risk in first degree
      relatives is about 10%. Diarrhea and changes of bowel movement, observed as well 
      in celiac disease as in IBS, may lead to misdiagnosis of IBS basing on the Rome
      criteria or may be associated with coexistence of both diseases. The aim of the
      study was to assess the celiac disease prevalence in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome. The study group comprised 200 patients (120 women and 80 men)
      aged 18-78 years (mean: 46.7 years) with diarrhoeal form of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), according to the Rome criteria II. At the beginning and after a
      three month period anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA tTG) were
      estimated. Gastroscopy with biopsy where performed in those with IgA tTG titre
      above 1/200. 40 patients were immunologically positive and 14 of them have
      histopathologically proven celiac disease. In the group of patients with detected
      celiac disease, gluten free diet was applied besides the treatment with
      trimebutin or mebewerin, recommended for IBS. After 6 months the decrease of IgA 
      tTG titre in the serum was observed. In 5 of these patients IgA tTG level was
      negative. It was associated with the significant decrease of clinical symptoms,
      such as diarrhea and flatulence. The remaining symptoms, such as abdominal pain, 
      feeling of incomplete defecation demanded continuation of IBS treatment. With
      regard to often atypical celiac disease symptoms--adult active searching should
      be performed to differentiate from irritable bowel syndrome.

      factors.
PG  - 772-80
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2009.07.005 [doi]
AB  - Symptoms consistent with the irritable bowel syndrome are remarkably frequent
      around the world. Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence ranges from 2.1% to 22%,
      depending on criteria used. Women are more frequently affected than men, but the 
      reasons remain obscure; irritable bowel syndrome occurs in all age groups but
      there appears to be a modest decline in prevalence with advancing age again for
      unknown reasons. The incidence of irritable bowel syndrome per year has been
      estimated at approximately 1.5% in community subjects; annually only 0.2% of
      population will be diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. The natural history
      of irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by symptomatic flare ups and by a
      high rate of transition to other functional gastrointestinal diseases over the
      long term. Well recognized risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome include
      psychological distress and gastroenteritis. However, the association of
      psychological distress in some cases may reflect confounding factors and might be
      explained at least in part by cytokine production. Familial aggregation of
      irritable bowel syndrome occurs, and while the environment is key, twin studies
      generally support a genetic component in irritable bowel syndrome explaining up
      to 20% of the variability. Prior surgery may increase risk of irritable bowel
      syndrome. Early childhood trauma may be important; a low birth weight,
      nasogastric suction at birth, childhood abuse, and low socioeconomic status may
      carry an increased risk of suffering with irritable bowel syndrome as an adult.
      The role of diet remains uncertain but under-studied.

      clinical trial.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-9-24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional bowel disorder with
      symptoms of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation experienced by 10% of U.S.
      adults, results in significant disability, impaired quality of life, and
      health-care burden. Conventional medical care focusing on pharmacological
      approaches, diet, and lifestyle management has been partially effective in
      controlling symptoms. Behavioral treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy
      and hypnosis, are promising. This paper describes an on-going feasibility study
      to assess the efficacy of mindfulness training, a behavioral treatment involving 
      directing and sustaining attention to present-moment experience, for the
      treatment of IBS. METHODS/DESIGN: The study design involves randomization of
      adult women with IBS according to Rome II criteria, to either an eight-week
      mindfulness training group (based on a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction [MBSR] 
      format) or a previously validated IBS social-support group as an
      attention-control condition. The primary hypothesis is that, compared to Support 
      Group participants, those in the Mindfulness Program will demonstrate significant
      improvement in IBS symptoms as measured by the IBS Symptom Severity Scale [1].
      DISCUSSION: 214 individuals have been screened for eligibility, of whom 148 were 
      eligible for the study. Of those, 87 were enrolled, with 21 withdrawing after
      having given consent. 66 have completed or are in the process of completing the
      interventions. It is feasible to undertake a rigorous randomized clinical trial
      of mindfulness training for people with IBS, using a standardized MBSR protocol
      adapted for those experiencing IBS, compared to a control social-support group
      previously utilized in IBS studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a mild disorder; purely symptomatic treatment.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - (1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders,
      associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an
      underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious
      disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, 
      unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also
      present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course 
      of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on
      abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials.
      Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and
      only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do
      not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to 
      have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse
      effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor
      has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
      (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of
      potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative
      risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well
      as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic 
      laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation 
      can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly
      assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It
      modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; 
      (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients
      are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel
      syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9)
      Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances
      have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and
      psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral
      products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of
      intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with
      inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six
      available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a
      placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel
      syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment
      should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful
      physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available 
      treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best 
      to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry
      a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.

      effects on fasting and postprandial rectal sensitivity and symptoms in

PG  - 1131-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2009.01990.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) on fasting and
      postprandial (PP) perception of rectal distension and symptoms in hypersensitive 
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). METHODS: Forty-two
      patients meeting Rome II criteria for IBS-C and with a pain threshold of < 32
      mmHg were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
      Patients received either oral PEG, 3.45 g t.i.d. orally for 30 days or placebo.
      Rectal sensitivity was assessed before and after treatment with a barostat using 
      the ascending method of limits, during basal and PP periods. RESULTS: No changes 
      in fasting and PP rectal tone and thresholds for first sensation, gas sensation, 
      urge to defecate, and pain was observed with PEG in relation to placebo. In both 
      groups, pressure at which patients crossed the thresholds for noxious (PEG: from 
      28 +/- 8.8 to 22 +/- 6.9 mmHg) and non noxious (PEG: from 16 +/- 4.9 to 12 +/-
      3.6 mmHg) stimuli decreased compared with pretreatment values. PEG improved
      consistency of faeces and showed a trend to diminish blood in faeces. PEG and
      placebo increased bowel movements per week (P < 0.001), and relieved symptoms
      without significant side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Both PEG 3350 and placebo were
      clinically useful in patients with IBS-C, an effect that cannot be explained by
      changes in rectal tone and sensation. The results support the concept that
      visceral sensitivity is not stable and has a heterogeneous response to drugs, and
      suggest the existence of a post healing hypersensitivity state.

TI  - The role of diet in symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in adults: a narrative
      review.
PG  - 1204-14
LID - 10.1016/j.jada.2009.04.012 [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes what is known about the effect of diet on irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms emphasizing data from randomized, controlled clinical
      trials. Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be
      caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate 
      that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including
      fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar
      alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long
      history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may 
      worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will
      improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been
      adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS
      symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture 
      yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, 
      it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an
      adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the
      most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified
      exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating
      classes of food may be useful.

TI  - Sex differences in dietary coping with gastrointestinal symptoms.
PG  - 327-33
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e32832b9c53 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Nutritional changes are often considered first-line treatment in public
      health diseases that apply to many gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, as different 
      food and beverages may modulate GI motor and sensory functions, and may provoke
      GI symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine dietary coping and possible
      changes in food and beverage intake in relation to GI symptoms reported by
      identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients compared with healthy
      controls, and whether any sex differences were observed in these respects.
      METHODS: A population-based case-control design was used. Three primary
      healthcare centres were selected in the city of Linkoping in Sweden. The IBS
      patients were recruited from the studied primary healthcare centers on the basis 
      of diagnoses from computerized medical records. The controls were randomly
      selected from the general population in the same region. A questionnaire was used
      with specific questions about self-reported food and beverage increase or
      decrease of GI symptoms and self-reported changes in dietary habits. RESULTS:
      Female IBS patients seem to be more willing to change dietary habits because of
      their GI problems than men. Effects of these nutritional behaviour changes were
      reported for almost all participants that had made dietary adjustments. Fatty
      food, certain vegetables, dairy products and eggs were significantly more
      reported to cause GI complaints among IBS patients compared with their controls. 
      CONCLUSION: Female IBS patients reported more changes in their dietary habits
      because of GI problems than men with the disease. The majority of both women and 
      men who changed their dietary habits because of GI problems experienced
      improvement in their symptoms.

TI  - Between celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome: the "no man's land" of
      gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 1587-94
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.188 [doi]
AB  - The repertoire of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is finite; however, the
      etiologies and mechanisms underlying symptom generation and perception are
      diverse and, in many cases, unknown. This review examines the clinical and
      experimental evidence exploring the putative relationship between gluten
      sensitivity (GS) and the generation of GI symptoms. It explores the hypothesis
      that, in a proportion of patients, GS causes functional bowel disorder (FBD)-like
      symptoms. We propose a model for investigating and understanding the induction of
      GI symptoms and dysfunction by gluten in FBD and organic disease. We hypothesize 
      that, even in the absence of fully developed celiac disease, gluten can induce
      symptoms similar to FBD. We discuss the hypothesis that GS and post-infectious
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) provide two triggers that can explain at least
      part of the spectrum that constitutes IBS, further advancing an understanding of 
      the role of mucosal responses to luminal factors in FBDs. We propose that the
      animal model of GS in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- DQ8 mice allows
      investigation of mucosal pathophysiological changes that occur before the onset
      of full-blown inflammation in a GS host. A better understanding of how gluten can
      cause symptoms in sensitive individuals will illuminate the interaction between
      host genotype, diet, and intestinal microbiota in generating one of the most
      common GI conditions.

TI  - [Determination of milk and diary products consumption and their connection with
      lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in selected disorders of the
      alimentary tract in children].
PG  - 110-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: Lactose stimulates proliferation and colonization of acidophilic
      bacteria, which due to fermentation processes lower colonic pH and simplified
      absorption of some microelements from the intestine. However, the common problem 
      in children is intolerance of this carbohydrate. Treatment, quite simple, is
      based on partial or total elimination of lactose from diet. Some substitutional
      products with equivalent nutritional value should be introduced to prevent
      deficiencies symptoms during lactose-free diet. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY:
      Determination of milk and dairy products consumption and their connection with
      lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in children above 5 years of age in 
      selected disorders of the alimentary tract: food allergy, celiac disease,
      secondary enteropathy, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and
      deficiency of body weight and height. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of 301
      patients above 5 years of age (135 boys and 166 girls; mean age 11.5 years) were 
      included into the study. Milk and dairy products consumption habits, lactose
      intolerance symptoms, hydrogen breath test, activity of lactase and villous
      atrophy were investigated. RESULTS: Decreased sweet milk consumption from, 33.33%
      in children with food allergy to 55.38% in children with functional indigestion
      was observed, in spite of gastrointestinal complaints after ingestion of milk.
      The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance frequency was observed 
      in children with decreased sweet milk consumption due to complaints after
      ingestion of milk and in children who didn't drink milk. There were no
      statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption
      and lactose intolerance symptoms in children with different dairy products
      consumption habits. There were no statistically significant difference between
      frequency of hypolactasia in children with different sweet milk or dairy products
      consumption habits. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent (33-55%) decreased sweet milk
      consumption in children in spite of clinical symptoms after ingestion of milk was
      observed. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms
      frequency was observed in children who didn't drink milk and in children with
      decreased consumption of sweet milk due to complaints after ingestion of milk.
      There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose
      malabsorption and lactose intolerance in children with different dairy products
      consumption habits.

AB  - The term "food allergy" is widely misused for all sorts of symptoms and diseases 
      caused by food. Food allergy (FA) is an adverse reaction to food (food
      hypersensitivity) occurring in susceptible individuals, which is mediated by a
      classical immune mechanism specific for the food itself. The best established
      mechanism in FA is due to the presence of IgE antibodies against the offending
      food. Food intolerance (FI) are all non-immune-mediated adverse reactions to
      food. The subgroups of FI are enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase 
      deficiency), pharmacological (reactions against biogenic amines, histamine
      intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives). 
      The diagnosis of an IgE-mediated FA is made by a carefully taken case history,
      supported by the demonstration of an IgE sensitization either by skin prick tests
      or by in vitro tests, and confirmed by positive oral provocation. For scientific 
      purposes the only accepted test for the confirmation of FA/FI is a properly
      performed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). A panel of
      recombinant allergens, produced as single allergenic molecules, may in future
      improve the diagnosis of IgE-mediated FA. Due to a lack of causal treatment
      possibilities, the elimination of the culprit "food allergen" from the diet is
      the only therapeutic option for patients with real food allergy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS-D) anecdotally report symptom improvement after initiating a very
      low-carbohydrate diet (VLCD). This study prospectively evaluated a VLCD in IBS-D.
      METHODS: Participants with moderate to severe IBS-D were provided a 2-week
      standard diet, then 4 weeks of a VLCD (20 g carbohydrates/d). A responder was
      defined as having adequate relief of gastrointestinal symptoms for 2 or more
      weeks during the VLCD. Changes in abdominal pain, stool habits, and quality of
      life also were measured. RESULTS: Of the 17 participants enrolled, 13 completed
      the study and all met the responder definition, with 10 (77%) reporting adequate 
      relief for all 4 VLCD weeks. Stool frequency decreased (2.6 +/- 0.8/d to 1.4 +/- 
      0.6/d; P < .001). Stool consistency improved from diarrheal to normal form
      (Bristol Stool Score, 5.3 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 1.2; P < .001). Pain scores and
      quality-of-life measures significantly improved. Outcomes were independent of
      weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: A VLCD provides adequate relief, and improves abdominal
      pain, stool habits, and quality of life in IBS-D.

TI  - Fermented milk containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 improved
      self-reported digestive comfort amongst a general population of adults. A
      randomized, open-label, controlled, pilot study.

AB  - AIM: Some probiotics improve digestive comfort of people with Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome, but this needs confirmation in a healthy population. The objective of
      this pilot study was to investigate the effect of consuming fermented milk
      containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 and yoghourt strains
      (test product) on digestive comfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed
      gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: The study was designed to approximate a
      real-life situation, by using a branded product in the intervention groups. In an
      open-label, randomized, controlled trial, 371 adults reporting digestive
      discomfort were randomized into three groups who had a daily consumption of
      either one or two pots of test product over 2 weeks, or to follow their usual
      diet. Digestive comfort and bother from digestive symptoms were assessed by
      questionnaire at baseline and follow-up (per protocol population n = 360).
      Self-reported change in digestive comfort and computed change between baseline
      and follow-up for each of 20 items were compared between groups
      (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). RESULTS: A higher percentage of participants
      consuming the test product reported improved digestive comfort (1-pot group
      82.5%; 2-pot group 84.3%), than controls (2.9%). Their self-reported change
      scores differed significantly (P < 0.001). For both test product groups, almost
      all symptom scores improved significantly more than controls (P < 0.001). There
      were no significant differences between 1-pot and 2-pot groups. CONCLUSIONS: This
      pilot study shows that daily consumption of a probiotic food in real-life
      conditions may be useful in improving digestive comfort and symptom experience of
      adults from general population. Further double-blind randomized controlled
      studies are required to confirm these health benefits.

TI  - Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) in childhood.
PG  - CD003019
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003019.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies 
      for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on 
      physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed 
      by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions 
      for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE
      (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO 
      (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and
      JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were
      employed. Researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant
      studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any
      dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a
      diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II
      criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials
      for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies
      were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were
      included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre
      supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one
      study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled
      odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.26 (0.25,
      6.29). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983)
      compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a
      form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to 
      follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three
      trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation
      with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two
      (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided
      analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% 
      CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on
      the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that
      fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are
      effective in the management of children with RAP.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a trans-galactooligosaccharide prebiotic on faecal
      microbiota and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 508-18

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy 
      of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic
      microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44
      patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel
      crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either
      3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored 
      weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal
      microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global
      assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
      RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 
      0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters
      monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency
      (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score
      of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly
      improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut
      bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These
      findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.

TI  - Effect of a chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, on colonic sensory and
      motor functions in healthy subjects.
PG  - G295-301
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.90558.2008 [doi]
AB  - Lubiprostone, a bicyclic fatty acid chloride channel activator, is efficacious in
      treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. The study aim was to compare effects of lubiprostone and placebo on
      colonic sensory and motor functions in humans. In double-blind, randomized
      fashion, 60 healthy adults received three oral doses of placebo or 24 microg
      lubiprostone per day in a parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. A
      barostat-manometry tube was placed in the left colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy
      and fluoroscopy. We measured treatment effects on colonic sensation and motility 
      with validated methods, with the following end points: colonic compliance,
      fasting and postprandial tone and motility indexes, pain thresholds, and sensory 
      ratings to distensions. Among participants receiving lubiprostone or placebo, 26 
      of 30 and 28 of 30, respectively, completed the study. There were no overall
      effects of lubiprostone on compliance, fasting tone, motility indexes, or
      sensation. However, there was a treatment-by-sex interaction effect for
      compliance (P = 0.02), with lubiprostone inducing decreased fasting compliance in
      women (P = 0.06) and an overall decreased colonic tone contraction after a
      standard meal relative to fasting tone (P = 0.014), with greater effect in women 
      (P < 0.01). Numerical differences of first sensation and pain thresholds (P =
      0.11 in women) in the two groups were not significant. We concluded that oral
      lubiprostone 24 microg does not increase colonic motor function. The findings of 
      decreased colonic compliance and decreased postprandial colonic tone in women
      suggest that motor effects are unlikely to cause accelerated colonic transit with
      lubiprostone, although they may facilitate laxation. Effects of lubiprostone on
      sensitivity deserve further study.

TI  - Patients' explanatory models for irritable bowel syndrome: symptoms and treatment
      more important than explaining aetiology.
PG  - 40-7
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmn087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition associated with 
      no certain organic cause, though diet and stress are widely implicated. The
      condition is frustrating for both sufferers and doctors, and there are problems
      in diagnosing and treating the condition. Eliciting explanatory models (EMs) is a
      useful tool for understanding how individuals relate to their illnesses and their
      expectations for treatment, particularly for illnesses with uncertain aetiology
      like IBS. OBJECTIVES: To understand the EMs, experiences and expectations for
      management of patients with IBS. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews
      were conducted with 51 primary care patients (31 in the UK, 20 in The
      Netherlands) meeting the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS. RESULTS: Although
      IBS often had a significant dampening effect on daily life, IBS patients made
      great efforts not to allow the condition to take over their lives. Triggers of
      symptoms were more important to patients than understanding the underlying
      aetiology of IBS. Diet and stress were both recognized as important triggers, but
      views about which foods were problematic and the extent to which stress was
      modifiable were inconsistent. Diagnosis and treatment were often a confusing and 
      frustrating process, and patients often expected more diagnostic tests than they 
      were offered before receiving a diagnosis of IBS. However, the often poor outcome
      of medical interventions does not, in general, appear to have a negative impact
      on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of
      the extensive impact of IBS on sufferers' daily life and the frustration that
      results from repeatedly trying treatments with little effect. Clearly explaining 
      the guidelines for diagnosing IBS and the range of treatment options may help
      patients to make sense of the diagnostic and treatment processes. The personal EM
      should be addressed during the consultation with the IBS patient, ensuring that
      any successive medical interventions match with the patients' disease perception.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on abdominal distension and gastrointestinal
      transit in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03853.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in
      girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed
      transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with
      acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with 
      constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control
      product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms
      were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS:
      Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant
      reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference -
      39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension
      during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal 
      [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P =
      0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P =
      0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in
      objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as
      reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit 
      is a useful strategy for treating distension.
