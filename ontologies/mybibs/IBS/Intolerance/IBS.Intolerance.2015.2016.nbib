AB  - AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) in adult
      patients undergoing colonoscopy and its association with known diseases. METHODS:
      We selected all cases showing NLH at colonoscopy in a three-year timeframe, and
      stratified them into symptomatic patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-type symptoms or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and
      asymptomatic individuals undergoing endoscopy for colorectal cancer screening.
      Data collection included medical history and final diagnosis. As controls, we
      considered all colonoscopies performed for the aforementioned indications during 
      the same period. RESULTS: One thousand and one hundred fifty colonoscopies were
      selected. NLH was rare in asymptomatic individuals (only 3%), while it was
      significantly more prevalent in symptomatic cases (32%). Among organic conditions
      associated with NLH, the most frequent was IBD, followed by infections and
      diverticular disease. Interestingly, 31% of IBS patients presented diffuse
      colonic NLH. NLH cases shared some distinctive clinical features among IBS
      patients: they were younger, more often female, and had a higher frequency of
      abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea, unspecific inflammation, self-reported
      lactose intolerance and metal contact dermatitis. CONCLUSION: About 1/3 of
      patients with IBS-type symptoms or suspected IBD presented diffuse colonic NLH,
      which could be a marker of low-grade inflammation in a conspicuous subset of IBS 
      patients.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

TI  - [Fructose and fructose intolerance].
PG  - 1708-1716
AB  - Although fructose was discovered in 1794, it was realised in recent decades only 
      that its malabsorption can lead to intestinal symptoms while its excessive
      consumption induces metabolic disturbances. Fructose is a monosaccharide found
      naturally in most fruits and vegetables. Dietary intake of fructose has gradually
      increased in the past decades, especially because of the consumption of high
      fructose corn syrup. With its 16.4 kg/year consumption, Hungary ranks secondly
      after the United States. Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine by
      facilitated transport mediated by glucose transporter proteins-2 and -5, and
      arrives in the liver cells. Here it is transformed enzymatically into
      fructose-1-phosphate and then, fructose-1,5-diphosphate, which splits further
      into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, entering the process of
      glycolysis, triglyceride and uric acid production. The prevalence of fructose
      intolerance varies strongly, depending on the method used. The leading symptoms
      of fructose intolerance are similar, but less severe than those of lactose
      intolerance. Multiple secondary symptoms can also occur. A symptom-based
      diagnosis of fructose intolerance is possible, but the gold standard is the H2
      breath test, though this is less accurate than in lactose testing. Measuring
      fructosaemia is costly, cumbersome and not widely used. Fructose intolerance
      increases intestinal motility and sensitivity, promotes biofilm formation and
      contributes to the development of gastrooesophageal reflux. Long-term use of
      fructose fosters the development of dental caries and non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis. Its role in carcinogenesis is presently investigated. The
      cornerstone of dietary management for fructose intolerance is the individual
      reduction of fructose intake and the FODMAP diet, led by a trained dietetician.
      The newly introduced xylose-isomerase is efficient in reducing the symptoms of
      fructose intolerance. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(43), 1708-1716.

PG  - 74-83
AB  - Diet is considered an important triggering factor for gastrointestinal symptoms
      whose physiopathology includes not only measurable, inflammatory reactions, but
      also functional disorders, where no organic effects may be measured or
      demonstrated. Moreover, the prevalence of the perceived intolerance to certain
      foods ranges from 20-25% (within the general population) to 50-70% in diseases
      like irritable bowel syndrome. This intolerance has been observed particularly
      after the consumption of milk and dairy products, which are frequently considered
      as causative of gastrointestinal symptoms, thus limiting their ingestion.
      However, this behavior reduces the dietary sources of calcium and consequently
      may lead to malnutrition and bone decalcification, amongst other complications.
      The true dairy intolerance (intestinal lactase deficiency) explains most of the
      symptoms ensuing their consumption, but the frequency of such alteration on the
      different gastrointestinal diseases has not been determined. This review focuses 
      on the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases and the existing evidence
      regarding the alterations and symptoms related to the consumption of milk or
      dairy products.

TI  - Adding glucose to food and solutions to enhance fructose absorption is not
      effective in preventing fructose-induced functional gastrointestinal symptoms:
      randomised controlled trials in patients with fructose malabsorption.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, the absorption of fructose in excess of
      glucose in solution is enhanced by the addition of glucose. The present study
      aimed to assess the effects of glucose addition to fructose or fructans on
      absorption patterns and genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with
      functional bowel disorders. METHODS: Randomised, blinded, cross-over studies were
      performed in healthy subjects and functional bowel disorder patients with
      fructose malabsorption. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) was determined for breath 
      hydrogen and symptom responses to: (i) six sugar solutions (fructose in solution)
      (glucose; sucrose; fructose; fructose + glucose; fructan; fructan + glucose) and 
      (ii) whole foods (fructose in foods) containing fructose in excess of glucose
      given with and without additional glucose. Intake of fermentable short chain
      carbohydrates (FODMAPs; fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols)
      was controlled. RESULTS: For the fructose in solution study, in 26 patients with 
      functional bowel disorders, breath hydrogen was reduced after glucose was added
      to fructose compared to fructose alone [mean (SD) AUC 92 (107) versus 859 (980)
      ppm 4 h(-1) , respectively; P = 0.034). Glucose had no effect on breath hydrogen 
      response to fructans (P = 1.000). The six healthy controls showed breath hydrogen
      patterns similar to those with functional bowel disorders. No differences in
      symptoms were experienced with the addition of glucose, except more nausea when
      glucose was added to fructose (P = 0.049). In the fructose in foods study,
      glucose addition to whole foods containing fructose in excess of glucose in nine 
      patients with functional bowel disorders and nine healthy controls had no
      significant effect on breath hydrogen production or symptom response.
      CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a favourable response on symptoms does not support
      the concomitant intake of glucose with foods high in either fructose or fructans 
      in patients with functional bowel disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if children with benign joint hypermobility (BJH)
      syndrome and chronic functional pain disorders have more autonomic dysfunction.
      STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review study of pediatric patients seen in the 
      pediatric neurogastroenterology and autonomic clinic who underwent autonomic
      testing and had either a Beighton score of >/=6 and met Brighton criteria for BJH
      (with BJH) or a score of </=2 (no BJH). RESULTS: Twenty-one female subjects (10
      without BJH) met inclusion criteria; 64% of BJH had diagnosis confirmed by
      genetics consultation. We evaluated for postural tachycardia syndrome, syncope,
      orthostatic intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension. None of these diagnoses, as
      well as baseline heart rate, peak heart rate in first 10 minutes of head up tilt 
      (P = .35 and P = .61, respectively), and sudomotor index (suggestive of autonomic
      neuropathy) (P = .58), showed differences between the groups. Age of onset of
      symptoms was also similar (P = .61) (BJH vs without BJH: median [range]:15.6
      years [12.9-17.5] vs 15.4 years [11.1-18.2]). There was no difference between
      groups in complaints of migraine, chronic nausea, chronic fatigue,
      lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting >3 times/lifetime, delayed onset of sleep,
      irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, functional abdominal
      pain, constipation, or fibromyalgia. CONCLUSIONS: Children with chronic
      functional pain disorders and BJH have autonomic testing findings and comorbid
      features compared with a similar cohort of subjects without BJH, suggesting that 
      BJH is not the driver of the autonomic and comorbid disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently identify foods 
      as exacerbating their gastrointestinal symptoms. In children with IBS, the
      prevalence of perceived food intolerances and their impact are unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of self-perceived food
      intolerances and the relationship of these intolerances to abdominal pain,
      psychosocial distress, and quality of life in children with IBS. DESIGN: We
      conducted a cross-sectional study. Questionnaire and prospective diary data were 
      collected from 2008 to 2014 by trained research coordinators.
      PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were children 7 to 18 years old (pediatric
      Rome III IBS, n=154; age-sex matched healthy children, n=32) in Houston, TX.
      MEASURES: Perceived food intolerances and avoided foods were captured using the
      Childhood Food and Symptom Association Questionnaire. IBS severity was assessed
      by a >/=7-day pain diary and validated psychosocial questionnaires assessing
      quality of life, somatization, functional disability, depression, and anxiety.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: We used descriptive Spearman bivariate
      correlation, chi(2), and Poisson log-linear generalized model with Wald chi(2)
      statistics. RESULTS: A greater proportion of children with IBS (143 of 154
      [92.9%]) vs healthy children (20 of 32 [62.5%]) identified at least one
      self-perceived food intolerance (chi(2)=22.5; P<0.001). Children with IBS
      identified a greater number (median=4 [25% to 75% quartile=2 to 6]) of perceived 
      symptom-inducing foods than healthy children (median=2 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to 
      4]; chi(2)=28.6; P<0.001). Children with IBS avoided more foods (median=2 [25% to
      75% quartile=1 to 4]) than healthy children (median=0 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to
      2.75]; chi(2)=20.8; P<0.001). The number of self-perceived food intolerances was 
      weakly associated (r value range= -0.17 to 0.21) with pain frequency, pain
      severity, somatization, anxiety, functional disability, and decreased quality of 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBS have a high prevalence of self-perceived
      food intolerances. The number of these intolerances is weakly associated with
      measures of IBS severity.

TI  - Lactose and Fructose Intolerance in Turkish Children with Chronic Abdominal Pain.
PG  - 394-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of lactose and fructose intolerance in
      children with chronic abdominal pain. METHODS: Hydrogen breath tests were done to
      detect lactose and fructose malabsorption in 86 children with chronic abdominal
      pain (44 irritable bowel syndrome, 24 functional abdominal pain and 17 functional
      abdominal pain syndrome as per Rome III criteria) presenting to a Pediatric
      Gastroentreology department. RESULTS: 14 (16.3%) of patients were diagnosed with 
      lactose intolerance and 11 (12.8%) with fructose intolerance. CONCLUSION: Lactose
      and fructose intolerance in children can lead to chronic abdominal pain and
      symptoms improve with dietary modifications.

TI  - Prevalence of Lactose Malabsorption and Lactose Intolerance in Pediatric Patients
      with Selected Gastrointestinal Diseases.
PG  - 863-71
LID - 10.17219/acem/26337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactase is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of lactose.
      Deficiency of the enzyme (hypolactasia) may be determined genetically or arise
      secondarily to disease of small intestine. Under this condition, lactose enters
      the colon where it is fermented by intestinal microflora and turns to gases and
      short-chain fatty acids, causing gastrointestinal symptoms known as lactose
      intolerance (LI). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of lactose
      malabsorption (LM), LI and the coexistence of these two conditions in children
      with upper gastrointestinal tract diseases (UGTD), malabsorption syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gastrointestinal disorders
      (FGID). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hydrogen breath test (HBT) was conducted in 387
      pediatric patients in years 2010-2013. Two hundred thirty two children with
      gastrointestinal tract diseases were selected and assigned to groups - UGTD,
      malabsorption syndrome, IBD or FGID. For each group the frequency of LM,
      frequency and severity of LI and the frequency of their co-occurrence were
      calculated. RESULTS: Lactose malabsorption was observed in 37.08% of patients
      with gastrointestinal diseases. Positive HBT result was the most common in
      children with malabsorption syndrome (52.50%) and less common in UGTD (30.85%),
      especially in ulcer disease (23.53%). Symptoms after lactose ingestion affected
      36.64% of the subjects, and were more specific to lactose malabsorbers than to
      lactose absorbers (72.10% vs. 15.75%). The higher frequency of LI was noted in
      children with FGID, especially in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (65.22%). The
      lowest incidence of symptoms was obtained in children with UGTD, especially in
      those with ulcer disease (27.44%). The incidence of LM with LI was noted in
      27.16% of all patients and was the highest in IBS (47.83%) and the lowest in
      ulcer disease (15.78%). CONCLUSIONS: Lactose malabsorption is a common problem in
      children with gastrointestinal diseases, especially in children with bowel
      diseases. Lactose intolerance is related to LM, but does not affect all
      malabsorbers.

TI  - Comorbidities, Concomitant Medications, and Diet as Factors Affecting
      Levothyroxine Therapy: Results of the CONTROL Surveillance Project.
PG  - 53-68
LID - 10.1007/s40268-015-0116-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The CONTROL Surveillance Project was a comprehensive patient-based
      survey conducted among hypothyroid patients undergoing treatment. The primary
      objective of the study was to specifically quantify the prevalence of factors
      adversely affecting levothyroxine therapy. METHODS: Participants were selected
      from a large proprietary database. Those eligible for the study completed a
      21-question survey. RESULTS: Of the eligible hypothyroid patients, 925 (92.5%)
      were being treated with levothyroxine monotherapy. The mean age was 60.4 years;
      755 (81.6%) were female and 168 (18.2%) were male. Almost half of those receiving
      levothyroxine (435, 47.0%) had at least one comorbid condition that could
      adversely affect its absorption: gastroesophageal reflux disease (33.8% of
      patients), irritable bowel syndrome (9.7%), lactose intolerance (7.8%), or a
      history of gastric bypass surgery or bowel resection (3.0%). Other factors
      reported by many patients that could adversely affect levothyroxine absorption
      included use of prescription medications (20.6%) and over-the-counter medications
      (34.3%) used to treat comorbid gastrointestinal (GI) conditions; use of dietary
      supplements (51.8%, primarily calcium and iron); and intake of foods/beverages
      high in fiber, iodine, or soy (68.0%). Of the 13.4% who reported difficulty
      controlling their hypothyroid symptoms, significantly more patients with comorbid
      GI conditions reported such difficulty (7.8 versus 5.6%, P < 0.01). Frequent
      changes in levothyroxine dosing (two or more dose changes in the past year) were 
      reported by 8.0% of survey participants. Those with GI comorbidities were nearly 
      twice as likely to have such changes (5.0 versus 3.0%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:
      Better initial workup of patients, including identification of relevant GI
      comorbidities and allergies, may help in the early detection of factors that may 
      affect the performance of levothyroxine.

      perpetuating factor in IBS has gained recent interest, but food intolerance
      following gastroenteritis is less investigated. The aims of this study were
      firstly, to compare perceived food intolerance in a group previously exposed to
      Giardia lamblia with a control group; secondly, to explore the relation with IBS 
      status; and thirdly, to investigate associations with content of fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) in foods
      reported. METHODS: This is a historical cohort study with mailed questionnaire to
      1252 Giardia exposed and a control cohort matched by gender and age. Differences 
      between groups were investigated using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
      RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate in the exposed group was 65.3 %
      (817/1252) and in the control group 31.4 % (1128/3598). The adjusted odds ratio
      (OR) for perceived food intolerance for the exposed group was 2.00 with 95 %
      confidence interval (CI): 1.65 to 2.42, as compared with the control group.
      Perceived intolerance for dairy products was the most frequently reported
      intolerance, with an adjusted OR for the exposed of 1.95 (95 % CI: 1.51 to 2.51).
      Perceived intolerance for fatty foods, vegetables, fruit, cereals and alcohol was
      also significantly higher in the exposed group. The groups did not differ in
      perceived intolerance to spicy foods, coffee or soda. The association between
      exposure to Giardia infection and perceived food intolerance differed between the
      IBS group and the no-IBS group, but IBS was not a significant effect modifier for
      the association. Perceived intolerance for high FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.91)
      and low FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.55) was significantly associated with
      exposure status. CONCLUSION: Exposure to Giardia infection was associated with
      perceived food intolerance 3 years after giardiasis. IBS status did not alter the
      association between exposure status and perceived food intolerance. Perceived
      intolerance to high FODMAP foods and low FODMAP foods were both statistically
      significantly associated with exposure to Giardia infection.

AB  - Lactose intolerance is the most prevalent intestinal malabsorption disorder.
      After presentation of its history, the author describes the emergence of lactose 
      intolerance during the evolution of species, and the biochemistry of lactose as
      well as features of human and bacterial lactase enzymes are then described. The
      unequal distribution of lactose intolerance in different continents and
      population is discussed, followed by presentation of past and present prevalence 
      data in Hungary. Adult-type hypolactasia is caused by a polymorphism of the MCM6 
      gene located upstream from the lactase gene on the long arm of the chromosome 2. 
      It can be determined with the polymerase chain reaction. The intestinal symptoms 
      of lactose intolerance are well known, but its extra-intestinal manifestations
      are less recognised. Invasive diagnostic methods (determination of lactase
      activity from small intestinal biopsies, lactose tolerance test), are accurate,
      but have been replaced by the non-invasive methods; their gold standard is the H2
      breath test. Genetic testing is being used more and more frequently in Hungary
      too, and, presumably, the methane breath test will be also available in the near 
      future. Lactose intolerance can be accompanied by inflammatory bowel diseases,
      coeliac disease and irritable bowel syndrome; it could be established whether
      this association is causal or not in order to start a correct diet and therapy.

TI  - Low-FODMAP formula improves diarrhea and nutritional status in hospitalized
      patients receiving enteral nutrition: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind
      clinical trial.
PG  - 116

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and
      polyols (FODMAPs) are poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates that play an
      important role in inducing functional gut symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet improves
      abdominal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable
      bowel syndrome. However, there were no study for the effect of FODMAP content on 
      gastrointestinal intolerance and nutritional status in patients receiving enteral
      nutrition (EN). METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 14-day
      clinical trial, eligible hospitalized patients receiving EN (n = 100) were
      randomly assigned to three groups; 84 patients completed the trial (low-FODMAP
      EN, n = 30; moderate-FODMAP EN, n = 28; high-FODMAP EN, n = 26). Anthropometric
      and biochemical parameters were measured; stool assessment was performed using
      the King's Stool Chart and clinical definition. RESULTS: Baseline values were not
      significantly different among the three groups. After the 14-day intervention,
      diarrhea significantly improved in the low-FODMAP group than in the moderate- and
      high-FODMAP groups (P < 0.05). King's Stool scores in diarrhea subjects were
      significantly and steadily reduced in the low-FODMAP group compared with the
      other two groups (P for time and EN type interaction <0.05). BMI increased
      significantly in the low- and high-FODMAP groups during the intervention (P <
      0.05 for both), and showed a trend toward increasing in the moderate-FODMAP group
      (P < 0.10). Serum prealbumin increased significantly in all groups by 14-day; by 
      3-day, it had increased to the levels at 14-day in the low-FODMAP group. At
      14-day, serum transferrin had increased significantly in the moderate-FODMAP
      group. In addition, subjects were classified by final condition (unimproved,
      normal maintenance, diarrhea only improved, constipation only improved, and
      recurrent diarrhea/constipation improved). Seventy-five percent of the diarrhea
      improved group consumed the low-FODMAP EN formula. 38.5 and 46.2% of recurrent
      diarrhea/constipation improved group consumed the low- and moderate-FODMAP EN
      respectively. BMI significantly increased in all groups except the unimproved.
      Prealbumin levels significantly increased in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent 
      diarrhea/constipation groups at 3-day and continued by 14-day, and in the
      constipation-improved group at 14-day. Transferrin levels significantly increased
      in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent diarrhea/constipation groups at 14-day.
      CONCLUSION: Low-FODMAP EN may improve diarrhea, leading to improved nutritional
      status and facilitating prompt recovery from illness.

TI  - Lactose Intolerance in Adults: Biological Mechanism and Dietary Management.
PG  - 8020-35
LID - 10.3390/nu7095380 [doi]
AB  - Lactose intolerance related to primary or secondary lactase deficiency is
      characterized by abdominal pain and distension, borborygmi, flatus, and diarrhea 
      induced by lactose in dairy products. The biological mechanism and lactose
      malabsorption is established and several investigations are available, including 
      genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. Lactose intolerance depends not only
      on the expression of lactase but also on the dose of lactose, intestinal flora,
      gastrointestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and sensitivity 
      of the gastrointestinal tract to the generation of gas and other fermentation
      products of lactose digestion. Treatment of lactose intolerance can include
      lactose-reduced diet and enzyme replacement. This is effective if symptoms are
      only related to dairy products; however, lactose intolerance can be part of a
      wider intolerance to variably absorbed, fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides 
      and polyols (FODMAPs). This is present in at least half of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and this group requires not only restriction of
      lactose intake but also a low FODMAP diet to improve gastrointestinal complaints.
      The long-term effects of a dairy-free, low FODMAPs diet on nutritional health and
      the fecal microbiome are not well defined. This review summarizes recent advances
      in our understanding of the genetic basis, biological mechanism, diagnosis and
      dietary management of lactose intolerance.

TI  - The management of lactose intolerance among primary care physicians and its
      correlation with management by gastroenterologists: the SEPD-SEMG national
      survey.
PG  - 554-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The understanding of lactose intolerance (LI) is limited
      in some professional settings. Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva (SEPD)
      and Sociedad Espanola de Medicina General (SEMG) have developed a survey in order
      to: a) Analyze primary care physicians (PCPs) knowledge and clinical management; 
      and b) to compare results with those of a previous survey of Spanish
      gastroenterologists (GEs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent
      to SEMG members with 27 items on various issues: Demographics, occupational
      characteristics, outlook on LI, diagnostic tests, treatment, and follow-up.
      Results were compared to those from a survey of GEs. RESULTS: A total of 456 PCPs
      responded, versus 477 GEs. PCPs had an older mean age and longer professional
      experience. Level of understanding of LI was similar, albeit a higher proportion 
      of PCPs lacked epidemiological awareness (p < 0.01). GEs tended to consider LI a 
      "minor" condition (71.3 vs. 40.1%; p > 0.001), and LI symptoms as overlapping
      those of irritable bowel syndrome (93.5 vs. 88.2%; p = 0.005), although symptoms 
      perceived as suspicious of LI were similar in both groups. Dietary
      recommendations were recognized as the primary therapeutic approach. CONCLUSION: 
      This study reveals the outlook of PCPs on LI, and allows comparison with that of 
      GEs, as a basis for the development of strategies aimed at improving LI
      understanding, approach and management in our setting.

TI  - Frequency and Cause of Persistent Symptoms in Celiac Disease Patients on a
      Long-term Gluten-free Diet.
PG  - 239-43
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000392 [doi]
AB  - GOALS: To estimate the frequency and cause of nonresponsive celiac disease (CD). 
      BACKGROUND: Treatment of CD is based on life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet
      (GFD). Some celiac patients experience persistence of symptoms despite a GFD.
      This condition is defined as nonresponsive CD. STUDY: Celiac patients on a GFD
      for at least 12 months underwent diet compliance assessment, laboratory tests,
      breath tests, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations according to the
      symptoms/signs reported. RESULTS: Seventy of 321 (21.8%) patients had persistent 
      or recurrent symptoms/signs. The cause of symptom persistence was evaluated in 56
      of 70 patients. Thirteen of 56 (23%) patients were antiendomysial antibody
      positive. Among the patients with negative serology, 1 had fibromyalgia, and 3
      had evidence that disproved the diagnosis of CD. The remaining 39 patients with
      negative serology underwent duodenal biopsy sampling, which evidenced histologic 
      alterations in 24 patients. Among the 15 patients with normal histology 3 were
      lactose intolerant, 9 had irritable bowel syndrome, 2 had gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, and in 1 patient a cause for the persistent symptom was not identified. 
      In patients with confirmed diagnosis of CD, exposure to dietary gluten was the
      main cause of persistence of symptoms/signs, and consistently after dietary
      modification, symptoms resolved in 63% of the patients at later time points
      during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Nonresponsive CD occurs in nearly one fifth of
      celiac patients on GFD and its occurrence suggests further investigations to
      optimize the management of celiac patients.

TI  - Does a low FODMAP diet help IBS?
PG  - 93-6
LID - 10.1136/dtb.2015.8.0346 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that can have a significant 
      impact on a person's quality of life. The cause of IBS is unknown but several
      mechanisms have been proposed including visceral hypersensitivity, central
      sensitisation, abnormal gut motility and altered gut microbiota. IBS is
      challenging to manage and many patients report insufficient symptomatic relief
      from treatment. Approximately 60% of patients identify food as a trigger for
      their symptoms, and there has been interest in exclusion diets for managing IBS. 
      Dietary adaptation is a common self-management strategy for patients with IBS,
      with many self-diagnosing intolerance to specific foods. This may lead to
      patients adopting over-restrictive or inappropriate diets. In recent years, a
      diet low in poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates, known collectively as
      FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and
      polyols), has been advocated for the treatment of IBS. Here, we discuss the
      background to the FODMAP diet and review the evidence supporting its use for
      people with IBS.

TI  - Recent developments in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 7621-36
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i25.7621 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, the
      pathophysiology of which is not completely known, although it has been shown that
      genetic/social learning factors, diet, intestinal microbiota, intestinal
      low-grade inflammation, and abnormal gastrointestinal endocrine cells play a
      major role. Studies of familial aggregation and on twins have confirmed the
      heritability of IBS. However, the proposed IBS risk genes are thus far
      nonvalidated hits rather than true predisposing factors. There is no convincing
      evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, with the effect 
      exerted by diet seemingly caused by intake of poorly absorbed carbohydrates and
      fiber. Obesity is a possible comorbidity of IBS. Differences in the microbiota
      between IBS patients and healthy controls have been reported, but the association
      between IBS symptoms and specific bacterial species is uncertain. Low-grade
      inflammation appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of a major subset of
      IBS, namely postinfectious IBS. The density of intestinal endocrine cells is
      reduced in patients with IBS, possibly as a result of genetic factors, diet,
      intestinal microbiota, and low-grade inflammation interfering with the regulatory
      signals controlling the intestinal stem-cell clonogenic and differentiation
      activities. Furthermore, there is speculation that this decreased number of
      endocrine cells is responsible for the visceral hypersensitivity, disturbed
      gastrointestinal motility, and abnormal gut secretion seen in IBS patients.

      in irritable bowel syndrome patients with diarrhea.
PG  - 7563-70
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i24.7563 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To validate 4-sample lactose hydrogen breath testing (4SLHBT) compared to
      standard 13-sample LHBT in the clinical setting. METHODS: Irritable bowel
      syndrome patients with diarrhea (IBS-D) and healthy volunteers (HVs) were
      enrolled and received a 10 g, 20 g, or 40 g dose lactose hydrogen breath test
      (LHBT) in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. The lactase gene
      promoter region was sequenced. Breath samples and symptoms were acquired at
      baseline and every 15 min for 3 h (13 measurements). The detection rates of
      lactose malabsorption (LM) and lactose intolerance (LI) for a 4SLHBT that
      acquired four measurements at 0, 90, 120, and 180 min from the same data set were
      compared with the results of standard LHBT. RESULTS: Sixty IBS-D patients and 60 
      HVs were studied. The genotype in all participants was C/C-13910. LM and LI
      detection rates increased with lactose dose from 10 g, 20 g to 40 g in both
      groups (P < 0.001). 4SLHBT showed excellent diagnostic concordance with standard 
      LHBT (97%-100%, Kappa 0.815-0.942) with high sensitivity (90%-100%) and
      specificity (100%) at all three lactose doses in both groups. CONCLUSION:
      Reducing the number of measurements from 13 to 4 samples did not significantly
      impact on the accuracy of LHBT in health and IBS-D. 4SLHBT is a valid test for
      assessment of LM and LI in clinical practice.

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i23.7089 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders, having a prevalence of 12%-30% in the general population. Most
      patients with IBS attribute their symptoms to adverse food reactions. We review
      the role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS and the importance of dietary factors
      in the management of these patients. The MEDLINE electronic database (1966 to Jan
      2015) was searched using the following keywords: "food", "diet", "food allergy", 
      "food hypersensitivity", "food intolerance", "IBS", "epidemiology",
      "pathogenesis", "pathophysiology", "diagnosis", "treatment". We found 153
      eligible papers; 80 were excluded because: not written in English, exclusive
      biochemical and experimental research, case reports, reviews, and research
      otherwise not relevant to our specific interest. We selected 73 papers: 43
      original papers, 26 reviews and 4 letters to the editor. These papers focused on 
      IBS pathogenesis, the association between IBS and atopy, and between IBS and food
      allergy, the relationship between IBS and non-celiac wheat sensitivity, the role 
      of diet in IBS. Pending further scientific evidence, a cautious approach is
      advisable but the concept of food allergy should be included as a possible cause 
      of IBS, and a dietary approach may have a place in the routine clinical
      management of IBS.

TI  - Quantifying bile acid malabsorption helps predict response and tailor sequestrant
      therapy.
PG  - 252-7
LID - 10.7861/clinmedicine.15-3-252 [doi]
AB  - Although recognised as a cause of chronic diarrhoea for over forty years,
      diagnostic tests and treatments for bile acid malabsorption (BAM) remain
      controversial. Recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
      guidelines highlighted the lack of evidence in the field, and called for further 
      research. This retrospective study explores the BAM subtype and severity, the use
      and response to bile acid sequestrants (BAS) and the prevalence of abnormal
      colonic histology. 264 selenium-75-labelled homocholic acid conjugated taurine
      (SeHCAT)-tested patient records were reviewed and the severity and subtype of
      BAM, presence of colonic histopathology and response to BAS were recorded. 53% of
      patients tested had BAM, with type-2 BAM in 45% of patients with presumed
      irritable bowel syndrome. Colonic histological abnormalities were similar overall
      between patients with (29%) or without (23%) BAM (p = 0.46) and between BAM
      subtypes, with no significant presence of inflammatory changes. 63% of patients
      with BAM had a successful BAS response which showed a trend to decreased response
      with reduced severity. Colestyramine was unsuccessful in 44% (38/87) and 45% of
      these (17/38) were related to medication intolerance, despite a positive SeHCAT. 
      47% (7/15) of colestyramine failures had a successful colesevelam response. No
      patient reported colesevelam intolerance. Quantifying severity of BAM appears to 
      be useful in predicting BAS response. Colesevelam was better tolerated than
      colestyramine and showed some efficacy in colestyramine failures. Colestyramine
      failure should not be used to exclude BAM. Colonic histology is of no relevance.

TI  - Self-reported dietary fructose intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome: Proposed 
      diagnostic criteria.
PG  - 5677-84
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i18.5677 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To study the criteria for self-reported dietary fructose intolerance (DFI)
      and to evaluate subjective global assessment (SGA) as outcome measure. METHODS:
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients were randomized in an open study design
      with a 2 wk run-in on a habitual IBS diet, followed by 12 wk with/without
      additional fructose-reduced diet (FRD). Daily registrations of stool frequency
      and consistency, and symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) were performed
      during the first 4 wk. SGA was used for weekly registrations during the whole
      study period. Provocation with high-fructose diet was done at the end of the
      registration period. Fructose breath tests (FBTs) were performed. A total of 182 
      subjects performed the study according to the protocol (88 FRD, 94 controls).
      RESULTS: We propose a new clinically feasible diagnostic standard for
      self-reported fructose intolerance. The instrument is based on VAS registrations 
      of symptom relief on FRD combined with symptom aggravation upon provocation with 
      fructose-rich diet. Using these criteria 43 of 77 patients (56%) in the present
      cohort of IBS patients had self-reported DFI. To improve the concept for clinical
      evaluation, we translated the SGA scale instrument to Norwegian and validated it 
      in the context of the IBS diet regimen. The validation procedures showed a
      sensitivity, specificity and kappa value for SGA detecting the self-reported DFI 
      group by FRD response within the IBS patients of 0.79, 0.75 and 0.53,
      respectively. Addition of the provocation test yielded values of 0.84, 0.76 and
      0.61, respectively. The corresponding validation results for FBT were 0.57, 0.34 
      and -0.13, respectively. CONCLUSION: FRD improves symptoms in a subgroup of IBS
      patients. A diet trial followed by a provocation test evaluated by SGA can
      identify most responders to FRD.

TI  - Diet in irritable bowel syndrome.

LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0022-3 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that
      is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits 
      and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent
      developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of
      IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food
      allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new 
      diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that
      triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS
      appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a
      gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly
      absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and
      insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and
      insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and
      provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production,
      abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble
      fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. 
      Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the
      abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal
      endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake
      are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would
      expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain.
      However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual
      dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in
      combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for 
      IBS patients.

AB  - Educational programs have been used as a control condition in trials on
      psychological therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). An optimal control
      condition should have all logistic features of the experimental intervention,
      except the active component, but also have basic therapeutic benefit for the
      patient. The aim of the present study is to systematically determine patients'
      educational needs on the basis of the (mis)conceptions that they have of their
      disease and their reported desire for information to optimize the control
      intervention in IBS research. A systematic review of studies on the knowledge and
      educational needs of IBS patients in terms of their condition was performed.
      Studies published as full text in the English language in peer-reviewed journals 
      and that included adult IBS patients diagnosed according to the Manning or Rome
      I, II, or III criteria were selected. Eight studies involving 2132 patients were 
      included. When focusing on misconceptions of patients, the most prevalent are
      that IBS is caused by dietary factors, food allergies and intolerance (37-90%),
      heredity (52%), or a lack of digestive enzymes (52%); IBS is a form of colitis
      (43%); and will last a lifetime (31-54%), develop into cancer (15-49%), or
      worsens with age (48%). Patients are 'unhappy' with their level of knowledge or
      feel poorly informed (65%). They want information about the diagnostic process,
      which foods to avoid (63%), causes (62%), coping strategies (59%), new
      medications (55%), course (52%), and the role of psychological factors (51%). IBS
      patients do have a large variety of educational needs. Educational programs
      optimally addressing these needs can be used adequately as a placebo control
      condition in research on psychological interventions.

PG  - 20-23
LID - 10.17116/terarkh201587220-23 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To establish the rate of lactase deficiency (LD) in patients with
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), to define a role of enteric
      bacteria in the pathogenesis of hypolactasia, and to evaluate the efficiency of
      probiotic therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Examinations were made in 386 patients
      with PI-IBS, including 112 (79.4%) women; mean age 33.9 +/- 9.1 years; disease
      duration 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. Rapid tests of small intestinal mucosa (SIM) biopsy
      specimens obtained from the duodenal retrobulbar segment were used to diagnose
      LD. Bacterial growth was estimated by a hydrogen breath test using a H2 MICRO gas
      analyzer. RESULTS: The patients with PI-IBS were revealed to have moderate and
      severe LD in 25.6 and 10.9%, respectively. All the patients with LD were detected
      to have small intestinal (SI) bacterial overgrowth (BOG). An inverse correlation 
      was found between LD and the degree of SI BOG (r = -0.53; p < 0.001). 73.7% of
      the patients with moderate LD showed a positive effect of probiotic therapy as
      regression of clinical symptoms of LD, a decrease of hydrogen levels in expired
      air from 72.4 +/- 25.1 to 16.41 +/- 3.2 ppm (p < 0.05), an increase of lactate
      activity in the SIM biopsy specimens and an improvement of quality of life from
      2.69 +/- 0.53 to 5.53 +/- 0.64 scores according to the GCI scale. No improvement 
      occurred in 73.8% of the patients with severe LD. CONCLUSION: LD was identified
      in 36.5% of the patients with PI-IBS. There was an inverse correlation between
      the degree of LD and SI BOG. The good therapeutic effect of probiotics in LD
      suggests that the symbiotic gut microflora positively affects the activity of
      lactase in the human SIM. No therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with
      severe LN serves as the basis for a search for more active probiotic therapy.

AB  - Wheat-related disorders have become a growing area of clinical and scientific
      interest and can be categorized broadly as: autoimmune-mediated; allergic; and
      non-autoimmune/non-allergic conditions. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and 
      non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) present on this spectrum as disorders
      associated with adverse gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations
      following exposure to gluten and/or other wheat-related constituents. NCGS/NCWS
      is increasingly considered in patients with unexplained symptoms after the
      exclusions of celiac disease and wheat allergy. As objective diagnostic data and 
      specific biomarkers are lacking, response to a gluten-free/wheat-free diet can
      confirm the presence of NCGS/NCWS. An association with irritable bowel syndrome
      has been detected, and the effects of other food components, such as fermentable 
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, may contribute.
      Our organization and synthesis of extant knowledge pertaining to wheat-related
      disorders may advance current practice and research efforts toward an improved
      understanding of NCGS/NCWS as an evolving clinical entity.

TI  - Systematic review: noncoeliac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 807-20
LID - 10.1111/apt.13155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a controversial emerging
      disorder. Despite reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten, NCGS
      remains a diagnosis based on the exclusion of coeliac disease, given the absence 
      of reliable biomarkers. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence, diagnostic exclusion of 
      coeliac disease and the efficacy of a gluten-free diet (GFD) for NCGS patients.
      METHODS: A PubMed search was performed up to December 2014. According to
      consensus diagnostic criteria, NCGS was defined as self-reported gluten
      intolerance, negative coeliac serology and absence of villous atrophy. Studies
      evaluating the impact of a GFD on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      were also included. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of NCGS (0.5-13%) differed widely. 
      Seventeen studies, including 1561 patients (26 children), met the inclusion
      criteria for NCGS. HLA haplotypes could not be linked to histology [normal or
      lymphocytic enteritis (LE)] in 1123 NCGS patients. HLADQ2/DQ8 haplotypes were
      present in 44% of NCGS patients. After advanced diagnostic techniques in 189 NCGS
      patients combining LE and HLADQ2/DQ8 haplotypes, 39 (20%) were reclassified as
      coeliac disease. There was a higher than expected family history of coeliac
      disease and autoimmune disorders in NCGS patients. A GFD resulted in variable
      results for variable, but significantly improved stool frequency in HLADQ2
      positive diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates for
      NCGS are extremely variable. A subset of NCGS patients might belong in the
      so-called 'coeliac-lite' disease. The benefit of a GFD for NCGS patients is
      currently controversial. HLADQ2 positive diarrhoea-type IBS patients might gain
      symptom improvement from a GFD.

TI  - Role of FODMAPs in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
PG  - 665-82
LID - 10.1177/0884533615569886 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition characterized by abdominal pain,
      bloating, flatus, and altered bowel habits. The role of dietary components in
      inducing IBS symptoms is difficult to explore. To date, foods are not considered 
      a cause but rather symptom-triggering factors. Particular interest has been given
      to the so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and
      polyols). We aimed to summarize the evidence from the most common approaches to
      manage suspected food intolerance in IBS, with a particular interest in the role 
      of FODMAPs and the effects of a low FODMAP diet. We reviewed literature,
      consulting PubMed and Medline by using the search terms FODMAP(s), fructose,
      lactose, fructans, galactans, polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol,
      erythritol, polydextrose, and isomalt), irritable bowel syndrome, and functional 
      gastrointestinal symptoms. FODMAP-restricted diets have been used for a long time
      to manage patients with IBS. The innovation in the so-called FODMAP concept is
      that a global restriction should have a more consistent effect than a limited one
      in preventing abdominal distension. Even though all the potential low FODMAP
      diets provide good relief of symptoms in many patients, there is just a little
      relief in others. Several studies highlight the role of low FODMAP diets to
      improve symptoms in patients with IBS. The evidence on this dietary approach
      supports the hypothesis that a low FODMAP diet should be the first dietary
      approach. However, many points remain to be clarified, including the evaluation
      of possibly significant nutrition concerns.

TI  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as an uncommon cause of false positive
      lactose hydrogen breath test among patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome in Asia.
PG  - 995-1000
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: It has been reported that small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to false positive diagnoses of lactose malabsorption
      (LM) in irritable bowel syndrome patients. The aim of this study was to determine
      the influence of SIBO on lactose hydrogen breath test (HBT) results in these
      patients. METHODS: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients with
      abnormal lactose HBTs ingested a test meal containing (99m) Tc and lactose. The
      location of the test meal and the breath levels of hydrogen were recorded
      simultaneously by scintigraphic scanning and lactose HBT, respectively. The
      increase in hydrogen concentration was not considered to be caused by SIBO if >/=
      10% of (99m) Tc accumulated in the cecal region at the time or before of abnormal
      lactose HBT. RESULTS: LM was present in 84% (31/37) of irritable bowel syndrome
      patients. Twenty of these patients agreed to measurement of oro-cecal transit
      time. Only three patients (15%) with abnormal lactose HBT might have had SIBO.
      The median oro-cecal transit time between LM and lactose intolerance patients
      were 75 min and 45 min, respectively (Z=2.545, P=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Most of
      irritable bowel syndrome patients with an abnormal lactose HBT had LM. SIBO had
      little impact on the interpretation of lactose HBTs. The patients with lactose
      intolerance had faster small intestinal transit than LM patients.

TI  - Review article: the diagnosis and management of food allergy and food
      intolerances.
PG  - 3-25
LID - 10.1111/apt.12984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse reactions to food include immune mediated food allergies and 
      non-immune mediated food intolerances. Food allergies and intolerances are often 
      confused by health professionals, patients and the public. AIM: To critically
      review the data relating to diagnosis and management of food allergy and food
      intolerance in adults and children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane
      Database were searched up until May 2014, using search terms related to food
      allergy and intolerance. RESULTS: An estimated one-fifth of the population
      believe that they have adverse reactions to food. Estimates of true IgE-mediated 
      food allergy vary, but in some countries it may be as prevalent as 4-7% of
      preschool children. The most common food allergens are cow's milk, egg, peanut,
      tree nuts, soy, shellfish and finned fish. Reactions vary from urticaria to
      anaphylaxis and death. Tolerance for many foods including milk and egg develops
      with age, but is far less likely with peanut allergy. Estimates of IgE-mediated
      food allergy in adults are closer to 1-2%. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies such
      as Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome are rarer and predominantly
      recognised in childhood. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders including
      eosinophilic oesophagitis are mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergic
      conditions, and are improved by dietary exclusions. By contrast food intolerances
      are nonspecific, and the resultant symptoms resemble other common medically
      unexplained complaints, often overlapping with symptoms found in functional
      disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Improved dietary treatments for the
      irritable bowel syndrome have recently been described. CONCLUSIONS: Food
      allergies are more common in children, can be life-threatening and are distinct
      from food intolerances. Food intolerances may pose little risk but since
      functional disorders are so prevalent, greater efforts to understand adverse
      effects of foods in functional disorders are warranted.

AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized pain accompanied by
      a broad symptomatologic spectrum. Besides chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances,
      headaches and cognitive dysfunction that are extensively described in the
      literature, a considerable proportion of patients with fibromyalgia experience
      gastrointestinal symptoms that are commonly overlooked in the studies that are
      not specifically dedicated to evaluate these manifestations. Nevertheless,
      various attempts were undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal dimension of
      fibromyalgia. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated comorbidity of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among patients with fibromyalgia. Other studies
      have investigated the frequency of presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in
      fibromyalgia in a nonspecific approach describing several gastrointestinal
      complaints frequently reported by these patients such as abdominal pain,
      dyspepsia and bowel changes, among others. Several underlying mechanisms that
      require further investigation could serve as potential explanatory hypotheses for
      the appearance of such manifestations. These include sensitivity to dietary
      constituents such as gluten, lactose or FODMAPs or alterations in the brain-gut
      axis as a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or subclinical enteric 
      infections such as giardiasis. The gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia
      constitutes a relevant element of the multidisciplinary pathophysiologic
      mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia that need to be unveiled, as this would
      contribute to the adequate designation of relevant treatment alternatives
      corresponding to these manifestations.
