AB  - The controversial effects of dietary fiber on symptoms in functional
      gastrointestinal disorders are summarized. Studies concerning adverse reaction to
      foods are mentioned and the possible role of food allergy and food intolerances, 
      especially pseudoallergic reactions to biogenes amines, in symptom provocation is
      discussed. The known effects of lactose deficiency and fructose malabsorption are
      reviewed. The FODMAP concept (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and
      polyols) is presented in more detail and recent studies on pathophysiological
      effects of FODMAP constituents and of therapeutic effects of a low FODMAP diet on
      symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are discussed. Finally,
      studies on the new disorder non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are summarized
      and the state of the discussion whether wheat intolerance is due to gluten or the
      grains is given.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse reactions to food include immune mediated food allergies and 
      non-immune mediated food intolerances. Food allergies and intolerances are often 
      confused by health professionals, patients and the public. AIM: To critically
      review the data relating to diagnosis and management of food allergy and food
      intolerance in adults and children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane
      Database were searched up until May 2014, using search terms related to food
      allergy and intolerance. RESULTS: An estimated one-fifth of the population
      believe that they have adverse reactions to food. Estimates of true IgE-mediated 
      food allergy vary, but in some countries it may be as prevalent as 4-7% of
      preschool children. The most common food allergens are cow's milk, egg, peanut,
      tree nuts, soy, shellfish and finned fish. Reactions vary from urticaria to
      anaphylaxis and death. Tolerance for many foods including milk and egg develops
      with age, but is far less likely with peanut allergy. Estimates of IgE-mediated
      food allergy in adults are closer to 1-2%. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies such
      as Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome are rarer and predominantly
      recognised in childhood. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders including
      eosinophilic oesophagitis are mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergic
      conditions, and are improved by dietary exclusions. By contrast food intolerances
      are nonspecific, and the resultant symptoms resemble other common medically
      unexplained complaints, often overlapping with symptoms found in functional
      disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Improved dietary treatments for the
      irritable bowel syndrome have recently been described. CONCLUSIONS: Food
      allergies are more common in children, can be life-threatening and are distinct
      from food intolerances. Food intolerances may pose little risk but since
      functional disorders are so prevalent, greater efforts to understand adverse
      effects of foods in functional disorders are warranted.

TI  - The role of food intolerance in functional gastrointestinal disorders in
      children.
PG  - 686-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) is a common, benign,
      chronic diagnosis that has a significant negative impact on quality of life.
      FGIDs that develop in childhood can persist into adulthood. Currently, there is
      no cure and few treatment options are available. OBJECTIVE: This article provides
      an outline of current research supporting the role of food intolerance in
      children with FGIDs. DISCUSSION: Food intolerances have long been reported by
      patients with FGIDs; however, randomised controlled trials are lacking in this
      area. Food intolerances that have been investigated include intolerance to food
      chemicals, lactose, fructose and, more recently, fer-mentable carbohydrates,
      termed FODMAPs. The low-FODMAP diet eliminates poorly absorbed short-chain
      carbohydrates and has a clearly defined mechanism of action. Emerging evidence
      suggests it alleviates symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and,
      potentially, also in children. However, more evidence is required for the
      efficacy of the diet in children and in oth-er subgroups of FGID. Any dietary
      restriction in growing children should be undertaken with clinical supervision by
      a dietitian.

TI  - Abnormal accumulation of intestinal fluid following ingestion of an unabsorbable 
      carbohydrate in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: an MRI study.
PG  - 1686-93
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postprandial discomfort following intake of poorly absorbable, but
      fermentable carbohydrates is a common complaint in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). We used lactulose as a model substance for this group of symptom 
      triggering carbohydrates, aiming to visualize the intestinal response in IBS
      patients compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with IBS according to
      Rome III criteria (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 16) underwent a lactulose
      challenge test. By using magnetic resonance imaging, we measured small bowel
      water content (SBWC), and distension (diameter) of the distal ileum and the
      colon, both in fasting state and 1 h after ingestion of 10 g lactulose. We
      recorded symptoms after lactulose ingestion. KEY RESULTS: Lactulose provoked
      significantly more symptoms in IBS patients than in healthy controls (p <
      0.0001). SBWC increased more in the patient group compared to the control group
      (p = 0.0005). The postprandial diameter of the terminal ileum was larger in
      patients with IBS and the postprandial diameter of the ascending colon was
      smaller in patients with diarrhea-predominant phenotype (IBS-D). Symptoms were
      not correlated with change in SBWC (r = 0.05; p = 0.11), nor to the diameters of 
      the terminal ileum or the colon. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Compared to healthy
      controls, IBS patients developed more symptoms and had an abnormal accumulation
      of fluid in the small bowel in response to ingestion of the unabsorbable
      carbohydrate lactulose. This may be due to impaired motor activity of the small
      intestine or impaired function of the ileocecal segment.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most prevalent functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. It is a multifactorial disorder with its pathogenesis
      attributed to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation,
      visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on.
      Traditionally, IBS has been treated with diet and lifestyle modification, fiber
      supplementation, psychological therapy, and pharmacological treatment.
      Carbohydrates are intermingled with a wide range of regularly consumed food
      including grains such as rye and wheat, vegetables, fruits, and legumes.
      Short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the
      intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by
      bacteria with consequent gas production. These effects may be the basis for the
      induction of most of the gastrointestinal symptoms. This has led to the use of
      lactose-free diets in those with lactose intolerance and of fructose-reduced
      diets for fructose malabsorption. As all poorly absorbed short-chain
      carbohydrates have similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has
      been developed to regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a
      dietary approach that restricts them all. Based on the observational and
      comparative studies, and randomized-controlled trials, FODMAPs have been shown to
      trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. Food choice via the low
      FODMAPs and potentially other dietary strategies is now a realistic and
      efficacious therapeutic approach for managing symptoms of IBS.

AB  - A chronic continuous or intermittent gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, the
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), appears to be due to dysregulation of
      brain-gut-microbiota communication. Furthermore, the "microbiota" greatly impacts
      the bi-directional brain-gut axis communication. This article describes IBS in
      relation to similar diseases, presents the background to osteopathy, and proposes
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to manage IBS. In IBS, OMT focuses on
      the nervous and circulatory systems, spine, viscera, and thoracic and pelvic
      diaphragms in order to restore homeostatic balance, normalize autonomic activity 
      in the intestine, promote lymphatic flow, and address somatic dysfunction.
      Lymphatic and venous congestion are treated by the lymphatic pump techniques and 
      stimulation of Chapmans reflex points. A simple treatment plan designed to lessen
      chronic pain and inflammation in IBS is presented based on current evidence-based
      literature. Since food itself, food allergies, and intolerance could contribute
      to symptom onset or even cause IBS, this article also provides dietary
      modifications to consider for patients.

AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized pain accompanied by
      a broad symptomatologic spectrum. Besides chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances,
      headaches and cognitive dysfunction that are extensively described in the
      literature, a considerable proportion of patients with fibromyalgia experience
      gastrointestinal symptoms that are commonly overlooked in the studies that are
      not specifically dedicated to evaluate these manifestations. Nevertheless,
      various attempts were undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal dimension of
      fibromyalgia. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated comorbidity of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among patients with fibromyalgia. Other studies
      have investigated the frequency of presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in
      fibromyalgia in a nonspecific approach describing several gastrointestinal
      complaints frequently reported by these patients such as abdominal pain,
      dyspepsia and bowel changes, among others. Several underlying mechanisms that
      require further investigation could serve as potential explanatory hypotheses for
      the appearance of such manifestations. These include sensitivity to dietary
      constituents such as gluten, lactose or FODMAPs or alterations in the brain-gut
      axis as a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or subclinical enteric 
      infections such as giardiasis. The gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia
      constitutes a relevant element of the multidisciplinary pathophysiologic
      mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia that need to be unveiled, as this would
      contribute to the adequate designation of relevant treatment alternatives
      corresponding to these manifestations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The importance of lactose malabsorption in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) is not well defined and these patients often complain of lactose
      intolerance. To objectively measure lactose malabsorption, a hydrogen breath test
      (HBT) can be performed, but a discrepancy emerges between the results of the HBT 
      and the symptomatic response during the HBT. AIMS: To determine in a group of IBS
      patients whether self-perceived lactose intolerance and the symptomatic response 
      to lactose HBT were conditioned by other factors besides the presence of lactose 
      malabsorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral challenge to lactose (50 g) was tested
      in 51 IBS patients to assess HBT malabsorption and the symptomatic response to
      lactose intolerance was scored on a validated questionnaire. Allergological
      screening for common inhalants and food allergens (including cow's milk) was
      performed. The presence of psychological factors (e.g. anxiety, depression,
      fatigue) was evaluated using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 21 out
      of 51 patients (41.1%) were self-perceived to be lactose intolerant, 24/51 (47%) 
      had a positive HBT, and 14/51 (27.4%) presented with symptoms of lactose
      intolerance during HBT. The serological screening for inhalant and food allergens
      was positive in 6/21 (28.6%) and 4/21 (19%) of patients who self-perceived
      lactose intolerance and in 5/14 (37.5%) and 3/14 (21.4%) in intolerant patients
      symptomatic during HBT. Only 1/51 (1.9%) presented evidence of IgE-mediated
      hypersensitivity to cow's milk. Patients who experienced symptoms of lactose
      intolerance during HBT presented more severe IBS symptoms [326 (296-398) vs. 215 
      (126-295) P=0.05] and a higher score of anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Factors
      influencing the symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT resulted in an
      increase in hydrogen produced and in the severity of IBS. CONCLUSION: In a cohort
      of 51 IBS patients, the symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT were
      influenced by the capacity to absorb lactose and the severity of IBS. Other
      factors, such as the psychological status or an adverse reaction to milk, merit
      consideration as potential cofactors involved in lactose perception and
      tolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated suspected food intolerances in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for
      real-time visualization of structural/functional changes in the intestinal mucosa
      after food challenge. Patients with functional changes after food challenge
      (CLE+) were placed on personalized exclusion diets and followed up for long-term 
      symptom relief. METHODS: Thirty-six IBS patients with suspected food intolerance 
      and 10 patients with Barrett's esophagus (controls) without IBS symptoms were
      examined by CLE at University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany).
      Diluted food antigens were administered directly to the duodenal mucosa through
      the working channel of the endoscope. Epithelial breaks, intervillous spaces, and
      the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were measured before and after
      the food challenge. CLE+ patients were placed on exclusion diets, given symptom
      score questionnaires, and followed up for 1 year; controls resumed their previous
      diet. RESULTS: CLE showed a real-time response to food antigens in 22 of 36
      patients; no responses were observed in 14 of 36 patients (CLE-) or any of the
      controls. Baseline IELs were significantly higher in CLE+ than CLE- subjects (P =
      .004); numbers increased significantly after food challenge (P = .0008). Within 5
      minutes of exposure of CLE+ patients to food antigens, IELs increased, epithelial
      leaks/gaps formed, and intervillous spaces widened. Epithelial leaks and
      intervillous spaces also increased significantly in CLE+ vs baseline (both P <
      .001). The concordance of IELs measured by CLE and conventional histology was
      70.6%; they did not correlate (P = .89; r(2) = 0.027). Symptom scores improved
      more than 50% in CLE+ patients after a 4-week exclusion diet and increased to 74%
      at 12 months; symptoms continued in CLE- patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CLE
      analysis of IBS patients with a suspected food intolerance, exposure to candidate
      food antigens caused immediate breaks, increased intervillous spaces, and
      increased IELs in the intestinal mucosa. These changes are associated with
      patient responses to exclusion diets. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      disorders in Western countries. Despite the high prevalence of this disorders,
      the therapeutic management of these patients is often unsatisfactory. A number of
      factors have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS, including 
      impaired motility and sensitivity, increased permeability, changes in the gut
      microbiome and alterations in the brain-gut axis. Also food seems to play a
      critical role: the most of IBS patients report the onset or the exacerbation of
      their symptoms after the meals. Recently, an increasing attention has been paid
      to the role of food in IBS. In this review we summarize the most recent evidences
      about the role of diet on IBS symptoms. A diet restricted in fermentable, poorly 
      absorbed carbohydrates and sugar alcohols has beneficial effects on IBS symptoms.
      More studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the relationship between
      food and IBS. However, in the foreseeable future, dietary strategies will
      represent one of the key tools in the therapeutic management of patients with
      IBS.

PG  - 7587-601
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i24.7587 [doi]
AB  - Breath tests are non-invasive tests and can detect H(2) and CH(4) gases which are
      produced by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed intestinal carbohydrate and are 
      excreted in the breath. These tests are used in the diagnosis of carbohydrate
      malabsorption, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and for measuring the
      orocecal transit time. Malabsorption of carbohydrates is a key trigger of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms such as diarrhea and/or
      constipation, bloating, excess flatulence, headaches and lack of energy.
      Abdominal bloating is a common nonspecific symptom which can negatively impact
      quality of life. It may reflect dietary imbalance, such as excess fiber intake,
      or may be a manifestation of IBS. However, bloating may also represent small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients with persistent symptoms of abdominal
      bloating and distension despite dietary interventions should be referred for H(2)
      breath testing to determine the presence or absence of bacterial overgrowth. If
      bacterial overgrowth is identified, patients are typically treated with
      antibiotics. Evaluation of IBS generally includes testing of other disorders that
      cause similar symptoms. Carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose, fructose, sorbitol) 
      can cause abdominal fullness, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and
      diarrhea, which are similar to the symptoms of IBS. However, it is unclear if
      these digestive disorders contribute to or cause the symptoms of IBS. Research
      studies show that a proper diagnosis and effective dietary intervention
      significantly reduces the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in 
      IBS. Thus, diagnosis of malabsorption of these carbohydrates in IBS using a
      breath test is very important to guide the clinician in the proper treatment of
      IBS patients.

      adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive
      disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in 
      UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid
      dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every
      resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease
      activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment,
      infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose
      intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be
      ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization
      of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate
      dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors
      and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when
      indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to
      become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed
      before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when
      all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of
      refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and
      this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in
      this setup.

AB  - Several endocrine cell abnormalities have been reported in different segments of 
      the gastrointestinal tract of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These
      cells have specialized microvilli that project into the lumen; they function as
      sensors for the gut contents and respond to luminal stimuli (mostly ingested
      nutrients) by releasing hormones into the lamina propria, where they exert their 
      effects via a paracrine/endocrine mode of action. Certain food items trigger the 
      symptoms experienced by IBS patients, including those rich in fermentable oligo-,
      di- and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In this review, we present the
      argument that the effects of both FODMAPs and the proportional intake of
      proteins, fats and carbohydrates on IBS symptoms may be caused by an interaction 
      with the gut endocrine cells. Since the gut hormones control and regulate
      gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this interaction may be responsible for 
      abnormal gastrointestinal motility and the visceral hypersensitivity observed in 
      these patients. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from
      food allergy. The role of gluten intolerance in the development of IBS symptoms
      in these patients remains a matter of controversy. Individual guidance on food
      management, which includes restrictions in the intake of FODMAP-rich foods and
      testing diets with different proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates has 
      been found to reduce the symptoms, improve the quality of life, and make the
      habitual diet of IBS patients more healthy.

TI  - An Italian prospective multicenter survey on patients suspected of having
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome
      with several unsettled issues despite the increasing awareness of its existence. 
      We carried out a prospective survey on NCGS in Italian centers for the diagnosis 
      of gluten-related disorders, with the aim of defining the clinical picture of
      this new syndrome and to establish roughly its prevalence compared with celiac
      disease. METHODS: From November 2012 to October 2013, 38 Italian centers (27
      adult gastroenterology, 5 internal medicine, 4 pediatrics, and 2 allergy)
      participated in this prospective survey. A questionnaire was used in order to
      allow uniform and accurate collection of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental 
      data. RESULTS: In total, 486 patients with suspected NCGS were identified in this
      1-year period. The female/male ratio was 5.4 to 1, and the mean age was 38 years 
      (range 3-81). The clinical picture was characterized by combined gastrointestinal
      (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain,
      gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and systemic manifestations
      (tiredness, headache, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      'foggy mind,' dermatitis or skin rash, depression, anxiety, and anemia). In the
      large majority of patients, the time lapse between gluten ingestion and the
      appearance of symptoms varied from a few hours to 1 day. The most frequent
      associated disorders were irritable bowel syndrome (47%), food intolerance (35%) 
      and IgE-mediated allergy (22%). An associated autoimmune disease was detected in 
      14% of cases. Regarding family history, 18% of our patients had a relative with
      celiac disease, but no correlation was found between NCGS and positivity for
      HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 25% of the patients
      tested. Only a proportion of patients underwent duodenal biopsy; for those that
      did, the biopsies showed normal intestinal mucosa (69%) or mild increase in
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (31%). The ratio between suspected NCGS and new CD
      diagnoses, assessed in 28 of the participating centers, was 1.15 to 1.
      CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey shows that NCGS has a strong correlation
      with female gender and adult age. Based on our results, the prevalence of NCGS
      seems to be only slightly higher than that of celiac disease.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by
      intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated 
      to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free
      diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains
      unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS
      have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a 
      response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been 
      postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This
      review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of
      different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper
      screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.

PG  - 51-6
AB  - Chronic diarrhoea is a frequent clinical presentation in our population. It may
      correspond to many gastrointestinal or systemic pathologies. Most frequent causes
      are irritable bowel syndrome, functional intestinal disorders or lactose
      intolerance, but organic diseases have also to be searched. Focused patient
      questioning and some specific aspects of clinical examination play a key-role in 
      diagnosis orientation and the use of complementary explorations. The present
      paper proposes a structured diagnostic procedure aiming at an optimal use of
      complementary explorations.

AB  - About two-thirds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients associate their
      symptoms with certain foods. We reviewed food-related factors putatively
      associated with manifestations of IBS. Soluble fiber may improve constipation but
      frequently increases bloating and abdominal pain. Carbohydrate malabsorption
      seems to be more frequent in IBS. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet significantly reduces IBS
      symptoms and has been suggested as a therapeutic option. Serological screening
      for celiac disease should be done in patients without constipation. Moreover,
      non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity, defined as gluten intolerance once celiac 
      disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out, should be considered in these
      patients. There is no specific diet for IBS patients but small and frequent
      meals, avoiding greasy foods, dairy products, many carbohydrates, caffeine and
      alcohol, is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an algorithm for evaluation of the immune status in IBS
      patients with food intolerance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 42 patients with IBS were 
      observed. The diagnosis is based Rome III criteria. Determination of the
      concentration of serum allergen-IgG-antibodies to food allergens, IgG, IgA, IgM, 
      IgE and immunoregulatory substances IL-5, TGF beta1, IL-10, IL-4 IL-2, IL-13 were
      determined by enzyme immunoassay. All the patients received rotational diet
      therapy based on immunoassay data in addition to medical treatment of the basis
      disease. The control group comprised 15 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Food
      intolerances basically to foods proteinaceous was diagnosed in 25 patients with
      IBS (59.5% of cases). The effectiveness of diet therapy was 68% (17 patients).
      Analysis of clinical and laboratory data revealed that the implementation of food
      intolerance in patients with IBS reducing the levels of IL-10 and TGFbeta1. An
      effective rotational diet of food intolerance in IBS patients had significantly
      (p < 0.05) increase IgA levels. CONCLUSION: Food intolerance in IBS patients
      characterized an increased synthesis of allergen-specific IgG antibodies,
      insufficient production of anti-inflammatory immunoregulatory substances IL-10
      and TGFbeta1, and intact cytokines IL-2, - 4, - 5, - 13, IgG and IgM in serum.
      Efficiency rotary diet in patients with IBS is accompanied by positive clinical
      dynamics, increase levels of anti-inflammatory substances and serum IgA.

TI  - Medically unexplained conditions considered by patients in general practice.
PG  - 156-63
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmt081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients frequently present with multiple and 'unexplained' symptoms,
      often resulting in complex consultations. To better understand these patients is 
      a challenge to health care professionals, in general, and GPs, in particular.
      OBJECTIVES: In our research on symptom reporting, we wanted to explore whether
      patients consider that they may suffer from conditions commonly regarded as
      unexplained, and we explored associations between these concerns and symptom
      load, life stressors and socio-demographic factors. METHODS: Consecutive,
      unselected patients in general practice completed questionnaires addressing eight
      conditions commonly regarded as unexplained (amalgam poisoning, Candida syndrome,
      fibromyalgia, food intolerance, electromagnetic hypersensitivity, burnout
      syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome). With logistic
      regression, we analysed associations with symptom load, burden of life stressors 
      with negative impact on present health and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: 
      Out of the 909 respondents (response rate = 88.8%), 863 had complete data. In
      total, 39.6% of patients had considered that they may suffer from one or more
      unexplained conditions (UCs). These concerns were strongly and positively
      associated with recent symptom load and number of life stressors. If we excluded 
      burnout and food intolerance, corresponding associations were found. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients frequently considered that they may suffer from UCs. The likelihood of
      such concerns strongly increased with an increasing symptom load and with the
      number of life stressors with negative impact on present health. Hence, the
      number of symptoms may be a strong indicator of whether patients consider their
      symptoms part of such often controversial multisymptom conditions.

TI  - Dietary fructose intolerance, fructan intolerance and FODMAPs.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1007/s11894-013-0370-0 [doi]
AB  - Dietary intolerances to fructose, fructans and FODMAPs (fermentable
      oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) are common, yet
      poorly recognized and managed. Over the last decade, they have come to the
      forefront because of new knowledge on the mechanisms and treatment of these
      conditions. Patients with these problems often present with unexplained bloating,
      belching, distension, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Here, we have examined
      the most up-to-date research on these food-related intolerances, discussed
      controversies, and have provided some guidelines for the dietary management of
      these conditions. Breath testing for carbohydrate intolerance appears to be
      standardized and essential for the diagnosis and management of these conditions, 
      especially in the Western population. While current research shows that the
      FODMAP diet may be effective in treating some patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome, additional research is needed to identify more foods items that are
      high in FODMAPs, and to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dietary
      interventions.

AB  - CONTEXT: Fructose is a monosaccharide frequently present in natural and
      artificial juice fruits. When the concentration of fructose in certain food is
      present in excess of glucose concentration some individuals may develop fructose 
      malabsorption. OBJECTIVES: To report the frequency of fructose malabsorption
      utilizing the hydrogen breath test in children with gastrointestinal and/or
      nutritional disorders. METHODS: Between July 2011 and July 2012, 43 patients with
      gastrointestinal and/or nutritional disorders, from both sexes, were
      consecutively studied, utilizing the hydrogen breath test with loads of the
      following carbohydrates: lactose, glucose, fructose and lactulose. Fructose was
      offered in a 10% aqueous solution in the dose of 1 g/kg body weight. Samples were
      collected fasting and at every 15 minutes after the intake of the aqueous
      solution for a 2 hour period. Malabsorption was considered when there was an
      increase of >20 ppm of hydrogen over the fasting level, and intolerance was
      diagnosed if gastrointestinal symptoms would appear. RESULTS: The age of the
      patients varied from 3 months to 16 years, 24 were boys. The following diagnosis 
      were established: irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea in 16, functional
      abdominal pain in 8, short stature in 10, lactose intolerance in 3, celiac
      disease in 1, food allergy in 1 and giardiasis in 1 patient. Fructose
      malabsorption was characterized in 13 (30.2%) patients, and intolerance in 1
      (2.3%) patient. The most frequent fructose malabsorption was characterized in 7
      (16.3%) patients with irritable bowel syndrome and in 4 (9.3%) patients with
      functional abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      and functional abdominal pain were the main cause of fructose malabsorption.

TI  - Lactose intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome patients with diarrhoea: the
      roles of anxiety, activation of the innate mucosal immune system and visceral
      sensitivity.
PG  - 302-11
LID - 10.1111/apt.12582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) often report
      intolerance to milk; however, the mechanism underlying these symptoms is unknown.
      AIM: To assess the role of psychological factors, immune activation and visceral 
      sensitivity on the development of lactose intolerance (LI) in IBS-D patients.
      METHODS: Fifty-five IBS-D patients and 18 healthy controls (HCs) with lactase
      deficiency underwent a 20-g lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT). Patients were
      categorised as lactose malabsorption (LM; malabsorption only) or LI
      [malabsorption plus increase in total symptom score (TSS). Measurements included 
      (i) psychological status; (ii) enteric biopsies with quantification of mast cells
      (MCs), T-lymphocytes and enterochromaffin cells; (iii) serum cytokines; (iv)
      rectal sensitivity before and after lactose ingestion. RESULTS: LI was more
      prevalent in IBS-D patients than HCs [25/55 (46%) vs. 3/18 (17%), P = 0.029].
      IBS-D patients with LI had (i) higher levels of anxiety than those with LM (P =
      0.017) or HCs (P = 0.006); (ii) increased mucosal MCs compared with LM (P =
      0.006) and HCs (P < 0.001); (iii) raised serum TNF-alpha compared with LM (P =
      0.034) and HCs (P < 0.001) and (iv) increased rectal sensitivity after lactose
      ingestion compared with LM (P < 0.001) or HCs (P < 0.001). Severity of abdominal 
      symptoms after lactose ingestion was associated with the increase in visceral
      sensitivity after lactose intake (r = 0.629, P < 0.001), MCs (r = 0.650, P <
      0.001) and anxiety (r = 0.519, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D patients with
      lactose intolerence are characterised by anxiety, mucosal immune activation and
      increased visceral sensitivity after lactose ingestion. The presence of these
      biomarkers may indicate an IBS phenotype that responds to dietary therapy and/or 
      mast cell stabilisers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse food reactions (AFR) have has recently attracted increased
      attention from the media and are now more commonly reported by patients. Its
      classification, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment are complex and present a
      considerable challenge in clinical practice. Non-immune-mediated types of food
      intolerance have a cumulative prevalence of 30% to 40%, while true
      (immune-mediated) food allergies affect only 2% to 5% of the German population.
      METHOD: We selectively searched the literature for pertinent publications on
      carbohydrate malabsorption, with special attention to published guidelines and
      position papers. RESULTS: Carbohydrate intolerance can be the result of a rare,
      systemic metabolic defect (e.g., fructose intolerance, with a prevalence of 1 in 
      25,000 persons) or of gastrointestinal carbohydrate malabsorption. The
      malabsorption of simple carbohydrates is the most common type of
      non-immune-mediated food intolerance, affecting 20% to 30% of the European
      population. This condition is caused either by deficient digestion of lactose or 
      by malabsorption of fructose and/or sorbitol. Half of all cases of
      gastrointestinal carbohydrate intolerance have nonspecific manifestations, with a
      differential diagnosis including irritable bowel syndrome, intolerance reactions,
      chronic infections, bacterial overgrowth, drug side effects, and other diseases. 
      The diagnostic evaluation includes a nutritional history, an H2 breath test,
      ultrasonography, endoscopy, and stool culture. CONCLUSION: The goals of treatment
      for carbohydrate malabsorption are to eliminate the intake of the responsible
      carbohydrate substance or reduce it to a tolerable amount and to assure the
      physiological nutritional composition of the patient's diet. In parallel with
      these goals, the patient should receive extensive information about the
      condition, and any underlying disease should be adequately treated.

AB  - Histamine is a biogenic amine with extensive effects on many cell types, mediated
      by the activation of its four receptors (H1R-H4R). Distinct effects are dependent
      on receptor subtypes and their differential expression. Within the
      gastrointestinal tract, histamine is present at relatively high concentrations,
      particularly during inflammatory responses. In this review, we discuss the
      immunoregulatory influence of histamine on a number of gastrointestinal
      disorders, including food allergy, scombroid food poisoning, histamine
      intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is
      clear that the effects of histamine on mucosal immune homeostasis are dependent
      on expression and activity of the four currently known histamine receptors;
      however, the relative protective or pathogenic effects of histamine on
      inflammatory processes within the gut are still poorly defined and require
      further investigation.

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i38.6465 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the association between consumption of spicy foods and prevalence
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, data from 4763 Iranian adult participants were used.
      Consumption of spicy foods was estimated using a dietary habits questionnaire
      that included a question on spicy foods consumption: "how frequently do you use
      spicy foods (pepper, curry, ginger, cinnamon and turmeric) during a week?"
      Participants could respond to the question by choosing one of these choices:
      never, 1-3 times, 4-6 times, 7-9 times, or more than 10 times per week. A
      modified Persian version of the Rome III questionnaire was used to determine the 
      prevalence of IBS. RESULTS: IBS was prevalent in 21.7% (18.6% of men and 24.1% of
      women) of the study population. After controlling for potential confounders
      including dietary behaviors, those consuming spicy foods >/= 10 times per week
      were 92% more likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy
      foods (OR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.23-3.01, P trend < 0.01). The association remained
      significant even after taking lactose intolerance into account (OR = 1.85; 95%CI:
      1.18-2.90, P trend < 0.01). Stratified analysis by gender revealed that the
      association between consumption of spicy foods and IBS was not significant in
      men; however, a significant association was found among women after taking
      potential cofounders, including meal regularity and lactose intolerance, into
      account. Women who consumed spicy foods >/= 10 times per week were two times more
      likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy foods (OR = 2.03;
      95%CI: 1.09-3.77, P trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Consumption of spicy foods is
      directly associated with IBS, particularly in women. Further, prospective studies
      are warranted to (1) examine this association in other populations; and (2)
      evaluate whether dietary interventions, for example a reduction in spice
      consumption, would improve IBS symptoms.

TI  - A diet low in FODMAPs reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 67-75.e5

LID - S0016-5085(13)01407-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) often is used to manage functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet
      there is limited evidence of its efficacy, compared with a normal Western diet.
      We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian 
      diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients
      with IBS. METHODS: In a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals
      (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from
      subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups 
      that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian
      diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to
      the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual
      analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet
      periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the
      low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for
      frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating. RESULTS:
      Subjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95%
      confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with 
      the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and
      the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were
      reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and
      unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater
      satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but
      diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and
      King's Stool Chart scores. CONCLUSIONS: In a controlled, cross-over study of
      patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a
      first-line therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: ACTRN12612001185853.

PG  - 1034-9
LID - 10.1111/jdv.12251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pruritus is an important distressing condition that is often 
      refractory to treatment. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional
      gastrointestinal disorder that occurs without an organic cause. OBJECTIVES: We
      aimed to investigate the relationship between chronic pruritus of undetermined
      origin (CPUO) and IBS. METHODS: Eighty patients with chronic pruritus (CP) of
      undetermined origin and fifty healthy control subjects without pruritus were
      included into the study. All of the participants were examined by a
      gastroenterologist for concomitant IBS. RESULTS: The frequency of IBS was found
      higher in patients with CP of undetermined origin (P: 0.02), but we did not
      observe any significant association between pruritus intensity and either
      presence of IBS (P: 0.08) or the subtypes of the syndrome (P: 0.40). Furthermore,
      patients with CP of undetermined origin between 40 and 60 years, female gender
      and longer duration of the disease were found to be significantly associated with
      the presence of IBS (P: 0.02, P: 0.01 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 
      the frequency of IBS was higher in patients with CP than in healthy controls. Our
      study is the first report about the relation between CP of undetermined origin
      and IBS. Further studies with larger numbers of the patients are needed to show
      association between IBS and CPUO using laboratory tests to define underlying
      diseases such as lactose intolerance, functional dyspepsia and emotional
      diseases.

AB  - For many years irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and celiac disease (CD) have been
      considered 2 completely separate entities, with CD being clearly related to a
      permanent gluten intolerance and IBS having no relation with gluten ingestion.
      However IBS and CD symptoms may be indistinguishable, especially when diarrhea,
      bloating or abdominal pain predominate. In the last decade several studies have
      shown that the separation between CD and IBS is not so clear. Thus, some patients
      who have been diagnosed of IBS suffer in fact from CD. In addition, it seems that
      there is a group of patients who, without having CD, suffer gluten intolerance
      that cause them digestive symptoms similar to those of IBS. Gluten sensitivity is
      defined as the spectrum of morphological, immunological and functional
      abnormalities that respond to a gluten-free diet. This concept includes
      histological, immunological and clinical manifestations in the absence of evident
      morphological abnormalities. Therefore, it is mandatory to establish in a
      scientific way in which patients a gluten-free diet will be beneficial as well as
      when this is not justified.

TI  - Bloating and distention in irritable bowel syndrome: the role of gas production
      and visceral sensation after lactose ingestion in a population with lactase
      deficiency.
PG  - 1516-25
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bloating and distention are often attributed to dietary factors by
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study examined the effects of 
      gas production and visceral hypersensitivity on digestive symptoms after lactose 
      ingestion in a population with lactase deficiency. METHODS: IBS patients (n=277) 
      and healthy controls (HCs, n=64) underwent a 20-g lactose hydrogen breath test
      (LHBT) with evaluation of hydrogen gas production and lactose intolerance (LI)
      symptoms. Abdominal distention (199 IBS, 40 HCs) was measured during LHBT. Rectal
      sensitivity (74 IBS, 64 HCs) was assessed by barostat studies. RESULTS: Hydrogen 
      production and distention were similar in IBS patients and HCs during LHBT;
      however, LI was more frequent in IBS (53.8 vs. 28.1%, P<0.001), especially
      bloating (39.0% vs. 14.1%, P<0.001) and borborygmi (39.0 vs. 21.9%, P=0.010).
      Only 59.0% of patients with bloating had distention. No correlation was observed 
      between girth increment and bloating (P=0.585). IBS patients had lower rectal
      sensory thresholds (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that hydrogen
      production increased bloating (odds ratio (OR) 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI)
      1.09-4.39, P=0.028) and borborygmi (OR 12.37, 95% CI 3.34-45.83, P<0.001) but not
      distention (P=0.673). Visceral hypersensitivity was associated with bloating (OR 
      6.61, 95% CI 1.75-25.00, P=0.005) and total symptom score (OR 3.78, 95% CI
      1.30-10.99, P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Gas production and visceral hypersensitivity
      both contribute to digestive symptoms, especially bloating and borborygmi, in IBS
      patients after lactose ingestion. Objective abdominal distention is not
      correlated with subjective bloating.

TI  - The relationship of food intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome in adults.
PG  - 275-82
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e31829ed911 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this literature review is to develop a thorough understanding of
      the research on food intolerance and its relationship to irritable bowel
      syndrome. Knowledge of the connection between the two conditions will assist
      allied healthcare professionals in working with patients to better manage their
      symptoms. Reduced healthcare costs may also result if patients are able to
      identify problematic foods and experience symptom improvement with diet changes. 
      The review consists of an overview of food intolerance including prevalence,
      specific foods implicated including an in-depth review of research on bulk
      sweeteners, as well as methods of diagnosis. In addition, prevalence, specific
      foods associated with food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome patients such 
      as carbohydrates and lipids, nutritional consequences of food intolerance, and
      possible food-related methods of treatment including increased fiber intake are
      discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research and possible directions
      allied healthcare professionals can start with in assisting patients are
      provided.

PG  - 402-12
LID - 10.5604/17322693.1049285 [doi]
AB  - Beneficial effects due to the presence of probiotic bacteria of the genus
      Bifidobacterium in the human intestinal tract are still an interesting object of 
      study. So far activities have been confirmed of bifidobacteria in stimulation of 
      the host immune system, stimulation of tumor cell apoptosis, improvement of bowel
      motility, alleviation of symptoms of lactose intolerance, cholesterol lowering
      capacity, prevention and treatment of diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome,
      alleviation of allergy or atopic dermatitis, maintenance of homeostasis of the
      intestine, and stimulation of the development of normal intestinal microflora in 
      infants. A multitude of therapeutic properties encourages researchers to
      investigate the possibility of using the potential of Bifidobacterium in the
      prevention and treatment of other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and
      depression. Although it is known that the beneficial effects are due to
      intestinal mucosal colonization by these bacteria, the cell components
      responsible for the colonization are still not determined. In addition to the
      beneficial effects of probiotic administration, there were also negative effects 
      including sepsis. Therefore research has been directed to identify specific
      components of Bifidobacterium responsible for probiotic effects. Currently
      researchers are focused on identifying, isolating and evaluating the properties
      of surface proteins that are probably involved in the adhesion of bacterial cells
      to the intestinal epithelium, improving colonization. This paper is an overview
      of current knowledge on Bifidobacterium surface proteins. The ways of transport
      and anchoring proteins in Gram-positive bacterial cells, the assembly of cell
      wall, and a description of the genus Bifidobacterium are presented.

TI  - Pediatric and adult celiac disease: similarities and differences.
PG  - 283-8
LID - 10.1007/s12664-013-0339-9 [doi]
AB  - Differences between children and adults in celiac disease (CD) presentation and
      epidemiology are reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, histological changes,
      serology, and response to gluten-free diet are similar. Differences exist in
      epidemiology, type of clinical presentations, coexisting diseases, complications,
      and association with obesity. CD is two to five times more common in children
      than in adults. Classical CD with gastrointestinal symptoms is more common in
      children whereas nonclassical CD dominates in adults. A gene dose phenomenon
      (double-dose HLA-DQB1 02 allele) is postulated to be responsible for this
      difference. Coexisting autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1,
      Sjogren's syndrome, and dermatitis herpetiformis are more common in adults than
      in children (42 % vs. 5 %). The association of overweight/obesity and CD is
      stronger in adults than in children (22.5 % vs. 14 %). Besides poor compliance,
      pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, irritable
      bowel syndrome, lymphocytic colitis, and microscopic colitis are considered
      responsible for nonresponsive CD in adults but not in children. Complications
      like refractory sprue and small intestinal neoplasms are seen exclusively in
      adults. Existing diagnostic criteria (modified ESPGHAN) are not suitable for
      diagnosing CD in adults as the majority of cases are either nonclassical or
      subclinical CD.

TI  - Lactose malabsorption diagnosed by 50-g dose is inferior to assess clinical
      intolerance and to predict response to milk withdrawal than 25-g dose in an
      endemic area.
PG  - 1462-8
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12273 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), diagnosed currently using lactose
      hydrogen breath and tolerance tests (LHBT, LTT) with a high, nonphysiological
      dose (50-g), may mimic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In LM-endemic areas,
      clinically significant malabsorption (lactose intolerance) may be better
      diagnosed using a lesser dose, and positive results so obtained may predict
      response to milk withdrawal more effectively. METHODS: Fifty patients each with
      IBS (Rome III) were evaluated using LHBT and LTT with 50-g, 25-g, and 12-g
      lactose. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT and LTT with different dosages (gold
      standard: lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism) and symptom development were
      evaluated. Effect of milk withdrawal was studied. RESULT: Of 150 patients, 37/50 
      (74%) and 28/50 (56%) had LM by LHBT and LTT using 50-g lactose; 41/50 (82%) and 
      31/50 (62%) had LM using 25-g lactose, and 14/50 (28%) and 29/50 (58%) using 12-g
      lactose, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT using 50-g, 25-g, and 
      12-g lactose were 92.6%, 52.0%, and 94%, 60%, and 36.4%, 88.2%, and those of LTT,
      92%, 80.0%, and 84.8%, 82.4%, and 66.7%, 58.8%, respectively. Breath hydrogen
      correlated with lactose dose. Though patients developing symptoms with 50-g
      lactose exhaled more hydrogen than those remaining asymptomatic, hydrogen levels 
      did not differ following 25-g and 12-g dosages in relation to symptom
      development. Patients' milk intake was 335 +/- 92 mL/d ( approximately 16.7 +/-
      9.6-g lactose). Positive LHBT using 25-g dose better predicted symptom resolution
      than by 50-g and 12-g lactose. CONCLUSION: Twenty-five gram is the ideal dose of 
      lactose for LHBT and LTT in LM-endemic areas.

TI  - The low FODMAP diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome: a prospective study.
PG  - 895-903
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Current treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is
      suboptimal. Fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may
      trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients. Our aim was to determine
      whether a low FODMAP diet improves symptoms in IBS patients. METHODS: Irritable
      bowel syndrome patients, who had performed hydrogen/methane breath testing for
      fructose and lactose malabsorption and had received dietary advice regarding the 
      low FODMAP diet, were included. The effect of low FODMAP diet was prospectively
      evaluated using a symptom questionnaire. Furthermore, questions about adherence
      and satisfaction with symptom improvement, dietary advice and diet were assessed.
      RESULTS: Ninety patients with a mean follow up of 15.7 months were studied. Most 
      symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea
      significantly improved (p < 0.001 for all). 75.6%, 37.8% and 13.3% of patients
      had fructose, lactose malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      respectively. Fructose malabsorption was significantly associated with symptom
      improvement (abdominal pain odds ratio (OR) 7.09 [95% confidence interval (CI)
      2.01-25.0], bloating OR 8.71 (95% CI 2.76-27.5), flatulence OR 7.64 (95% CI
      2.53-23.0) and diarrhoea OR 3.39 (95% CI 1.17-9.78), p < 0.029 for all). Most
      patients (75.6%) were adherent to the diet, which was associated with symptom
      improvement (abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea all significantly
      associated with adherence, r > 0.27, p < 0.011). Most patients (72.1%) were
      satisfied with their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The low FODMAP diet shows efficacy
      for IBS patients. The current strategy of breath testing and dietary advice
      provides a good basis to understand and adhere to the diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food is one of the most commonly reported triggers of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms. However, the role of diet in the aetiology and
      management of IBS has not been clearly established. The present study aimed to
      examine the dietary practices of Irish patients with IBS and to determine whether
      these practices increased their vulnerability to nutritional inadequacies.
      METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 135 IBS patients on their perceptions
      of the role of diet in their symptoms and whether they restrict their diet
      according to the symptoms experienced. A similar questionnaire was used to
      investigate the perceptions of 111 healthy subjects to the gastrointestinal
      symptoms experienced on the consumption of food. RESULTS: Food was considered to 
      cause or worsen their gastrointestinal symptoms in 89.6% of IBS patients compared
      to 55% of healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Cereal-based foods, predominantly bread
      or its components, were the most frequently cited (53.3%), and spicy foods
      (39.3%), vegetables and fatty foods (35.6% for both) also featured prominently. A
      significantly greater number of patients with IBS reported changing their diet to
      minimise symptoms compared to healthy controls (91.9% versus 45.5%, P < 0.001).
      In relation to whole food groups, milk products (9.6%), fruit (7.4%) and
      vegetables (5.2%) were those most commonly restricted, with only a small number
      of IBS patients seeking professional healthcare advice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority
      of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to food, and change their
      diet by limiting the foods that they perceive as problematic, with some
      restricting whole food groups. Few patients sought professional healthcare advice
      when implementing dietary change, possibly exposing a considerable number to an
      increased risk of nutritional deficiency.

TI  - [The role of small bowel microflora in the development of secondary lactase
      deficiency and the possibilities of its treatment with probiotics].
PG  - 21-6
AB  - AIM: To estimate the incidence of secondary lactase deficiency (SLD) in patients 
      with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PIBS) and the value of the small
      bowel microflora in its development and to elaborate treatment options for SLD.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with PIBS, including 
      112 (81.2%) women and 26 (18.8%) men, were examined. The patients' mean age was
      33.9 +/- 9.1 years. The duration of the disease was 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. Lactase
      deficiency (LD) was diagnosed using the color scale to test biopsy specimens from
      the duodenal retrobulbar region. The bacterial overgrowth syndrome (BOS) was
      identified by a 2-hour lactulose (20 ml) hydrogen breath test. Sixty patients
      with moderate SLD were randomized to 2 groups: 1) 41 patients received basic
      therapy (mesim forte as one tablet t.i.d., no-spa, 40 mg, t.i.d.) and combined
      probiotic bifiform (Ferrosan) containing Bifidobacterium longum 107, Enterococcus
      faecium 107 as one capsule t.i.d. for 14 days. Group 2 patients (n = 19) had
      basic therapy in combination with placebo. RESULTS: SLD was detected in 59.4% of 
      the patients with PIBS, including 43.5 and 15.9% with moderate and severe forms, 
      respectively. In all cases, SLD was accompanied by BOS in the small bowel lumen, 
      as confirmed by the results of a hydrogen breath test [101 +/- 37 ppm (a normal
      value of < 20 ppm)]. After a 14-day course of therapy with the combined probiotic
      bifiform, restoration of eubiosis in the small bowel lumen was achieved in 70.8% 
      of the patients, as shown by the lesser degree of BOS (86.9 +/- 40.9 and 17.4 +/-
      6.6 ppm before and after treatment, respectively; p < 0.01) and by normalization 
      of the lactase test (p < 0.01). In the comparative placebo group, 68.4% showed no
      clear positive changes, SLD and BOS remained. CONCLUSION: The changes in the
      small bowel intraluminal microflora, which developed after prior intestinal
      infection, played a great role in the development of SLD. Bifiform belongs to the
      currently available probiotics and may be recommended to correct SLD in patients 
      with PIBS resulting from the impaired microbiota of the small bowel and to
      prevent BOS.

TI  - Self-reported food-related gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS are common and
      associated with more severe symptoms and reduced quality of life.
PG  - 634-41
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.105 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that food and diet are central issues, that concern 
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the current understanding about the
      association between the intake of certain foods/food groups and the
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptom pattern, psychological symptoms, and quality of
      life is poor. The aim of this study was to determine which food groups and
      specific food items IBS patients report causing GI symptoms, and to investigate
      the association with GI and psychological symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: 
      We included 197 IBS patients (mean age 35 (18-72) years; 142 female subjects) who
      completed a food questionnaire in which they specified symptoms from 56 different
      food items or food groups relevant to food intolerance/allergy. The patients also
      completed questionnaires to assess depression and general anxiety (Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression), GI-specific anxiety (Visceral Sensitivity Index), IBS
      symptoms (IBS-Severity Scoring System), somatic symptoms (Patient Health
      Questionnaire-15), and quality of life (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire). RESULTS: In all, 84% of the studied population reported symptoms 
      related to at least one of the food items surveyed. Symptoms related to intake of
      food items with incompletely absorbed carbohydrates were noted in 138 (70%)
      patients; the most common were dairy products (49%), beans/lentils (36%), apple
      (28%), flour (24%), and plum (23%). Of these, 58% experienced GI symptoms from
      foods rich in biogenic amines, such as wine/beer (31%), salami (22%), and cheese 
      (20%). Histamine-releasing foods, such as milk (43%), wine/beer (31%), and pork
      (21%), were also considered causes of symptoms in IBS patients. GI symptoms were 
      also frequently reported after intake of fried and fatty foods (52%). With
      increasing IBS symptom severity, patients reported more food items responsible
      for their GI symptoms (P=0.004), and this was also found in patients with more
      severe somatic symptoms (P<0.0001). Women tended to report more food items
      causing symptoms than men (P=0.06). A high number of food items causing GI
      symptoms was also associated with reduced quality of life and this was
      significant for the following domains: sleep (r=-0.25; P=0.001), energy (r=-0.21;
      P=0.005), food (r=-0.29; P<0.001), social functioning (r=-0.23; P=0.001), and
      physical status (r=-0.16; P<0.05). However, the number of food items reported to 
      provoke GI symptoms was unrelated to body mass index, age, IBS subtype, anxiety, 
      depression, or GI-specific anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IBS patients
      believe that certain food items are important triggers of their GI symptoms. This
      is especially true for foods containing carbohydrates and fat, and also may be
      relevant for histamine-releasing food items and foods rich in biogenic amines.
      Self-reported food intolerance is associated with high symptom burden and reduced
      quality of life.

TI  - Fructose and lactose intolerance and malabsorption testing: the relationship with
      symptoms in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 1074-83
LID - 10.1111/apt.12306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of fructose and lactose intolerance and malabsorption
      with the symptoms of different functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID)
      remains unclear. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of fructose and lactose
      intolerance (symptom induction) and malabsorption and their association with
      clinical gastrointestinal (GI) as well as non-GI symptoms in FGID and the outcome
      of dietary intervention. METHODS: Fructose and lactose intolerance (defined by
      positive symptom index) and malabsorption (defined by increased hydrogen/methane)
      were determined in 1372 FGID patients in a single centre using breath testing.
      Results were correlated with clinical symptoms in different FGID Rome III
      subgroups. The effectiveness of a targeted saccharide-reduced diet was assessed
      after 6-8 weeks. RESULTS: Intolerance prevalence across all FGIDs was 60% to
      fructose, 51% to lactose and 33% to both. Malabsorption occurred in 45%, 32% and 
      16% respectively. There were no differences in intolerance or malabsorption
      prevalence between FGID subgroups. FGID symptoms correlated with symptoms evoked 
      during testing (r = 0.35-0.61. P < 0.0001), but not with malabsorption. Non-GI
      symptoms occurred more commonly in patients with intolerances. Methane breath
      levels were not associated with constipation using several cut-off thresholds.
      Adequate symptom relief was achieved in >80% of intolerant patients, irrespective
      of malabsorption. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose and lactose intolerances are common in
      FGID and associated with increased non-GI symptoms, but not with specific FGID
      subtypes. Symptoms experienced during breath testing, but not malabsorption,
      correlate with FGID symptoms. Effective symptom relief with dietary adaptation is
      not associated with malabsorption. Mechanisms relating to the generation of GI
      and non-GI symptoms due to lactose and fructose in FGID need to be explored
      further.

TI  - Dietary proteins and functional gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 728-36
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.97 [doi]
AB  - Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional
      gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease.
      Although there has been a longstanding interest in the possible role of food
      allergy in IBS, there are limited data supporting the association. However, the
      prevalence of food allergy is sufficiently high that patients with FGID may also 
      have food allergies or hypersensitivities. Food intolerances or sensitivities are
      reactions to foods, which are not due to immunological mechanisms. Lactose
      intolerance is common in the general population and can mimic symptoms of FGID or
      coexist with FGID. As discussed in other articles in this series, other
      carbohydrate intolerances may be responsible for symptom generation in patients
      with IBS and perhaps other FGIDs. There is a great interest in the role of a
      major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms that are very
      similar to those of patients with celiac disease without the enteropathy that
      characterizes celiac disease. Emerging research into a syndrome known as
      nonceliac gluten sensitivity suggests a heterogeneous condition with some
      features of celiac disease but often categorized as FGIDs, including IBS. This
      article summarizes the role of dietary proteins in the symptoms and
      pathophysiology of FGIDs.

TI  - The importance of methane breath testing: a review.
PG  - 024001
LID - 10.1088/1752-7155/7/2/024001 [doi]
AB  - Sugar malabsorption in the bowel can lead to bloating, cramps, diarrhea and other
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome as well as affecting absorption of other
      nutrients. The hydrogen breath test is now a well established noninvasive test
      for assessing malabsorption of sugars in the small intestine. However, there are 
      patients who can suffer from the same spectrum of malabsorption issues but who
      produce little or no hydrogen, instead producing relatively large amounts of
      methane. These patients will avoid detection with the traditional breath test for
      malabsorption based on hydrogen detection. Likewise the hydrogen breath test is
      an established method for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) diagnoses.
      Therefore, a number of false negatives would be expected for patients who solely 
      produce methane. Usually patients produce either hydrogen or methane, and only
      rarely there are significant co-producers, as typically the methane is produced
      at the expense of hydrogen by microbial conversion of carbon dioxide. Various
      studies show that methanogens occur in about a third of all adult humans;
      therefore, there is significant potential for malabsorbers to remain undiagnosed 
      if a simple hydrogen breath test is used. As an example, the hydrogen-based
      lactose malabsorption test is considered to result in about 5-15% false negatives
      mainly due to methane production. Until recently methane measurements were more
      in the domain of research laboratories, unlike hydrogen analyses which can now be
      undertaken at a relatively low cost mainly due to the invention of reliable
      electrochemical hydrogen sensors. More recently, simpler lower cost
      instrumentation has become commercially available which can directly measure both
      hydrogen and methane simultaneously on human breath. This makes more widespread
      clinical testing a realistic possibility. The production of small amounts of
      hydrogen and/or methane does not normally produce symptoms, whereas the
      production of higher levels can lead to a wide range of symptoms ranging from
      functional disorders of the bowel to low level depression. It is possible that
      excess methane levels may have more health consequences than excess hydrogen
      levels. This review describes the health consequences of methane production in
      humans and animals including a summary of the state of the art in detection
      methods. In conclusion, the combined measurement of hydrogen and methane should
      offer considerable improvement in the diagnosis of malabsorption syndromes and
      SIBO when compared with a single hydrogen breath test.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of lactase deficiency on digestive symptoms and
      diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not been well defined. 
      We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in 
      healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS).
      METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital,
      Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect
      malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in
      random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the
      dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose
      intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of
      controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS 
      were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 
      1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; 
      P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients
      with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 
      95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However,
      self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests.
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and
      intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported 
      LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with
      avoidance of dairy products.
