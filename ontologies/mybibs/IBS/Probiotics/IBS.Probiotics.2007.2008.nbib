AB  - Functional gastrointestinal (GI) and motility disorders generate a large volume
      of consultations in gastroenterology and primary care offices. The present
      article summarizes the most interesting studies presented in the annual meeting
      of the American Gastroenterological Association 2008. For all functional GI
      disorders, studies were presented that evaluated the applicability of diagnostic 
      criteria in clinical practice and new data were presented on physiopathology (for
      example, mediation by neuromodulators such as serotonin, microinflammation,
      alterations in intestinal microbiota, and psychological factors). More
      specifically, the therapeutic results of new prokinetic agents in functional
      dyspepsia, such as acotiamide, were presented. This agent has been demonstrated
      to have good efficacy in symptom control, especially in patients with
      postprandial distress syndrome. In irritable bowel syndrome, data were presented 
      on several drugs that act through diverse mechanisms of action and have been
      shown to be more effective than placebo in symptom control. These drugs include
      antiinflammatory agents such as mesalazine, antibiotics such as rifaximin,
      probiotics with distinct bacterial strains, and prokinetic agents such as
      lubiprostone. Highly promising results have been obtained in the treatment of
      constipation with prokinetics such as prucalopride and with novel laxatives such 
      as linaclotide, as well as with techniques that continue to be shown to be
      effective such as anorectal biofeedback, which is also highly useful in patients 
      with fecal incontinence. Another disorder that is less frequent but highly
      difficult to treat is gastroparesis. For several years, treatment in the most
      severe cases has consisted of implantation of a gastric pacemaker. Although the
      results are far from perfect, new data were presented that allow better patient
      selection to achieve greater symptom control. The list of new advances, both in
      knowledge of the physiopathology of these disorders and on their treatments, is
      extensive. Consequently, 2008 has been a good year in terms of the useful
      information gathered for physicians interested in functional GI and motor
      disorders.

TI  - The efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 325-32

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic
      review was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May
      2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases
      were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW
      (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra
      information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing
      probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any
      acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in
      abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and
      data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were
      synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous
      data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random
      effects models. RESULTS: 19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were
      identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate
      methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There
      were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable.
      Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not
      improving=0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT)=4 (95%
      CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=28.3, p=0.001,
      I(2)=68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351
      patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD=-0.34;
      95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity
      (chi(2)=67.04, p<0.001, I(2)=79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial. 
      CONCLUSION: Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of
      benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a trans-galactooligosaccharide prebiotic on faecal
      microbiota and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 508-18

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy 
      of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic
      microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44
      patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel
      crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either
      3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored 
      weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal
      microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global
      assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
      RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 
      0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters
      monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency
      (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score
      of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly
      improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut
      bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These
      findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.

AB  - Probiotics are microorganisms with potential health benefits. They may be used to
      prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea.
      They may also be effective in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and
      in treating atopic dermatitis in children. Species commonly used include
      Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Streptococcus thermophilus, and
      Saccharomyces boulardii. Typical dosages vary based on the product, but common
      dosages range from 5 to 10 billion colony-forming units per day for children, and
      from 10 to 20 billion colony-forming units per day for adults. Significant
      adverse effects are rare, and there are no known interactions with medications.

AB  - The gut contains a diverse bacterial flora that is acquired at birth and has a
      number of physiological functions. Administration of prebiotics or probiotics may
      favourably alter this gut microflora. Prebiotics are poorly digested
      oligosaccharides that promote the growth of desirable bacteria and may have other
      beneficial gastrointestinal and systemic effects. Probiotics are "helpful" human 
      bacteria that provide a variety of health benefits when administered exogenously.
      Probiotics produce beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of
      traveller's diarrhoea, viral diarrhoea, and diarrhoea in day care centres.
      Moreover, probiotics have been shown to reduce relapses associated with
      Clostridium difficile, and Lactobacilli are effective in the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Probiotics may also be efficacious in the
      treatment of gastroenteritis. Clinical studies of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease have proved disappointing, but beneficial effects in adults with
      irritable bowel syndrome have been reported with Bifidobacterium infantis 35624. 
      Lactobacilli GG reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and gut
      permeability in patients with atopic dermatitis, and administration of probiotics
      reduces the frequency and severity of atopic eczema when administered to pregnant
      women and then to newborn infants. In conclusion, probiotics are effective in the
      treatment and/or prevention of a number of conditions, including diarrhoea,
      irritable bowel syndrome and atopic dermatitis, and the product used should be
      selected based on the particular indication.

      (IBS). Furthermore, human pharmacodynamic studies utilizing transit, colonic, or 
      rectal sensitivity and brain imaging have been useful in determining therapeutic 
      efficacy (particularly for drugs that act on motor function). This review
      provides an overview of medications that have not yet been approved for treatment
      of patients with IBS yet have shown promise in phase IIB trials. These include
      drugs that act on the serotonin receptor and transporter system: antidepressants,
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, opioids, cholecystokinin antagonists,
      neurokinin-antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase C
      agonists, atypical benzodiazepines, probiotics, and antibiotics. The changing
      landscape in the regulatory approval process has impacted the development of IBS 
      drugs. Guidance documents from regulatory agencies in Europe and the United
      States have focused on patients' reported outcomes and associated quality of
      life. After a decade of experience with different end points that have generated 
      some data on psychometric validation and unprecedented information about
      responsiveness of the binary or global end points to drug therapy, it is
      necessary to pursue further validation studies before or during pivotal phase IIB
      or III trials. The hope of providing relief to patients should galvanize all
      parties to achieve these goals.

AB  - To review the rationale and current evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in
      the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the following specific questions
      are addressed from a review of the published literature: Are bacterial flora
      altered in IBS? Is infection a significant risk factor for IBS? How prominent is 
      the inflammation in IBS? Do probiotics change bacterial flora? Do probiotics
      adhere to mucosa? What are the potential mechanisms of action of probiotics in
      IBS: immune function, motor, secretory, sensory, and fermentation? What is the
      efficacy of probiotics in IBS?

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on abdominal distension and gastrointestinal
      transit in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03853.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in
      girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed
      transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with
      acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with 
      constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control
      product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms
      were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS:
      Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant
      reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference -
      39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension
      during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal 
      [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P =
      0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P =
      0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in
      objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as
      reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit 
      is a useful strategy for treating distension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To
      investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms
      of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS.
      METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria,
      participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising
      two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB
      30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum
      CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8
      weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly
      during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A
      significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in
      scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was 
      observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the
      probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain
      probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.

PG  - 704-8
LID - 10.1016/j.coph.2008.08.007 [doi]
AB  - While a rationale for the use of probiotics can be developed for a number of
      functional gastrointestinal symptoms and syndromes and an experimental basis for 
      their use continues to emerge, the only functional disorder for which an adequate
      database of clinical trials of probiotics to permit an assessment of clinical
      efficacy exists is the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS has also attracted
      attention, in this regard, because of recent revelations with regard to the
      potential roles of the enteric flora and immune activation in the pathogenesis of
      IBS, thereby, leading to a re-awakening of interest in bacteriotherapy in this
      common and challenging disorder. Some recent randomized controlled studies attest
      to the efficacy of some probiotics in alleviating individual IBS symptoms while
      selected strains have a more global impact. Evidence for long-term efficacy is
      also beginning to emerge though more studies are needed in this regard. Several
      other issues complicate the interpretation of much of the literature in this
      area: lack of quality control, use of many different species, and, strains and,
      above all, significant deficiencies in trial methodology.

TI  - Probiotic effects on intestinal fermentation patterns in patients with irritable 
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 5020-4
AB  - AIM: To determine whether Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (Yakult) can alter
      small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), as tested by the lactulose breath
      test, and whether this is associated with changes in symptoms in irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). METHODS: 18 patients with IBS (Rome II criteria), who showed an
      early rise in breath hydrogen with lactulose (ERBHAL), consumed 65 mL of Yakult
      daily for 6 wk. Lactulose breath test was repeated at the end of the treatment
      period. Symptoms were recorded daily using a 10 cm visual analogue scale.
      RESULTS: 14 patients completed the study, 9 (64%) had reversal of ERBHAL, with
      the median time of first rise in breath hydrogen increasing from 45 to 75 min (P 
      = 0.03). There was no significant improvement in the symptom score with probiotic
      therapy, except for wind (P = 0.04). Patients commencing with at least moderate
      symptoms and who no longer had ERBHAL at the end of treatment, showed improvement
      in the overall symptoms scores [median final score 5.3 (IQR 3.9-5.9), 55%
      reduction; n = 6] to a greater extent than those who had had persisting ERBHAL
      [final score 6.9 (5.0-7.0), 12% reduction; n = 5; P = 0.18]. CONCLUSION: Yakult
      is effective in altering fermentation patterns in the small bowel, consistent
      with reducing SIBO. The loss of ERBHAL was associated with reduced symptoms. The 
      true interpretation of these findings awaits a randomised, controlled trial.

TI  - Pharmacologic treatment of constipation: what is new?
PG  - 724-8
LID - 10.1016/j.coph.2008.07.008 [doi]
AB  - Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disease affecting 2-27% of the
      population in Western hemisphere. Approximately in half of patients the diagnosis
      of functional constipation is made after having ruled out secondary causes.
      Treatment of chronic functional constipation primarily addresses education on
      toilet habits, dietary advice, and patient reassurance. Further therapies are
      guided according to functional subtype slow-transit constipation, dyssynergic
      defecation, and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C).
      Traditionally, the pharmacologic treatment of constipation uses primarily bulking
      agents and/or laxatives (osmotic or secretory). However, often these therapies do
      not provide the desired improvement, have a short-lived efficacy and/or are
      accompanied by side-effects such as bloating and abdominal cramps. Thus, there is
      a clinical need for new, more potent drugs particularly for patients who are not 
      satisfactorily treated by conventional therapies. This review discusses recent

AB  - Growing evidence suggests a potential role of intestinal microbiota in irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology and symptom generation. Earlier studies
      based on classic microbiologic techniques hypothesized the presence of
      qualitative changes in intestinal microbiota in IBS patients. Recently, studies
      with molecular techniques have provided evidence of significant changes in
      microbial profiles in IBS and that the composition may be correlated with certain
      symptoms reported by patients. Although these studies are far from being
      exhaustive and conclusive they provide promising results that deserve further
      investigation. In addition, initial evidence indicated the presence of increased 
      amounts of bacteria in the upper small intestine of IBS patients, a condition
      know as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, the results of these
      studies have provided contradictory results suggesting that this area requires
      further work. These qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota
      may induce different effects on the intestinal mucosa including mucosal barrier
      defects and immune activation which may contribute to symptom generation. Studies
      in IBS patients have attempted to target changes in intestinal microflora with
      different therapeutic approaches, such as the use of prebiotics, probiotics,
      synbiotics, and nonabsorbable and systemic antibiotics. Overall, the results
      obtained in probiotic clinical trials suggest some beneficial effect over placebo
      in the relief of IBS symptoms. However, these results, although encouraging,
      should be confirmed in larger well-designed, placebo-controlled studies. A number
      of open questions remain to be addressed, including the dose, type, and time of
      administration of probiotics.

      patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a multicenter, randomized study.
PG  - S218-23
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31817fadd6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Efficacy of symbiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) remains unknown. METHODS: Patients were randomized to a prebiotic (n=135), 
      or a symbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 (Flortec,
      n=132). Primary efficacy was the responder rate for pain and global relief of
      symptoms in the overall population and in patients with predominant diarrhea
      (n=47). Post hoc time-trend analyses for changes within each treatment were
      carried out. RESULTS: Patients with absent/mild pain amounted to 54.7% in the
      symbiotic group and to 57.4% in the prebiotic group at treatment week 4, and to
      53.9% and 53.4% at the end of treatment. Patients with amelioration of well-being
      were, respectively, 60.7% versus 61.7% at treatment week 4, and 63.3% versus
      60.9% at the end of treatment. Within each treatment group, patients with
      absent/mild pain increased in the Flortec and the prebiotic group, but time trend
      analyses were significant only for Flortec (P=0.019). In IBS-predominant
      diarrhea, Flortec significantly reduced bowel movements, pain, and IBS scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: To improve pain and well-being, Flortec is encouraging in patients
      with diarrhea predominant IBS. To establish its efficacy for the majority of IBS 
      patients, Flortec has to be compared with an inert placebo in future work.

PG  - 994-1002

AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with
      diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the
      possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal
      permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a
      randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients
      were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus,
      Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum)
      or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and
      intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of
      lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the
      total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel
      permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023
      (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel
      permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However,
      colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo 
      group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean
      global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/-
      1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment
      for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.

PG  - 830-40
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03801.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is founded on
      interactive mechanisms. Disentangling these processes is a prerequisite for the
      development of effective drug therapy. AIM: To identify the interaction between
      the various factors implicated in IBS. METHODS: Articles pertaining to IBS
      pathogenesis focusing on psychoneuroimmunology were identified using following
      search terms: IBS, animal models, microbiota, probiotics, immunology, visceral
      hypersensitivity, imaging, psychology and visceral pain. RESULTS: Cerebral
      imaging using MRI and proton emission tomography scanning has revealed
      differential regional cerebral activation, whereas stimuli induced activation has
      been captured by both MRI and cortical evoked potentials. At the peripheral
      neurological level, the concept of visceral hypersensitivity has been challenged 
      as perhaps representing psychological traits with symptom over-reporting or
      hyper-vigilance. Gut mucosal immunology is thought to be relevant with
      immunological changes reflected as peripheral blood cytokine level changes.
      Molecular technology advances suggest a role for microbiota by activating the gut
      immunological system. These interactions have been examined in IBS animal models.
      CONCLUSIONS: Translation of animal model findings to humans is needed to link the
      various psychological, neurological and immunological changes noted in IBS. This 
      analysis may identify patient sub-groups, which will ultimately be critical for
      drug testing to be focused accordingly.

TI  - What is the evidence for the use of probiotics in functional disorders?
PG  - 379-84
AB  - A rationale for the use of probiotics for a number of functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms and syndromes can be developed, and an experimental basis for their use 
      continues to emerge, but data from well-conducted clinical trials of probiotics
      in this area remain scarce. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has attracted the most
      attention; recent revelations regarding the potential pathogenic roles of the
      enteric flora and immune activation have led to reawakened interest in
      bacterio-therapy for this common and challenging disorder. Some recent
      randomized, controlled studies attest to the efficacy of some probiotics in
      alleviating individual IBS symptoms, and selected strains have a more global
      impact. Evidence for long-term efficacy is also beginning to emerge, though more 
      studies are needed in this regard. In other functional syndromes, data are far
      from adequate to make recommendations, but there is evidence for efficacy of
      probiotics in treating individual symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, and
      bloating. The interpretation of much of the literature in this area is
      complicated by lack of quality control, use of many different species and
      strains, and, above all, significant deficiencies in trial methodology.

TI  - [The efficacy of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease].
PG  - 1385-90
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host
      animals by improving its microbial balance. Probiotics have been used in the
      treatment of bacterial or viral induced acute intestinal infection. In recent
      years, some clinical studies have shown the therapeutic effects of probiotics in 
      the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or prevention of
      allergic disease. Evidence exists for therapeutic use of probiotics in acute
      infectious diarrhea, Clostridium difficile colitis and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Their exact role in IBD, irritable bowel syndrome and prevention of
      cancer has not to be determined. This review summarized the data about probiotics
      in gastrointestinal diseases and examine the mechanisms of action related to
      their therapeutic effects.

TI  - New insights into Lactobacillus and functional intestinal disorders.
PG  - 287-93
AB  - Intestinal microflora can be considered as a ''dynamic system'' that actively
      interacts with the intestinal epithelium and the local immune system. It
      synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), 
      it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a
      competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram
      variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be 
      ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to
      31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a 
      reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains
      (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the
      hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical
      findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may
      be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative 
      infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver
      transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically
      stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and
      in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead 
      to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria 
      and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact
      that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of
      Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for
      instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei
      subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new
      field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of
      safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in
      medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to
      validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli
      in the treatment of IBS.

PG  - 251-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria,
      affects 10-20% of the general population, with women 20-40 years old accounting
      for the majority of patients. Although variable and intermittent, IBS symptoms
      may persist for many years. Repeated referrals for medical consultation and
      diagnostic studies generate huge healthcare costs. Since there is no evidence
      that IBS leads to more severe gastrointestinal disorders, in absence of alarm
      symptoms or signs, an invasive diagnostic algorithm is not indicated. Optimal
      treatment for IBS still needs to be defined. The clinical approach is based on
      treatment of the prevalent symptom. When pain predominates, antispasmodics are
      the first choice. In case of diarrhea, loperamide is useful for reducing bowel
      frequency. Soluble fiber represents the first option in subjects with IBS and
      constipation or mixed IBS. Dietary integrators composed of probiotics and
      serotonin precursors are a promising therapeutic option.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common conditions seen in
      primary care settings. Despite this, there is no consensus as to the pathogenesis
      of this disorder or a consistently effective therapeutic regimen for many
      patients. This has encouraged the use of various alternative therapies from
      behavioral or complementary medicine. This review will address the evidence for
      alternative therapies, including the following: cognitive behavior therapy,
      hypnosis, elimination diets based on food antibody testing, nutrition supplements
      (such as fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics), and, finally, peppermint,
      l-glutamine, zinc, and cromolyn sodium. The review also explores the evidence for
      and the therapeutic ramifications of the hypothesis that increased intestinal
      permeability underlies the symptoms of IBS in many patients, and how a
      therapeutic plan that addresses nutrition, elimination diets, and nutrition
      supplements may be useful in restoring the integrity of the gut immune barrier.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized 
      by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency
      and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care
      services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely 
      multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and
      dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their
      symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report
      menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management
      include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress
      reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain
      sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the
      pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current
      therapeutic approaches for symptom management.

AB  - Therapy trials with bacterial compounds in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have
      produced conflicting results. This study was performed in 1988 and 1989, and was 
      re-analysed according to current IBS standards. Two hundred ninety-seven patients
      with lower abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the
      compound ProSymbioflor((R)) (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an autolysate
      of cells and cell fragments of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, or
      placebo in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients were seen weekly by the
      physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS symptoms. Responders had at
      least a 50% decrease in global symptom score (GSS) and in abdominal pain score
      (APS) reports at >/=1 visit during treatment. The responder rate in GSS to the
      drug was 102/149 (68.5%) in comparison to placebo with 56/148 (37.8%) (P <
      0.001), the improvement in APS was 108/149 (72.5%) and 66/148 (44.6%)
      respectively (P = 0.001). The number-needed-to-treat was 3.27 for GSS and 3.59
      for the APS report. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a mean response time of 4-5
      weeks for active treatment and more than 8 weeks for placebo (P < 0.0001).
      Treatment of IBS with the bacterial lysate ProSymbioflor is effective and
      superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients seen by general 
      practitioners.

AB  - The clear delineation of a postinfective variety of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), and the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade
      inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional
      relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly,
      provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes
      of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, 
      are also plausible. Although clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to
      emerge, a review of available trials emphasizes the importance of clear
      definition of strain selection, dose, and viability. The possible roles of
      cotherapy or sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or
      other agents, also deserve further study. The role of the enteric flora is
      evidently an area of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era
      of research and therapy for this common disorder.

PG  - S104-8

AB  - Recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics were published after a Yale
      University Workshop in 2005. A similar workshop was held in 2007, and the
      recommendations were updated and extended into other areas. The recommendations
      are graded into an "A," "B," "C" or no category based on the expert's opinion and
      review by the workshop participants. An "A" recommendation is made for acute
      childhood diarrhea, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, preventing and 
      maintaining remission in pouchitis, and in an immune response for the treatment
      and prevention of atopic eczema associated with cow's milk allergy. The group
      maintained several "B" recommendations in other areas of treating inflammatory
      bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Although there are significant
      studies in the "B" group, most "B" recommendations did not reach an "A" level
      because of some negative studies or a limited number of studies. Many reports in 
      the "C" recommendations were significant but fell short of receiving stronger
      ratings because of the size of reported patient studies, and also the factors
      that limited categories to the "B" rating.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The human gut harbours a complex community of bacteria whose
      relationship with their host is normally mutually beneficial. Recent studies
      suggest a disturbance of this relationship in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 
      the potential to correct this using prebiotics and probiotics. AIM: To review the
      mechanisms of action of probiotics and prebiotics in IBS and to assess their
      performance in clinical trials. METHODS: Articles relating to modes of action and
      randomized control trials of treatment were reviewed by searching PubMed using
      terms 'probiotic', 'prebiotic' and 'irritable bowel'. Small uncontrolled studies 
      in IBS were excluded. RESULTS: Probiotics can enhance gut barrier function,
      inhibit pathogen binding and modulate gut inflammatory response. They can also
      reduce visceral hypersensitivity associated with both inflammation and
      psychological stress. Probiotics can alter colonic fermentation and stabilize the
      colonic microbiota. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled trials of
      adequate design have shown an improvement in flatulence and abdominal distension 
      with a reduction in composite IBS symptoms scores. CONCLUSIONS: Each probiotic
      has unique features and IBS patients are heterogeneous. Future efforts should be 
      directed to identifying biomarkers of responsiveness to facilitate better
      targeting of treatment and hence improved efficacy.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal
      pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a 
      disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore
      therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more
      recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI)
      microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of
      probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an
      upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the
      host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article 
      explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might
      lead to therapeutic benefit.

PG  - 1775-80
LID - 10.1007/s10350-008-9335-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate whether probiotics improve symptoms 
      in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web
      of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for 
      studies that investigated the efficacy of probiotics in the management of
      irritable bowel syndrome. Clinical improvement was the key outcome of interest.
      Data were searched within the time period of 1966 through September 2007.
      RESULTS: Eight randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials met our criteria
      and were included in the analysis. Pooling of eight trials for the outcome of
      clinical improvement yielded a significant relative risk of 1.22 (95 percent
      confidence interval, 1.07-1.4; P = 0.0042). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may improve
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and can be used as supplement to standard
      therapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 2650-61
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition affecting 3%-25% of the
      general population. As no curative treatment is available, therapy is aimed at
      reducing symptoms, often with little success. Because alteration of the normal
      intestinal microflora has been observed in IBS, probiotics (beneficial microbes
      taken to improve health) may be useful in reducing symptoms. This paper
      systematically reviews randomized, controlled, blinded trials of probiotics for
      the treatment of IBS and synthesizes data on efficacy across trials of adequate
      quality. PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical trials,
      metaRegister, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
      searched from 1982-2007. We also conducted secondary searches of reference lists,
      reviews, commentaries, relevant articles on associated diseases, books and
      meeting abstracts. Twenty trials with 23 probiotic treatment arms and a total of 
      1404 subjects met inclusion criteria. Probiotic use was associated with
      improvement in global IBS symptoms compared to placebo [pooled relative risk (RR 
      pooled) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.62-0.94]. Probiotics were also
      associated with less abdominal pain compared to placebo [RR pooled = 0.78
      (0.69-0.88)]. Too few studies reported data on other IBS symptoms or on specific 
      probiotic strains to allow estimation of a pooled RR. While our analyses suggest 
      that probiotic use may be associated with improvement in IBS symptoms compared to
      placebo, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the
      methodological limitations of contributing studies. Probiotics warrant further
      study as a potential therapy for IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic 
      combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      We investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four
      strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of IBS. One hundred and sixteen
      patients with IBS fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized in a parallel
      group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x
      10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. The symptoms that were monitored weekly
      included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. Quality of 
      life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the SF36 and
      FDD-quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred subjects completed the
      study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). The probiotic combination was not
      superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS (42.6 versus 42.3%
      improvement). However, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the
      fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients
      (-41.9 versus -24.2%, P=0.048). Interesting findings from the IBS sub-groups were
      also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with
      alternating bowel habits (P=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the
      constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (P=0.043).
      CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the
      placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS. Despite the apparent high placebo response,
      interesting findings from IBS sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal 
      pain and stool frequency.

PG  - 496-505
LID - 10.1592/phco.28.4.496 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the use of tegaserod and alosetron -- drugs approved for the treatment 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -- has been restricted because of adverse
      events. This has resulted in a need for additional modalities for the treatment
      of IBS. Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of probiotics in the
      global relief of symptoms associated with IBS and in the improvement of
      flatulence, abdominal pain, transit time, and bacterial counts. Using the MEDLINE
      database from 1966-October 2007 and manually searching article references for
      relevant articles and abstracts, we identified 14 blinded, placebo-controlled
      clinical trials of the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of IBS. Of 11
      studies in which overall symptom relief was assessed, seven indicated a
      significant improvement with probiotics versus placebo. Five of eight
      investigations of abdominal pain and distention revealed a benefit with probiotic
      use. Four studies demonstrated an improvement in symptomatic flatulence in
      probiotic treatment groups, whereas one study showed no significant benefit. Four
      of five studies of the effects of probiotics on colonic transit time revealed a
      benefit compared with placebo. As probiotics have shown benefit and possess a
      favorable adverse-effect profile, their use may represent an option for symptom
      relief in patients with IBS. However, additional data are necessary before
      probiotics can become a standard of care in the treatment of IBS, a complex and
      chronic condition.

AB  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has increased over the last 50
      years in countries where a Western-style diet has been prominent or introduced
      and 20 - 65 % of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their
      symptoms to something in food that activates an abnormal response. However, data 
      from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although
      investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete
      review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre
      diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there
      appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this
      subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but
      dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear
      that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and
      probiotics in these areas.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria exhibit a variety of properties, which are unique to a
      particular strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 are new strains
      isolated from Korean infants' feces. The potential utility of Lactobacillus
      acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was studied. Forty
      IBS patients were randomized into a placebo (n = 20) and probiotics group (n =
      20). Four weeks of treatment with L. acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 was associated
      with a reduced score for abdominal pain or discomfort compared to the baseline (P
      = 0.011). The percent reduction in abdominal pain or discomfort exceeded the
      placebo scores by more than 20% (23.8 and 0.2% for probiotics and placebo,
      respectively, P = 0.003). There was a significant difference in the proportion of
      responders between the probiotics and placebo groups (P = 0.011). There was no
      drop out or adverse events for either group during the study period.
      Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 appeared to have a beneficial effect in 
      patients with IBS. Further studies are warranted.

TI  - Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) in childhood.
PG  - CD003019
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003019.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies 
      for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on 
      physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed 
      by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions 
      for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE
      (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO 
      (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and
      JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were
      employed. In addition, researchers working in this area were asked to identify
      relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of
      any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with 
      a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II
      criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials
      for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies
      were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were
      included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre
      supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one
      study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled
      odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.16 (95% CI
      0.45-2.87). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983)
      compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a
      form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to 
      follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three
      trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation
      with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two
      (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided
      analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% 
      CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on
      the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that
      fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are
      effective in the management of children with RAP.

TI  - Probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: an immunomodulatory strategy?
PG  - 684S-90S
AB  - The clear delineation of a post-infective variety of IBS, as well as the
      description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade inflammation and
      immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional relationship between
      the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly, provide a clear
      rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes of action,
      including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also
      plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to emerge, a
      review of available trials emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of
      strain selection, dose and viability. The possible roles of co-therapy or
      sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or other agents
      also deserves further study. The role of the enteric flora is evidently an area
      of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era of research and
      therapy for this common disorder.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria are used to treat or prevent a broad range of human diseases, 
      conditions, and syndromes. In addition, there are areas of medical use that have 
      been proposed for future probiotic applications. Randomized double-blind studies 
      have provided evidence of probiotic effectiveness for the treatment and
      prevention of acute diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, as well as for the 
      prevention of cow milk-induced food allergy in infants and young children.
      Research studies have also provided evidence of effectiveness for the prevention 
      of traveler's diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile-induced colitis, and
      urinary tract infections. There are also studies indicating that probiotics may
      be useful for prevention of respiratory infections in children, dental caries,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Areas of future
      interest for the application of probiotics include colon and bladder cancers,
      diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The probiotics with the greatest number of
      proven benefits are Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and Saccharomyces
      boulardii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects
      for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND 
      METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in
      gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases.
      RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular
      probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
      rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for
      irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's
      disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these
      patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies
      that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required.
      The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human
      trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation
      of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may
      have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the
      functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select
      disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed
      placebo-controlled studies.

TI  - [Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917
      (EcN): a retrospective survey].
PG  - 888-92
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In many patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one
      symptom is predominant (e.g., diarrhea, constipation, meteorism, or alternating
      stool consistency). For IBS therapy, probiotic drugs such as Mutaflor (active
      ingredient: Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 [EcN]) are also being used. A
      systematic survey on the efficacy and safety of EcN in different IBS subgroups is
      still missing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a gastroenterologic outpatient practice, 
      results of 150 IBS patients treated with EcN were evaluated retrospectively. Most
      IBS patients enrolled belonged to the subgroups "diarrhea", "meteorism", and
      "alternating stool consistency". RESULTS: Regarding the diarrhea subgroup, not
      only a statistically significant improvement in stool frequency was observed, but
      also a marked improvement in concomitant symptoms such as abnormal urge,
      flatulence, and abdominal fullness. These complaints improved under EcN therapy
      in the other IBS subgroups as well, so that efficacy was assessed as "good to
      very good" in 73.4% of all cases. Tolerance to treatment was "good to very good" 
      in 97.9% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The results point to the possibility of EcN
      being a therapeutic option for patients of various IBS subgroups which is almost 
      free of side effects.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of colonic disorders.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended
      for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including
      diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have 
      been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
      colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should 
      we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or
      strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics
      have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some 
      coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain
      diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as
      well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to
      mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately
      designed trials are needed.

TI  - The role of probiotics in management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 393-400
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects a significant proportion of the North
      American population; however, the etiology and pathophysiology of this disease
      remain poorly understood, and treatment is focused on symptom management. Over
      the years, research has revealed that the bacterial flora in the human gut
      interact with the bowel in a complex and dynamic relationship and may be
      responsible for the induction and progression of some of the pathophysiologic
      aspects of IBS. Probiotics are nonpathogenic bacteria that benefit the host, and 
      the roles they can play in the bacterio-gut relationship provide hope of a safe
      treatment that would allow for modulation of IBS disease states. Probiotic
      treatment for IBS has undergone significant exploration, yet the exact
      therapeutic effects and doses of these beneficial bacteria remain unclear due to 
      the conflicting nature of available evidence. This review discusses the evidence 
      from randomized controlled trials on probiotic treatment of IBS and presents the 
      current understanding of the mechanisms of action of probiotics as they apply to 
      IBS and provides a plausible explanation for the variability in evidence
      documented by the various trials under review.

TI  - Bacteria: a new player in gastrointestinal motility disorders--infections,
      bacterial overgrowth, and probiotics.
PG  - 735-48, xi
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may result from a dysfunctional interaction
      between the indigenous flora and the intestinal mucosa, which in turn leads to
      immune activation in the colonic mucosa. Some propose that bacterial overgrowth
      is a common causative factor in the pathogenesis of symptoms in IBS; others point
      to evidence suggesting that the cause stems from more subtle qualitative changes 
      in the colonic flora. Bacterial overgrowth will probably prove not to be a major 
      factor in what will eventually be defined as IBS. Nevertheless, short-term
      therapy with either antibiotics or probiotics seems to reduce symptoms among IBS 
      patients. However, in the long term, safety issues will favor the probiotic
      approach; results of long-term studies with these agents are eagerly awaited.

TI  - Effects of symbiotic preparations on constipated irritable bowel syndrome
      symptoms.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies that are being
      used to treat different gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel
      syndrome, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. AIMS: Evaluating 
      the effects of a symbiotic preparation on symptoms and colonic transit in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and significant bloating. METHODS: We
      carried out an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter trial on 129
      patients meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome who did not have
      lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing
      psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse. For three months, the patients were
      treated with a symbiotic preparation and were investigated trough questionnaires 
      on symptoms. Data on bloating and abdominal pain were obtained using the
      McNemar-Bowker's test, while data on stool frequency were evaluated using the
      t-test. RESULTS: The administration of a symbiotic preparation to these patients 
      modified the clinical picture and intestinal function, with a significant
      increase of stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, although the study had an
      open design, represent a further analysis of positive symbiotic effects on
      clinical manifestations and intestinal function in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome.

TI  - Clinical trial: multispecies probiotic supplementation alleviates the symptoms of
      irritable bowel syndrome and stabilizes intestinal microbiota.
PG  - 48-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common diagnosis in
      gastroenterology. Trials suggest certain probiotics to be beneficial. AIM: To
      investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii
      JS and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality 
      of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel
      syndrome. METHODS: Eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (Rome II
      criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month
      intervention. Patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies
      probiotic supplementation or placebo. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality 
      of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum
      cytokines and sensitive C-reactive protein were monitored. RESULTS: The composite
      irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% CI: -19
      to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% CI: -8
      to 1) with placebo (P = 0.0083). Especially, distension and abdominal pain were
      affected. A stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota
      similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1),
      while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). No differences were seen in
      C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: This multispecies probiotic seems to be an
      effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and 
      to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Probiotic agents in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 583-9
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by abdominal pain and alterations
      in bowel habits. Several pathogenetic factors, such as altered intestinal
      motility, visceral hypersensitivity, serotonin system abnormalities and psychic
      disturbances have been identified. Recently, a pathogenetic role of intestinal
      microflora has been shown in IBS: viral or bacterial infection can trigger
      post-infectious IBS; some patients have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth;
      the composition of patients' enteric flora is altered; and minimal inflammatory
      changes, consistent with the pro-inflammatory role of bacteria, have been
      demonstrated. Probiotics may, therefore, offer a rational therapeutic approach to
      IBS. The data available on the use of probiotics in IBS are still limited and
      results of controlled clinical trials are contradictory because they have been
      performed using different species, dosages, treatment durations and end-points
      for results evaluation. A critical evaluation of the therapeutic role of the
      various probiotics in IBS is presented in this article.

TI  - Recurrent abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome in children.
PG  - 581-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recurrent abdominal pain continues to be one of the most
      ubiquitous conditions faced by the healthcare team, and has a significant
      emotional and economic impact. We have moved from considering it a psychological 
      condition to recognizing the physiological and environmental contributions, and
      considering the condition in the framework of a biopsychosocial model where
      biology, psychology and social environment interact. Here, we review current
      studies addressing etiologies, diagnostic techniques and treatment options for
      recurrent abdominal pain in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies continue to
      highlight the role of visceral hypersensitivity in recurrent abdominal pain. The 
      psychological state of the child and the parent (most often the mother) in terms 
      of their anxiety, somatization and coping skills can, however, modulate the
      expression of symptoms. Diagnosis still is made by history and physical
      examination. Newer treatment options include relaxation and distraction therapies
      as well as medications. The role of probiotics in children remains to be defined.
      SUMMARY: The approach to the child with recurrent abdominal pain must include the
      recognition of the physiological contributions, and this information must be
      relayed to the child and parents. Acknowledgement also must be paid to the role
      of psychological state in the parent as well as in the child in modulating the
      severity of symptoms.

TI  - Almost all irritable bowel syndromes are post-infectious and respond to
      probiotics: controversial issues.
PG  - 245-8
AB  - Acute infectious gastroenteritis is the strongest known risk factor for the
      development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the most common functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders. However, knowledge about the incidence and prevalence
      of post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) in the general population is still limited. Some 
      of the published epidemiological studies on PI-IBS lack an appropriate control
      population, and were limited by a short follow-up symptom assessment
      post-infection. A number of risk factors have been associated with the
      development of PI-IBS, including the virulence of the pathogen, younger age,
      female sex, the long duration of the initial illness and the presence of
      psychological disturbances. However, much work has to be done to establish
      whether multifactorial mechanisms actually concur to the pathophysiology of
      PI-IBS. The discovery that an infective episode may trigger the development of
      IBS has not substantially changed the clinical management of this subset of
      patients compared to the classical (non-infective) form of IBS. Probiotics have
      been claimed to be of some benefit in IBS, but the majority of studies have been 
      performed in non-specific IBS rather than in PI-IBS and a number of issues still 
      remain to be elucidated.

PG  - 241-4
AB  - Several reports have described post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (Pi-IBS),
      while many animal and human studies have shown the presence of increased
      infiltration of inflammatory cells and hyperplasia of enterochromaffin cells in
      the intestinal mucosa after acute gastroenteritis. The potential value of
      probiotic bacteria in restoring normal gut function has been demonstrated by
      animal models of Pi-IBS. In humans, Pi-IBS can be prevented utilizing probiotics 
      to reduce the duration of acute gastroenteritis, despite the variable efficacy
      shown in randomized control trials evaluating unspecified IBS. Here, advances in 
      the pathophysiology supporting the post-infectious hypothesis are considered. In 
      addition, the current role of probiotics in the management of Pi-IBS is
      discussed.

TI  - Prescript-assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: an
      open-label, partially controlled, 1-year extension of a previously published
      controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1153-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to extend a previous 2-week assessment of a 
      probiotic-prebiotic complex in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      METHODS: In this open-label, partially controlled, 1-year (14 [2] months)
      extension study, data were collected from patients with IBS who continued
      treatment following a 2-week study of the efficacy of the probiotic-prebiotic
      complex. Data were collected at 2 and approximately 60 weeks after the end of the
      original study. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients entered the 2-week extension and 
      22 completed the approximately 60-week follow-up study (20 women, 2 men; age
      range, 20-70 years; all white). Results in the control group 2 weeks after
      crossover to treatment were similar to those from the original study, with
      reductions in IBS subsyndromes, as follows: general ill feelings/nausea (P <
      0.001), indigestion/flatulence (P < 0.001), and marginally colitis (P < 0.03
      [1-tailed]). Treatment was associated with a continued reduction in general ill
      feelings/nausea at 4 weeks (P < 0.007). At >or=52-week follow-up, the rate of
      remissions was 81.5% to 100% (P < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Based on the results from
      the present 1-year extension study, treatment with this probiotic-prebiotic
      complex may be an option for short-term (2-4 weeks) and long-term ( approximately
      60-week) reductions in IBS symptoms.

TI  - Current and future uses of real-time polymerase chain reaction and microarrays in
      the study of intestinal microbiota, and probiotic use and effectiveness.
PG  - 537-50
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the
      host when administered in adequate amounts. In addition to human health benefits,
      probiotics can improve various aspects of growth and performance in livestock and
      poultry, as well as control undesirable microorganisms in food animals. Studies
      indicate that probiotics can prevent or treat certain conditions, including
      atopic disease in infants, food allergy, infection after surgery, acute diarrhea,
      and symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding the complete
      mechanism, effectiveness, and potential use of probiotics is limited by the
      availability and sensitivity of current methods (i.e., culturing techniques). In 
      recent years, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays have
      become prominent and promising methods to examine quantitative changes of
      specific members of the microbial community and the influence of probiotics on
      the structure and function of human and animal intestinal ecosystems.
      Culture-independent studies have established that only a fraction of organisms
      present in feces are cultivable, therefore, results obtained by cultivation are
      limited. Conversely, in-depth knowledge of microbial genomes has enabled
      real-time PCR and microarrays to be more sensitive and has resulted in precise
      methods for comprehensive analysis of the complex gut microbiota. Additionally,
      these technologies can assess the influence of intestinal microorganisms on host 
      metabolism, nutrient status, and disease. This paper reviews method technologies 
      and applications of real-time PCR and microarray assays as they relate to the
      effect and use of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal
      disease.

      health-related quality of life and symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome in adults
      in primary care: a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
PG  - 475-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been rarely evaluated as a
      primary endpoint in the assessment of the effect of probiotics on the irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To study the effects of fermented milk containing
      Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 and yoghurt strains on the IBS in a
      multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 274 primary care
      adults with constipation-predominant IBS (Rome II) were randomized to consume for
      6 weeks either the test fermented milk or a heat-treated yoghurt (control). HRQoL
      and digestive symptoms were assessed after 3 and 6 weeks on an intention-to-treat
      population of 267 subjects. RESULTS: The HRQoL discomfort score, the primary
      endpoint, improved (P < 0.001) in both groups at weeks 3 and 6. The responder
      rate for the HRQoL discomfort score was higher (65.2 vs. 47.7%, P < 0.005), as
      was the decrease in bloating score [0.56 +/- (s.d.)1.01 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.87, P =
      0.03], at week 3 in the test vs. the control group. In those subjects with <3
      stools/week, stool frequency increased (P < 0.001) over 6 weeks in the test vs.
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a beneficial effect of a
      probiotic food on discomfort HRQoL score and bloating in constipation-predominant
      IBS, and on stool frequency in subjects with <3 stools/week.

      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium
      freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 by monitoring its
      effects on intestinal microbiota and markers of microbial activity. METHODS: A
      total of 55 irritable bowel syndrome patients participated in this
      placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Subjects received either multispecies
      probiotic or placebo supplementation daily during a 6-month period. The
      composition of intestinal microbiota was analysed with real-time polymerase chain
      reaction, short-chain fatty acids with gas chromatography and enzymes with
      spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Each supplemented probiotic strain was detected in
      faecal samples. Intestinal microbiota remained stable during the trial, except
      for Bifidobacterium spp., which increased in the placebo group and decreased in
      the probiotic group (P = 0.028). No changes in short-chain fatty acids occurred. 
      A decrease in ss-glucuronidase activity was detected in 67% of the subjects in
      the probiotic group vs. 38% in the placebo group (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Factors
      other than the microbial groups and metabolites studied herein seem responsible
      for the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by the multispecies
      probiotic.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a difficult disease to treat because of its
      ill-defined triggers, variable clinical course, and unpredictable myriad of
      symptoms of varying severity. Both doctors and patients are frustrated by the
      insidious nature of IBS--a nonlethal disorder that destroys lives, relationships,
      and careers. Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but
      are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A
      combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and
      therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms
      characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients
      with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved
      serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS
      and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although 
      they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target
      normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients
      in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing
      pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy. Overall, treatment
      approaches for IBS should address multisymptom relief and improvement of overall 
      patient well-being.

AB  - The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome due to the heterogeneous clinical
      symptoms and coexisting psychiatric disorders is still controversial. Although
      several agents with different mechanisms of action are widely used in clinical
      practice, there are only few drugs available with strong evidence of their
      efficacy, safety and tolerability at present. The etiology of irritable bowel
      syndrome is considered to be multifactorial: experimental and clinical research
      on visceral hypersensitivity, motility and brain-gut axis involving its
      neurotransmitters and receptors created the foundation of novel therapeutic
      approaches. Albeit nowadays several drugs (alosetron, tegaserod) have been
      registered in a few countries for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome,
      further large clinical trials are required related to the new chemical entities.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].
PG  - 1619-26
AB  - Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for
      this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate 
      drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is
      impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for
      reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. 
      Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory 
      proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify
      treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral
      hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low
      doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists
      (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists
      (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis
      and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy,
      relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a
      possible treatment in the future.

TI  - Recommendations on chronic constipation (including constipation associated with
      irritable bowel syndrome) treatment.
PG  - 3B-22B
AB  - While chronic constipation (CC) has a high prevalence in primary care, there are 
      no existing treatment recommendations to guide health care professionals. To
      address this, a consensus group of 10 gastroenterologists was formed to develop
      treatment recommendations. Although constipation may occur as a result of organic
      disease, the present paper addresses only the management of primary CC or
      constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. The final consensus group 
      was assembled and the recommendations were created following the exact process
      outlined by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology for the following areas:
      epidemiology, quality of life and threshold for treatment; definitions and
      diagnostic criteria; lifestyle changes; bulking agents and stool softeners;
      osmotic agents; prokinetics; stimulant laxatives; suppositories; enemas; other
      drugs; biofeedback and behavioural approaches; surgery; and probiotics. A
      treatment algorithm was developed by the group for CC and constipation associated
      with irritable bowel syndrome. Where possible, an evidence-based approach and
      expert opinions were used to develop the statements in areas with insufficient
      evidence. The nature of the underlying pathophysiology for constipation is often 
      unclear, and it can be tricky for physicians to decide on an appropriate
      treatment strategy for the individual patient. The myriad of treatment options
      available to Canadian physicians can be confusing; thus, the main aim of the
      recommendations and treatment algorithm is to optimize the approach in clinical
      care based on available evidence.

TI  - [Pre- and probiotics].
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to
      provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated
      actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological
      system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the
      scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very 
      active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut
      microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism.
      Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short
      chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are
      necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen
      bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the
      intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre-
      and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and
      probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added.
      Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of
      antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future 
      studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the
      evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies
      of adequate duration.

TI  - Probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome: a rationale for their use and an
      assessment of the evidence to date.
PG  - 166-72
AB  - Probiotics, defined as live organisms that, when ingested in adequate amounts,
      exert a health benefit on the host, have been used for almost a century in the
      management of a variety of medical disorders, usually on the basis of little
      evidence. Advances in our understanding of the gut flora and of its relationship 
      to the host, together with progress in microbiology, molecular biology and
      clinical research have identified important biological properties for probiotics 
      and demonstrated efficacy in a number of gastrointestinal disorders. The clear
      delineation of a post-infective variety of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as
      well as the description, in a number of studies, of evidence of low-grade
      inflammation and immune activation in IBS, suggest a role for a dysfunctional
      relationship between the indigenous flora and the host in IBS and, accordingly,
      provide a clear rationale for the use of probiotics in this disorder. Other modes
      of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, 
      are also plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to
      emerge, a review of available trials emphasises the importance of clear
      definition of strain selection, dose and viability. This is evidently an area of 
      great potential in IBS and deserves further study at all levels.

TI  - Bacterial flora in irritable bowel syndrome: role in pathophysiology,
      implications for management.
PG  - 2-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may, in part at least, result from a dysfunctional
      interaction between the indigenous flora and the intestinal mucosa which, in
      turn, leads to immune activation in the colonic mucosa. Some propose a role for
      bacterial overgrowth as a common causative factor in the pathogenesis of symptoms
      in IBS; other evidence points to more subtle qualitative changes in the colonic
      flora; both hypotheses remain to be confirmed but the likelihood that bacterial
      overgrowth will prove to be a major factor in IBS now seems remote. Nevertheless,
      short-term therapy with either antibiotics or probiotics does seem to reduce
      symptoms among IBS patients. It seems most likely that the benefits of antibiotic
      therapy are mediated through subtle and, perhaps, localized, quantitative and/or 
      qualitative changes in the colonic flora. How probiotics exert their effects
      remain to be defined but an anti-inflammatory effect seems likely. While this
      approach to the management of IBS is in its infancy, it is evident that
      manipulation of the flora, whether through the administration of antibiotics or
      probiotics, deserves further attention in IBS.

TI  - A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Lactobacillus GG for
      abdominal pain disorders in children.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are common in school-aged 
      children; however, there is no reliable treatment. AIM: To determine the efficacy
      of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A
      total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia
      (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were 
      enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received
      LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study
      population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no
      pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6,
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI:
      4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely
      to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3,
      95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02),
      but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n =
      47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately
      increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.

TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus modulates intestinal pain and induces opioid and
      cannabinoid receptors.
PG  - 35-7
AB  - Abdominal pain is common in the general population and, in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome, is attributed to visceral hypersensitivity. We found
      that oral administration of specific Lactobacillus strains induced the expression
      of mu-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells, and
      mediated analgesic functions in the gut-similar to the effects of morphine. These
      results suggest that the microbiology of the intestinal tract influences our
      visceral perception, and suggest new approaches for the treatment of abdominal
      pain and irritable bowel syndrome.
