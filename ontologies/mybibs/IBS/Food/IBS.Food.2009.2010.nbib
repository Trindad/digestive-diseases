TI  - DNFB-DNS hapten-induced colitis in mice should not be considered a model of
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2087-101
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was
      originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation
      resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC
      experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the
      immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by
      skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS 
      on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge 
      on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were
      evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in
      comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild
      mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days.
      Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory
      response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement 
      of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the
      initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response
      appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral
      response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased
      Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can
      display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for
      the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food
      allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.

TI  - Current level of consensus on probiotic science--report of an expert
      meeting--London, 23 November 2009.
PG  - 436-9
LID - 10.4161/gmic.1.6.13610 [doi]
AB  - The present paper summarizes the consensus views of a group of 9 European
      clinicians and scientists on the current state of scientific knowledge on
      probiotics, covering those areas where there is substantial evidence for
      beneficial effects and those where the evidence base is poor or inconsistent.
      There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain 
      specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the 
      incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile
      infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in
      irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can 
      reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature
      infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other
      clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel
      disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori 
      adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel
      syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are
      reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of
      medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of
      lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to
      provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to
      treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom
      endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles 
      published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome',
      'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre',
      'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone',
      'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine',
      hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative
      entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide',
      'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated
      for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for
      explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of
      abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete
      evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are
      reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified
      58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS
      symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies
      suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements,
      lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor
      inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine,
      octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is
      the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various
      pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific
      symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to
      better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult
      syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous meta-analyses have recently assessed the overall clinical
      benefit of single therapy options and groups of therapies in the irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). By large, this should enable physicians to select from a number
      of therapy options available. METHODS: We entered dichotomous outcome data from
      121 IBS trials published over the last 35 years with different groups and
      subgroups of drugs (antispasmodics, motility-affecting agents, antidepressants,
      peppermint oil), dietary interventions (bran, probiotics), and psychotherapy
      (cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, hypnotherapy, relaxation techniques) into
      meta-analytic tools and estimate the overall efficacy (odds ratio, number needed 
      to treat). RESULTS: Highest efficacy is currently found for peppermint oil,
      followed by psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions and
      probiotics. Traditional antispasmodic therapy has a moderate efficacy, whereas
      the list of (partially failed or cancelled) motility affecting drugs yielded weak
      clinical results, and therapies by bran and fibers are of no value in IBS.
      CONCLUSION: Evidence-based therapy in IBS provides a number of effective
      treatment options beyond the fact that many novel compounds under development
      have failed to reach the market. An algorithm for clinical therapy decision is
      proposed.

TI  - Kiwifruit improves bowel function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with 
      constipation.
PG  - 451-7
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder of the
      gastrointestinal system, and is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea
      (IBS/D), constipation (IBS/C), and alternating diarrhea and constipation
      (IBSC/A). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week
      kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C.
      Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. 
      All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a
      baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a
      post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults
      consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4
      weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per
      day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and
      following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation
      records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly
      increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05).
      Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that
      consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4
      weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves
      bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in pediatrics.
PG  - 1217-31
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2548 [doi]
AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate, firstly, the relationship between
      diet and disease activity and, secondly, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and their relationship to diet among patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) using a cross-sectional design. One hundred sixty-five
      individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal
      questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal 
      symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., 
      the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation
      between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients
      reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain
      foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal
      pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status
      according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively).
      Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher
      consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured
      milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In
      multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were
      independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To
      conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and
      disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between
      diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be
      prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) motility, primarily gastric emptying, balances the hormonal
      output that takes place after food intake in order to maintain stable blood
      sugar. The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), work together to reduce
      postprandial hyperglycemia by glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibition 
      of glucagon release, as well as inhibition of GI motility and gastric emptying.
      GLP-1 is considered the more effective of the two incretins due to its additional
      inhibitory effects on GI motility. It is observed that patients on treatment with
      GLP-1 analogues or exenatide achieve a considerable weight loss during treatment.
      This is of benefit to improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore,
      weight loss per se is of considerable benefit in an even longer health
      perspective. The weight loss is considered to be due to the inhibition of GI
      motility. This effect has been studied in animal experimentation, and from there 
      taken to involve studies on GI motility in healthy volunteers and patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evolving to a phase II study in IBS, the GLP-1
      analogue (ROSE-010) was recently shown to be effective for treatment of acute
      pain attacks in IBS. Taken together, data speak in favor of GI motility as a
      central component not only in metabolic disorders but also in IBS, be it due to a
      direct relaxing effect on GI smooth muscle or a slow emptying of gastric contents
      resulting in a less outspoken nutritional demand on hormonal regulatory functions
      in the GI tract.

PG  - e1445-52
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-0467 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)
      relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or
      functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center.
      Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and
      received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry 
      and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal
      permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused 
      a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of
      abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up 
      (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved 
      in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P
      < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At
      entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability 
      test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of
      patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P <
      .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG
      significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children
      with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut
      barrier.

PG  - 134

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the
      development of ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our
      aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial
      compositions in UC and IBS patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify
      individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. METHODS:
      Faecal microbiota of 13 UC patients, 11 IBS patients and 22 healthy volunteers
      were analysed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) using
      universal and Bacteroides specific primers. The data obtained were normalized
      using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate
      approaches. The differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing
      the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Band profiles revealed that number 
      of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between UC, IBS and
      control group (p < 10-4). By assessing the mean band numbers in UC (37 +/- 5) and
      IBS (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in
      bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences 
      between IBS and UC. Biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower
      in UC (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and IBS patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than
      controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). Moreover, similarity indices
      revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in UC and IBS
      compared to the controls (median Dice coefficients 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8%
      (IQR 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). DNA sequencing of
      discriminating bands suggest that the presence of Bacteroides vulgatus, B.
      ovatus, B. uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes
      them from IBS and UC patients. DGGE profiles of Bacteroides species revealed a
      decrease of Bacteroides community in UC relative to IBS and controls. CONCLUSION:
      Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal
      microbiota in UC and IBS patients, while different patterns of Bacteroides
      species loss in particular, were associated with UC and IBS.

AB  - A new era in medical science has dawned with the realization of the critical role
      of the "forgotten organ," the enteric flora, in health and disease. Central to
      this beneficial interaction between the flora and humans is the manner in which
      the bacteria contained within the gut "talk" to the immune system and, in
      particular, the immune system that is widespread within the gut itself, the gut- 
      (or mucosa-) associated lymphoid tissue (GALT or MALT). Into this landscape comes
      a new player: the probiotic. While many products have masqueraded as probiotics, 
      only those that truly and reproducibly contain live organisms and have been
      shown, in high-quality human studies, to confer a health benefit can actually
      claim this title. Several human disease states have benefited from the use of
      probiotics, most notably diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases,
      and certain infectious disorders. Irritable bowel syndrome can now be added to
      this list. Although this area holds much promise, more high-quality trials of
      probiotics in digestive disorders, as well as laboratory investigations of their 
      mechanisms of action, are required.

AB  - Irregularities of serotonin function in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be due
      to changes in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan. Dietary
      alteration of tryptophan intake may impact upon the mood and bowel symptoms of
      IBS. We hypothesized that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS)
      patients would exhibit an increase in plasma tryptophan due to alterations in
      tryptophan metabolism. We also hypothesized that a diet low in tryptophan would
      reverse this change and reduce symptoms. Thirteen patients with d-IBS had fasting
      serum free and total tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, and 6 kynurenine
      metabolites measured before and after 2 weeks of a strict dairy-free diet.
      Baseline tryptophan parameters were compared with an age- and sex-matched control
      group. Changes in the specific tryptophan parameters before and after dairy-free 
      diet were correlated with symptoms of IBS and mood. Compared with the control
      group, d-IBS patients at baseline exhibited significantly higher free serum
      tryptophan (10.5 +/- 4.35 vs 4.75 +/- 2.43 mumol/L [means +/- standard
      deviation], P = .006) and significantly lower tryptophan dioxygenase and total
      tryptophan oxidation as measured by the kynurenine to free tryptophan and total
      kynurenines to free tryptophan ratios (23.37 +/- 10.12 vs 55.33 +/- 16.02, P <
      .001 and 49.34 +/- 17.84 vs 258.46 +/- 98.67, P < .001, respectively). Dairy-free
      diet did not modulate metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or symptoms.
      Tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway is inhibited in d-IBS, and a
      dairy-free diet does not alter this. Our findings are consistent with possible
      enhanced serotonin activity in d-IBS.

AB  - The effects of a probiotic acidified milk product on the blood serum metabolite
      profile of patients suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) compared to a
      non-probiotic acidified milk product was investigated using (1)H NMR
      metabonomics. For eight weeks, IBS patients consumed 0.4 L per day of a probiotic
      fermented milk product or non-probiotic acidified milk. Both diets resulted in
      elevated levels of blood serum L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Our results
      showed identical effects of acidified milk consumption independent of probiotic
      addition. A similar result was previously obtained in a questionnaire-based
      evaluation of symptom relief. A specific probiotic effect is thus absent both in 
      the patient subjective symptom evaluations and at the blood serum metabolite
      level. However, there was no correspondence between symptom relief and metabolite
      response on the patient level.

TI  - Should military dining facilities offer and promote consumption of
      probiotic-containing foods?
PG  - 770-83
AB  - Probiotics are defined as "live organisms which, when administered in adequate
      amounts confer a benefit on the host." The purpose of this review was to
      determine whether there is evidence-based justification to recommend purchase and
      promotion of probiotic-containing food in military dining facilities (DFACs).
      Peer-reviewed literature was searched to identify well-conducted systematic
      reviews and original research related to the efficacy of probiotics in preventing
      and/or treating acute infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory 
      tract infections, allergic rhinitis, dental health issues, and female urogenital 
      conditions. Probiotics may be useful for preventing and/or treating
      military-relevant health conditions. However, the available scientific evidence
      is not sufficient to warrant widespread procurement and promotion of
      probiotic-containing food items in military DFACs. Health care practitioners
      considering recommending probiotics should understand that health effects and
      clinical outcomes discussed herein are specific to the probiotic strain, dose,
      and method of delivery studied in the articles cited.

PG  - 1275-91

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about how to measure patient-reported outcomes
      (PROs) in IBS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emphasizes that PROs must
      be couched in a conceptual framework, yet existing IBS PROs were not based on
      such a framework. AIM: To perform qualitative analyses to inform a new conceptual
      framework for IBS symptoms. METHODS: Following FDA guidance, we searched the
      literature for extant IBS questionnaires. We then performed interviews in IBS
      patients to learn about the illness experience in their own words. We cultivated 
      vocabulary to inform a conceptual framework depicted with domains, sub-domains,
      and item categories, per FDA guidance. RESULTS: We identified 13 questionnaires
      with items encompassing 18 symptoms. We recruited 123 IBS patients for cognitive 
      interviews. Major themes included: pain and discomfort are different - asking
      about discomfort is nonspecific and should be avoided in future PROs; bowel
      urgency is multifaceted - PROs should measure bowel immediacy, controllability,
      and predictability; and PROs should divide bloating into how it feels vs. how it 
      looks. Symptom experience may be determined by 35-item categories within five
      domains: (i) pain; (ii) gas/bloat; (iii) diarrhoea; (iv) constipation; and (v)
      extraintestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We applied FDA guidance to develop a
      framework that can serve as the foundation for developing a PRO for IBS clinical 
      trials.

      symptoms: a pilot study.
PG  - 1065-71
LID - 10.1089/acm.2009.0090 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to assess the effects and tolerability of two 
      novel natural medicine formulations in improving bowel habit and abdominal
      symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The DA-IBS formula was 
      designed to treat diarrhea-predominant and alternating bowel habit IBS, and the
      C-IBS formula was designed to treat constipation-predominant IBS. DESIGN: This
      was a two arm, open-label, uncontrolled pilot study. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Subjects 
      were recruited from the greater Lismore area (NSW, Australia) in 2001. SUBJECTS: 
      The study included 31 patients who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS.
      Twenty-one (21) patients were classified as suffering from diarrhea-predominant
      or alternating bowel habit IBS and 10 patients were classified with
      constipation-predominant IBS. INTERVENTIONS: The DA-IBS formula consisted of a
      mixture of dried, powdered bilberry fruit, slippery elm bark, agrimony aerial
      parts, and cinnamon quills. The C-IBS formula consisted of a mixture of dried
      powdered slippery elm bark, lactulose, oat bran, and licorice root. The aim of
      each formula was to normalize stool frequency and stool consistency. RESULTS:
      Ingestion of the DA-IBS formula was associated with a small, but significant
      increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.027). Subjects in the DA-IBS group
      also experienced reductions in straining (p = 0.004), abdominal pain (p = 0.006),
      bloating (p < 0.0001), flatulence (p = 0.0001), and global IBS symptoms (p =
      0.002) during the treatment phase of the trial. Subjects in the C-IBS group
      experienced a 20% increase in bowel movement frequency (p = 0.016) and
      significant reductions in straining (p < 0.0001), abdominal pain (p = 0.032),
      bloating (p = 0.034), and global IBS symptom severity (p = 0.0005), as well as
      improvements in stool consistency (p < 0.0001). Both formulas were
      well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The DA-IBS formula was not effective in improving
      bowel habit in individuals with diarrhea-predominant or alternating bowel habit
      IBS, although it did significantly improve a number of IBS symptoms. The C-IBS
      formula significantly improved both bowel habit and IBS symptoms in patients with
      constipation-predominant IBS. Further research is warranted on C-IBS, as a
      potentially useful therapeutic formula.

AB  - The different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract are inhabited by
      populations of micro-organisms. By far the most important predominant populations
      are in the colon where a true symbiosis with the host exists that is a key for
      well-being and health. For such a microbiota, 'normobiosis' characterises a
      composition of the gut 'ecosystem' in which micro-organisms with potential health
      benefits predominate in number over potentially harmful ones, in contrast to
      'dysbiosis', in which one or a few potentially harmful micro-organisms are
      dominant, thus creating a disease-prone situation. The present document has been 
      written by a group of both academic and industry experts (in the ILSI Europe
      Prebiotic Expert Group and Prebiotic Task Force, respectively). It does not aim
      to propose a new definition of a prebiotic nor to identify which food products
      are classified as prebiotic but rather to validate and expand the original idea
      of the prebiotic concept (that can be translated in 'prebiotic effects'), defined
      as: 'The selective stimulation of growth and/or activity(ies) of one or a limited
      number of microbial genus(era)/species in the gut microbiota that confer(s)
      health benefits to the host.' Thanks to the methodological and fundamental
      research of microbiologists, immense progress has very recently been made in our 
      understanding of the gut microbiota. A large number of human intervention studies
      have been performed that have demonstrated that dietary consumption of certain
      food products can result in statistically significant changes in the composition 
      of the gut microbiota in line with the prebiotic concept. Thus the prebiotic
      effect is now a well-established scientific fact. The more data are accumulating,
      the more it will be recognised that such changes in the microbiota's composition,
      especially increase in bifidobacteria, can be regarded as a marker of intestinal 
      health. The review is divided in chapters that cover the major areas of nutrition
      research where a prebiotic effect has tentatively been investigated for potential
      health benefits. The prebiotic effect has been shown to associate with modulation
      of biomarkers and activity(ies) of the immune system. Confirming the studies in
      adults, it has been demonstrated that, in infant nutrition, the prebiotic effect 
      includes a significant change of gut microbiota composition, especially an
      increase of faecal concentrations of bifidobacteria. This concomitantly improves 
      stool quality (pH, SCFA, frequency and consistency), reduces the risk of
      gastroenteritis and infections, improves general well-being and reduces the
      incidence of allergic symptoms such as atopic eczema. Changes in the gut
      microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors
      involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable
      bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has
      thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical
      activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Promising beneficial
      effects have been demonstrated in some preliminary studies, including changes in 
      gut microbiota composition (especially increase in bifidobacteria concentration).
      Often associated with toxic load and/or miscellaneous risk factors, colon cancer 
      is another pathology for which a possible role of gut microbiota composition has 
      been hypothesised. Numerous experimental studies have reported reduction in
      incidence of tumours and cancers after feeding specific food products with a
      prebiotic effect. Some of these studies (including one human trial) have also
      reported that, in such conditions, gut microbiota composition was modified
      (especially due to increased concentration of bifidobacteria). Dietary intake of 
      particular food products with a prebiotic effect has been shown, especially in
      adolescents, but also tentatively in postmenopausal women, to increase Ca
      absorption as well as bone Ca accretion and bone mineral density. Recent data,
      both from experimental models and from human studies, support the beneficial
      effects of particular food products with prebiotic properties on energy
      homaeostasis, satiety regulation and body weight gain. Together, with data in
      obese animals and patients, these studies support the hypothesis that gut
      microbiota composition (especially the number of bifidobacteria) may contribute
      to modulate metabolic processes associated with syndrome X, especially obesity
      and diabetes type 2. It is plausible, even though not exclusive, that these
      effects are linked to the microbiota-induced changes and it is feasible to
      conclude that their mechanisms fit into the prebiotic effect. However, the role
      of such changes in these health benefits remains to be definitively proven. As a 
      result of the research activity that followed the publication of the prebiotic
      concept 15 years ago, it has become clear that products that cause a selective
      modification in the gut microbiota's composition and/or activity(ies) and thus
      strengthens normobiosis could either induce beneficial physiological effects in
      the colon and also in extra-intestinal compartments or contribute towards
      reducing the risk of dysbiosis and associated intestinal and systemic
      pathologies.

AB  - IBS is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent 
      abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a
      functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical
      abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and
      judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with
      typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is
      based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective
      patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations,
      pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is
      recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and 
      impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment,
      and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms.
      Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This
      Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and
      management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well
      as reduced health-care costs.

AB  - Clinicians have long learned of the pathogenic microorganisms that cause
      intestinal infections and that can be identified by culture methods from fecal,
      mucosa and blood samples. Nevertheless, much progress has been made due, in large
      part, to molecular biology which has enabled the discovery of pathogens that are 
      not (yet) able to be cultured, but also to the protective role of some
      microorganisms within the microbiota. Ecological and clinical disturbances
      related to antibiotic therapy were decisive for demonstrating the beneficial
      effects of the endogenous microbiota and establishing the beneficial effects of
      biotherapeutic agents, known as probiotics. Most areas of gastroenterology
      (cryptogenic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, lymphomas,
      etc.), but also those in medicine overall (obesity for example), are affected by 
      this new approach and are showing very significant progress. This article
      summarizes the historical steps of these discoveries and reviews what the
      "modern" clinician should know in this very dynamic area in regard to research
      and practical consequences.

AB  - Intestinal microbiota is essential for gut homeostasis. Specifically, the
      microorganisms inhabiting the gut lumen interact with the intestinal immune
      system, supply key nutrients for the major components of the gut wall, and
      modulate energy metabolism. Host-microbiome interactions can be either beneficial
      or deleterious, driving gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue activities and shaping
      gut wall structures. This overview briefly focuses on the potential role played
      by abnormalities in gut microbiota and relative responses of the gastrointestinal
      tract in the determination of important pathological conditions such as the
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.

      and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 268-76
LID - 10.1016/j.tox.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Lactose and food intolerance cause a wide range of gut and systemic symptoms,
      including gas, gut pain, diarrhoea or constipation, severe headaches, severe
      fatigue, loss of cognitive functions such as concentration, memory and reasoning,
      muscle and joint pain, heart palpitations, and a variety of allergies (Matthews
      and Campbell, 2000; Matthews et al., 2005; Waud et al., 2008). These can be
      explained by the production of toxic metabolites from gut bacteria, as a result
      of anaerobic digestion of carbohydrates and other foods, not absorbed in the
      small intestine. These metabolites include alcohols, diols such as butan 2,3
      diol, ketones, acids, and aldehydes such as methylglyoxal (Campbell et al., 2005,
      2009). These 'toxins' induce calcium signals in bacteria and affect their growth,
      thereby acting to modify the balance of microflora in the gut (Campbell et al.,
      2004, 2007a,b). These bacterial 'toxins' also affect signalling mechanisms in
      cells around the body, thereby explaining the wide range of symptoms in people
      with food intolerance. This new mechanism also explains the most common referral 
      to gastroenterologists, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the illness that
      afflicted Charles Darwin for 50 years (Campbell and Matthews, 2005a,b). We
      propose it will lead to a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of type 2 
      diabetes and some cancers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. Our aim was to
      determine whether IBS-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during
      multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. 
      rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and
      Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The intervention has previously been shown to
      successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS. METHODS: The faecal
      microbiotas of 42 IBS subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind
      multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight bacterial targets within the
      gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative IBS association were measured.
      RESULTS: A phylotype with 94% similarity to Ruminococcus torques remained
      abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during
      the intervention (P = 0.02 at 6 months). In addition, the clostridial phylotype, 
      Clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention
      (P = 0.00 and P = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). The bacterial
      alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific 
      alterations in the IBS-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16S rDNA
      phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of IBS. These changes
      may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.

      the study with solid-phase immune-enzyme detection of the ovalbumin blood level
      after consumption of egg whites. Patient complaints and quality of life were
      assessed. The same blood samples were tested for content of the total IgE and
      specific to food IgE (13 food allergens); specific to food IgG (24 food
      allergens). The abnormal intestinal permeability was found in 38% IBS patients,
      also the degree of abdominal pain was significantly higher and quality of life
      was lower in this patients. The abnormal intestinal permeability was found more
      frequently in IBS-C patients High levels of IgE and IgG were detected in a few
      IBS patients.

TI  - Coeliac disease in China, a field waiting for exploration.
PG  - 472-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: no systematic studies on the prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) have 
      been reported from China. In western populations CD is more common in patients
      with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in diarrhoea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). We have screened patients with these conditions
      presenting to the outpatient department of a large hospital of "Traditional
      Chinese Medicine" (TCM) in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, P.R. China. METHODS: we
      tested sera of 78 unrelated Han Chinese patients (5 IDDM and 73 D-IBS), using
      ELISA serological tests for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA) and IgA
      anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG). RESULTS: six out of 78
      patients (7.7%) were positive for IgG-AGA (two men and four women) and two (2.6%)
      were positive for IgA-tTGs. One of the latter patients was negative for IgG-AGA. 
      Besides, one patient had a dubious IgA-tTG antibody and a positive IgG-AGA. None 
      of the six patients agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Two out of these six
      patients followed a gluten-free diet for one year. In one patient the diarrhoea
      ceased and his body weight increased. Another stopped losing weight. CONCLUSIONS:
      this study previously published as a letter in GUT (Wu J, Xia B, von Blomberg
      BME, Zhao C, Yang XW, Crusius JBA, Pena AS. Coeliac disease: emerging in China?
      Gut 2010; 59(3): 418-9) demonstrated that CD may exist in the Jiangsu province of
      P.R. China. The present article draws attention to the difficulties of following 
      a standard protocol in China such as established in western countries and
      highlights important factors less well known in the west in relation to the
      development of CD in China. Wheat production became significant in China between 
      1600 and 1300 B.C. After the Han dynasty (500-200 B.C.), wheat was one of the
      main cereals in China. One the major wheat fields in China is located in the
      Jiangsu province where the research for this article was performed. A review of
      Chinese literature shows that the predominant HLA-DQ CD risk alleles and
      haplotypes are present in the Jiangsu province. Genetic background, food
      consumption, and the results of our study suggest that CD should actively be
      investigated in P.R. China.

TI  - Manipulation of dietary short chain carbohydrates alters the pattern of gas
      production and genesis of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1366-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06370.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates
      (FODMAPs) in the diet reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In the 
      present study, we aimed to compare the patterns of breath hydrogen and methane
      and symptoms produced in response to diets that differed only in FODMAP content. 
      METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects and 15 with IBS (Rome III criteria) undertook a
      single-blind, crossover intervention trial involving consuming provided diets
      that were either low (9 g/day) or high (50 g/day) in FODMAPs for 2 days. Food and
      gastrointestinal symptom diaries were kept and breath samples collected hourly
      over 14 h on day 2 of each diet. RESULTS: Higher levels of breath hydrogen were
      produced over the entire day with the high FODMAP diet for healthy volunteers
      (181 +/- 77 ppm.14 h vs 43 +/- 18; mean +/- SD P < 0.0001) and patients with IBS 
      (242 +/- 79 vs 62 +/- 23; P < 0.0001), who had higher levels during each dietary 
      period than the controls (P < 0.05). Breath methane, produced by 10 subjects
      within each group, was reduced with the high FODMAP intake in healthy subjects
      (47 +/- 29 vs 109 +/- 77; P = 0.043), but was not different in patients with IBS 
      (126 +/- 153 vs 86 +/- 72). Gastrointestinal symptoms and lethargy were
      significantly induced by the high FODMAP diet in patients with IBS, while only
      increased flatus production was reported by healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS:
      Dietary FODMAPs induce prolonged hydrogen production in the intestine that is
      greater in IBS, influence the amount of methane produced, and induce
      gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms experienced by patients with IBS. The
      results offer mechanisms underlying the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in IBS.

PG  - 764-70
LID - 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181e63653 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of the contribution of race to irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-associated morbidity helps not only with health care policy decisions but
      also may provide important clues to the pathophysiologic interactions involved.
      METHODS: We conducted a survey at 9 different sites in our metro area. Subjects
      filled a questionnaire which included Rome II criteria for IBS. Subjects were
      asked about demographic and clinical characteristics. Subjects with a prior
      history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal cancer were
      excluded. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety subjects (670 African-Americans and
      320 Caucasians) were included in the final analysis. IBS patients had more food
      allergies and were more likely perceived to have poor health as well as physical 
      limitations. A reduced logistic regression model demonstrated that travel abroad,
      upper respiratory infections, tonsillectomy, and loss of appetite were
      independently associated with race in the IBS patients. There were no racial
      differences in physical or sexual abuse, loss of interest in life, or suicidal
      thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial similarities as well as differences in IBS
      patients of the two races support the concept that, while there is an important
      role for a biological component to the pathogenesis of IBS, it by itself may not 
      be an exclusive determinant.

TI  - Clinical trial on the efficacy of a new symbiotic formulation, Flortec, in
      patients with acute diarrhea: a multicenter, randomized study in primary care.
PG  - S35-41
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181e103f4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Few randomized studies have been carried out on adult patients
      affected by acute diarrhea especially in primary care, which is the natural
      context for this kind of disorder. Lactobacillus paracasei B 21060 is a novel
      strain of lactobacillus, which has been shown to be effective in relieving
      symptoms associated with diarrhea of irritable bowel syndrome subtype and in
      shortening diarrhea duration. In this study, we compared the therapeutic
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new symbiotic formulation, Flortec,
      containing L. paracasei B-21060, with lactobacillus GG (FlorVis GG) in the
      treatment of acute presumed infectious diarrhea. METHODS: Fourteen general
      practitioners working in the Perugia health authority district carried out a
      randomized controlled, parallel-group, open trial in 174 adult patients suffering
      from acute diarrhea (87 enrolled in the Flortec group and 87 in the FlorVis
      group). Both the products were administered according to their standard
      recommended dosage. The main efficacy criterion was the duration of diarrhea
      after beginning treatment. Treatment duration was 10 days. Enrolled patients kept
      a careful track of their symptoms noting them in a personal diary for 12 days.
      RESULTS: The 2 groups resulted to be homogeneous at baseline with regard to
      prognostic variables. The mean duration of diarrhea from the start of treatment
      in the Flortec group was 4.24 (2.73 SD) days versus 5.09 (3.72 SD) days in the
      FlorVis group (P=0.09).Clinical success rates in terms of absence of abdominal
      pain and absence of diarrhea (defined as <2 bowel movements of watery or loose
      stool consistency) recorded at different time-points were statistically superior 
      in the Flortec group (Kaplan-Meyer P=0.05 for both the symptoms). The physician
      judged that overall efficacy was good or very good in 91.8% of the patients in
      the Flortec group. The corresponding value in the FlorVis group was 83.7%
      (P=0.003). The 2 treatments showed a very good tolerability profile, with
      negligible and similar adverse event rates and similar concomitant medication
      usage rates. CONCLUSIONS: Oral therapy with Flortec proved to be more effective
      than FlorVis GG in the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults treated at a primary
      care setting.

PG  - 635-43
LID - 10.1590/S1807-59322010000600012 [doi]
AB  - Increased intestinal permeability is a likely cause of various pathologies, such 
      as allergies and metabolic or even cardiovascular disturbances. Intestinal
      permeability is found in many severe clinical situations and in common disorders 
      such as irritable bowel syndrome. In these conditions, substances that are
      normally unable to cross the epithelial barrier gain access to the systemic
      circulation. To illustrate the potential harmfulness of leaky gut, we present an 
      argument based on examples linked to protein or lipid glycation induced by modern
      food processing. Increased intestinal permeability should be largely improved by 
      dietary addition of compounds, such as glutamine or curcumin, which both have the
      mechanistic potential to inhibit the inflammation and oxidative stress linked to 
      tight junction opening. This brief review aims to increase physician awareness of

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The spreading of gastrointestinal diseases is growing all over
      the world. Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been
      found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of
      their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical
      studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic
      formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most
      significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the
      treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in
      irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on
      Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and
      altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance
      the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal
      ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and
      urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be
      particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further
      future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to
      achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in
      medical practice.

      to treatment.
PG  - 326-34
LID - 10.1016/j.tips.2010.04.008 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder with
      characteristic symptoms of abdominal pain/discomfort with a concurrent
      disturbance in defecation. It accounts for a significant healthcare burden, and
      symptoms may be debilitating for some patients. Traditional symptom-based
      therapies have been found to be ineffective in the treatment of the entire
      syndrome complex, and do not modify the natural history of the disorder. Although
      the exact etiopathogenesis of IBS is incompletely understood, recent advances in 
      the elucidation of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS have
      resulted in the development of novel therapies, as well as potential future
      therapeutic targets. This article reviews current and emerging therapies in IBS
      based upon: IBS as a serotonergic disorder; stimulating intestinal chloride
      channels; modulation of visceral hypersensitivity; altering low-grade intestinal 
      inflammation; and modulation of the gut microbiota.

PG  - 581-7
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833b6471 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the evidences for the usefulness of dietary
      manipulations (including the use of probiotics and prebiotics) in the management 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusion diets do not have a
      role in the management of these patients except in the case of malabsorbed sugars
      (lactose, fructose). However, recent work suggests that excluding these sugars is
      more effective in non-IBS than in IBS patients. Also, the first small open series
      on the use of very low (20 g/day) carbohydrate diet (VLCD) in IBS has been
      published with promising results. However, safety concerns do not allow us to
      recommend them. In the period of review, further evidence has been provided on
      the role of psyllium in IBS. Also, the available evidence on the use of
      probiotics in IBS has been meta-analyzed. SUMMARY: IBS patients should eat a
      balanced diet without restrictions, and (except for malabsorbed sugars) exclusion
      diets are not useful in most of them. The role of VLCD remains to be established.
      The concept that increasing fiber intake is useful for IBS may not be true for
      all patients, and hydrophilic colloids (e.g. psyllium) are preferred. There is
      growing evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of Saccharomyces boulardii in adult patients.
PG  - 2202-22
AB  - This article reviews the evidence for efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces
      boulardii (S. boulardii) for various disease indications in adults based on the
      peer-reviewed, randomized clinical trials and pre-clinical studies from the
      published medical literature (Medline, Clinical Trial websites and meeting
      abstracts) between 1976 and 2009. For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded
      controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies,
      volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of
      efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31
      randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029
      study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe 
      in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic
      efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be
      strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea.
      Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of 
      enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori
      treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C.
      difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult
      diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related
      diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The 
      use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both
      efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.

TI  - VSL#3 improves symptoms in children with irritable bowel syndrome: a multicenter,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181ca4d95 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem
      in pediatrics, for which no safe and effective treatment is available. Probiotics
      have shown some promising results in adult studies, but no positive study has
      been published on pediatric age. We aimed at investigating the efficacy of VSL#3 
      in a population of children and teenagers affected by IBS, in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted in 7 pediatric
      gastroenterology divisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Children 4 to 18 years of
      age, meeting eligibility criteria, were enrolled. The patients were assessed by a
      questionnaire for a 2-week baseline period. They were then randomized to receive 
      either VSL#3 or a placebo for 6 weeks, with controls every 2 weeks. At the end,
      after a "wash-out" period of 2 weeks, each patient was switched to the other
      group and followed for a further 6 weeks. RESULTS: : A total of 59 children
      completed the study. Although placebo was effective in some of the parameters and
      in as many as half of the patients, VSL#3 was significantly superior to it (P <
      0.05) in the primary endpoint, the subjective assessment of relief of symptoms;
      as well as in 3 of 4 secondary endpoints: abdominal pain/discomfort (P < 0.05),
      abdominal bloating/gassiness (P < 0.05), and family assessment of life disruption
      (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found (P = 0.06) in the stool pattern. 
      No untoward adverse effect was recorded in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: :
      VSL#3 is safe and more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms and
      improving the quality of life in children affected by IBS.

TI  - Do psychological factors predict symptom severity in patients with subjective
      food hypersensitivity?
PG  - 835-43
LID - 10.3109/00365521003797213 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined whether psychological factors such as general and
      gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety and depression could predict symptom
      severity in patients with unexplained, self-reported (subjective) food
      hypersensitivity. For the purpose, we translated and validated the Visceral
      Sensitivity Index (VSI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients
      completed questionnaires for Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, VSI,
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Questionnaire, and Subjective Health Complaints 
      Inventory. Relationship between scores on psychological factors and scores on
      somatic symptoms were studied by multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Most
      patients reported non-gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to their irritable
      bowel syndrome complaints, but general and symptom-specific anxiety, and
      depression could not explain a significant amount of the variance in somatic
      complaints. Gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety was a significant predictor
      of gastrointestinal complaints (p = 0.02), and age was the sole significant
      predictor of non-gastrointestinal complaints (p = 0.01). Approximately 90% of the
      total variance in symptom severity remained unexplained by the psychological
      factors. The Norwegian version of the VSI had satisfactory validity (Cronbach
      alfa = 0.93). Symptom-specific and general anxiety were significantly correlated 
      (r = 0.48, p < or = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological factors were not major
      predictors of symptom severity in patients with subjective food hypersensitivity.
      The Norwegian version of VSI had satisfactory validity.

PG  - 238-45
LID - 10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833982c3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) and eosinophilic colitis
      (ECO) are two forms of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal
      tract characterized by eosinophil accumulation in the mucosa or in deeper layers 
      of the gastrointestinal wall and associated with atopic disease. The eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal diseases broadened the spectrum of atopic gastrointestinal
      disorders formerly restricted to food allergy manifestating at the
      gastrointestinal mucosa. Their awareness increased enormously; therefore, we will
      review current knowledge about atopic gastrointestinal diseases for the
      allergologist. RECENT FINDINGS: Major attention will be drawn to the differential
      diagnosis, because symptoms of atopic gastrointestinal diseases frequently mimic 
      those of other chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) or irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), although the diseases are distinct in their histopathology, gene 
      expression signature, response to therapy, and association with allergies. The
      pathogenesis of EGE and ECO will be described that involves environmental and
      genetic factors, particularly food antigens and expression level of interleukin
      (IL)-5 and selective chemokines. SUMMARY: Understanding symptoms and pathology of
      such disease is the basis of a rational treatment based on reduced exposure to
      offending food antigens as well as anti-inflammatory therapy. Atopic
      gastrointestinal diseases are in many cases reversible; however, chronic
      treatment is often necessary to prevent relapse.

TI  - [Pharmacological treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome: a technical review].
PG  - 42-66
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The goal of a comprehensive treatment in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) patients should be the improvement of symptoms and improve the quality of
      life. AIM: To review the drugs recommended in IBS, their mechanisms of action,
      side effects, risks and benefits, contraindications, availability in our country 
      and the evidence supporting their use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A technical and
      narrative review which evaluated the articles published in national and world
      literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of IBS was performed. PubMed
      and IMBIOMED electronic databases were searched (until September 2009) using all 
      descriptors regarding IBS and drug therapy. RESULTS: There is enough clinical
      evidence to recommend the use of antispasmodics (alone orin combination) and
      tricyclic antidepressants for pain treatment in IBS. Laxatives are useful in the 
      management of chronic constipation, but there is little evidence in the
      management of IBS. Although, antiflatulents and antidiarrheals are widely used
      there is little information supporting its use. The use of a nonabsorbable
      antibiotic (rifaximin) is effective in a subgroup of IBS patients.
      Serotoninergics drugs have proven effective in relieving symptoms of IBS;
      however, these drugs require caution in their use. There are studies have shown
      that probiotics improve some symptoms of IBS. CONCLUSIONS: There are many
      effective treatment options in the symptomatic management of IBS. The choice of
      treatment should be based on the predominant symptoms of each patient.

TI  - Altered intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 493-8
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that alterations in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota may play an important role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) symptoms. However, an association between the composition of the intestinal
      microbiota and IBS symptoms has not been clearly demonstrated. In the current
      issue of the Journal, Tana et al. suggest that altered intestinal microbiota
      contributes to the symptoms of IBS through increased levels of organic acids. In 
      fecal samples, IBS patients had significantly higher numbers of Veillonella and
      Lactobacillus than healthy controls. They also showed significantly higher levels
      of acetic acid and propionic acid. Furthermore, IBS patients with high acetic
      acid or propionic acid levels presented more severe symptoms, impaired quality of
      life and negative emotions. These results are in accordance with the concept that
      the gut microbiota influences the sensory, motor and immune system of the gut and
      interacts with higher brain centers. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      observed in a subset of IBS patients describes quantitative changes in the small 
      intestinal microbiota. Data on qualitative changes in the gut microbiota in IBS
      patients are lacking. Different members of gut bacteria may have different
      influence on gut function. The concepts identified here may lead to the
      development of novel therapeutic strategies for IBS using manipulation of the
      intestinal microbiota.

LID - 10.1024/1661-8157/a000095 [doi]
AB  - A multimodal approach is state-of-the art for effective treatment of functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) like irritable bowel syndrome and functional
      dyspepsia. Based on the now established view that the pathogenesis of FGD is
      multicausal, evidence-based therapeutic options comprise education about the
      nature of the disorder, dietary modifications, relaxation techniques, behavioral 
      changes, and pharmacological treatments. These therapies are variously combined
      depending on the severity of the FGD and the individual needs of the patient. Our
      overview portrays the options for the therapy of FGD and proposes that these are 
      best provided by an interdisciplinary team of primary care physicians,
      gastroenterologists, and psychosomatic medicine specialists.

TI  - Crofelemer, a novel agent for treatment of secretory diarrhea.
PG  - 878-84
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M658 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and
      safety of crofelemer. DATA SOURCES: A literature search using the terms SP-303,
      Provir, and crofelemer was performed with PubMed (up to April 2010), Google
      Scholar, and selected Ovid bibliography searches. Additional references from the 
      bibliographies of articles included in the search, as well as company and Food
      and Drug Administration Web sites, were also assessed. DATA EXTRACTION:
      English-language in vitro and clinical studies associated with the safety and
      efficacy of crofelemer were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Crofelemer is a
      first-in-class agent that may be useful for different types of secretory
      diarrhea, since it prevents chloride and fluid secretion into the bowel by
      directly inhibiting 2 distinct intestinal chloride channels. Crofelemer
      significantly brought about faster symptom resolution in patients with traveler's
      diarrhea, along with lower rates of treatment failure compared to placebo-treated
      patients. In a post hoc analysis, crofelemer compared to placebo also appears to 
      have reduced abnormal stool weight and frequency in patients with AIDS-associated
      diarrhea. In a third trial, crofelemer did not offer a significant benefit in
      improving stool consistency after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, a significant increase in
      pain-free days was noted in female patients. Preliminary studies also show that
      crofelemer may reduce watery stool output in patients with infectious diarrhea
      such as cholera. Oral crofelemer seemed to be well tolerated in clinical trials, 
      with adverse effect profiles comparable to those with placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Crofelemer possesses a novel mechanism of action that shows promise in treating
      secretory diarrhea of several etiologies. However, results from further Phase 3
      clinical trials are still needed in order to fully evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of this agent.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.12 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) involves a broad range of physiological and
      psychological alterations that may affect brain-gut dysregulation, gut function, 
      visceral perception, and mucosal integrity and function. Despite advances in our 
      understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the role of effectors and
      transmitters in the brain-gut axis, a reliable biologic marker of IBS has yet to 
      be identified. IBS diagnosis and status depend entirely on an assessment of IBS
      signs and symptoms. This has made development of optimal end points and study
      design for evaluation of efficacy of IBS drugs a challenge. This article
      addresses three main topics: the evolution of primary end points for IBS clinical
      trials; a potential path forward for IBS end points in new clinical trials; and
      recommendations for the future development of patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      instruments for use in IBS clinical trials.

PG  - 966-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gut problem that
      interferes with many people's enjoyment of life. OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) is a common gut problem that interferes with many people's
      enjoyment of life. DISCUSSION: The underlying pathophysiology of IBS is not yet
      fully understood. People's experience of IBS can fluctuate over time and various 
      bowel symptoms may predominate. Many complementary medicines are used to treat
      IBS symptoms. Currently there is good evidence to recommend the use of
      probiotics, peppermint oil capsules and psyllium. Other therapies such as Chinese
      and Ayuvedic herbs and psychological techniques look promising, but further high 
      quality trials are required before these approaches can be recommended.

TI  - IBS or intolerance?
PG  - 962-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of specific foods to the genesis of symptoms in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been increasingly recognised in recent years. 
      OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the dietary triggers for IBS and the role of
      diagnostic testing in patients with IBS. DISCUSSION: In addition to the long
      standing implication of lactose in lactase deficient patients, fermentable
      dietary oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, together
      with very low carbohydrate diets, have been increasingly recognised as important 
      in the causation and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding their
      role and utilising the services of a practising dietician have become additional 
      important tools for general practitioners managing this common complaint.

PG  - 1109-12
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.03.021 [doi]
AB  - We have previously shown that ghrelin is mainly localized to the stomach but also
      occurs, together with the prokinetic hormone motilin, in endocrine cells in the
      proximal small intestine. This study explored ghrelin and motilin concentrations 
      in plasma in relation to gastrointestinal motility and whether plasma ghrelin is 
      changed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nine patients with
      severe IBS and 10 healthy subjects underwent stationary antro-duodeni-jejunal
      manometry; blood was sampled during similar motility phases in the two groups.
      The motility phases were monitored and blood samples were collected during
      fasting and after food intake. Plasma was analyzed for two forms of ghrelin
      (octanylated and desoctanylated) as well as for motilin. In IBS patients
      circulating motilin levels covaried with total ghrelin levels (r=0.90; p<0.004), 
      octanylated ghrelin (r=0.77; p<0.02) and desoctanylated ghrelin (r=0.69; p<0.04).
      No such correlations were seen in the control group. Octanylated ghrelin
      comprised 35.3+/-3.9% (mean+/-SEM) of the total circulating ghrelin in the IBS
      patients compared to 40.4+/-4.5% (mean+/-SEM) in the control group (NS). Ghrelin 
      covaried with motilin in plasma in IBS but not in plasma from healthy subjects.
      This suggests the two peptides act together in IBS.

TI  - Probiotic bacteria and intestinal epithelial barrier function.
PG  - G807-19
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00243.2009 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal tract is a diverse microenvironment where more than 500 species of
      bacteria thrive. A single layer of epithelium is all that separates these
      commensal microorganisms and pathogens from the underlying immune cells, and thus
      epithelial barrier function is a key component in the arsenal of defense
      mechanisms required to prevent infection and inflammation. The epithelial barrier
      consists of a dense mucous layer containing secretory IgA and antimicrobial
      peptides as well as dynamic junctional complexes that regulate permeability
      between cells. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer benefit to the host
      and that have been suggested to ameliorate or prevent diseases including
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel 
      disease. Probiotics likely function through enhancement of barrier function,
      immunomodulation, and competitive adherence to the mucus and epithelium. This
      review summarizes the evidence about effects of the many available probiotics
      with an emphasis on intestinal barrier function and the mechanisms affected by
      probiotics.

TI  - Treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics: the evidence.
PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1017/S002966511000011X [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of chronic abdominal pain, altered
      bowel habit and abdominal distension. It is the commonest cause of referral to
      gastroenterologists in the developed world and yet current therapeutic strategies
      are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in
      the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and IBS. Changes in faecal and
      mucosa-associated microbiota, post-infectious IBS, a link with small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth and an up-regulation of the GI mucosal immune system all
      suggest a role for the GI microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Given this
      evidence, therapeutic alteration of the GI microbiota by probiotic bacteria could
      be beneficial. The present paper establishes an aetiological framework for the
      use of probiotics in IBS and comprehensively reviews randomised
      placebo-controlled trials of probiotics in IBS using multiple electronic
      databases. It highlights safety concerns over the use of probiotics and attempts 
      to establish guidelines for their use in IBS in both primary and secondary care.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Treatment of functional bowel disorders of irritable bowel-type (IBS)
      in children remains a difficult task because of a lack of drugs with low adverse 
      event profile. We here report the results of a treatment study in 203 children
      (66 boys and 137 girls) age 4 to 18 years (mean: 10.5+/-4.5 years) with typical
      IBS symptoms with abdominal pain and either predominant diarrhea (n=50),
      constipation (n=56), alternating stool frequency (n=28) or unspecific pain
      (n=69). The average duration of symptoms prior to therapy was 175 days. Most
      (95%) patients up to age 11 were treated with a daily dose of 10 drops of
      Symbioflor 2 (SF2) (SymbioPharm, Herborn) (cells and autolysate of 1.5-4.5x10(7) 
      CFU of bacteria of Escherichia coli type), in the elder children 77% received
      this dosage, while the remaining received a higher dose up to 30 drops/day.
      Treatment lasted 43 days on average. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the
      treatment well and without adverse events. The key IBS symptoms (abdominal pain, 
      stool frequency) as well as the other symptoms (bloating, mucous and blood in
      stool, need for straining at stools, urge to defecate) improved significantly
      during treatment. Global assessment of therapy by parents and doctors was
      altogether positive. In summary these data confirm efficacy and tolerability of
      this probiotic compound in children and adolescents and supplement published data
      of probiotic IBS therapy in adults.

      OBJECTIVES: The study aims to quantify the maximum acceptable risk (MAR) of
      treatment-related adverse events (AEs) that women with diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are willing to accept in exchange for symptom
      relief. METHODS: RESEARCH DESIGN: A stated-choice survey was used to elicit
      trade-off preferences among constructed treatment profiles, each defined by
      symptom severity and treatment-related AEs. Symptom attributes included frequency
      of abdominal pain and discomfort, frequency of diarrhea, and frequency of
      urgency. AE attributes included frequency of mild-to-moderate constipation and
      the risk of four possible serious AEs. SUBJECTS: A Web-enabled survey was
      administered to 589 female US residents at least 18 years of age with a
      self-reported diagnosis of diarrhea-predominant IBS. MEASURES: Preference weights
      and MAR were estimated using mixed-logit methods. RESULTS: SUBJECTS were willing 
      to accept higher risks of serious AEs in return for treatments offering better
      symptom control. For an improvement from the lowest to the highest of four
      benefit levels, subjects were willing to tolerate a 2.65% increase in
      impacted-bowel risk, but only a 1.34% increase in perforated-bowel risk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Variation in MARs across AE types is consistent with the relative
      seriousness of the AEs. Stated-preference methods offer a scientifically valid
      approach to quantifying benefit-risk trade-off preferences that can be used to
      inform regulatory decision-making.

TI  - Potential benefits of probiotics--main findings of an in-depth review.
PG  - 110, 112, 114
AB  - Media reports on probiotics have been conflicting which has led to increased
      confusion among the general population and also among health professionals. To
      disentangle myths and reality, the British Nutrition Foundation has carried out a
      review on probiotics and health. There is good evidence that probiotics are
      effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and, although only few
      studies have been carried out so far, probiotic microorganisms also seem to have 
      the potential to prevent the potentially fatal Clostridium difficile-associated
      diarrhoea. A limited number of studies that are available on the effectiveness of
      probiotics on constipation have shown conflicting results, but promising results 
      have been found for certain strains. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms have been 
      found to be reduced by consuming probiotic strains, although a high placebo
      effect has been observed in some of the studies. The field of probiotics is
      relatively new and more studies will be needed to allow firm conclusions on the
      effectiveness of probiotic microorganisms for certain health issues.

TI  - Probiotics as therapy in gastroenterology: a study of physician opinions and
      recommendations.
PG  - 631-6
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181d47f5b [doi]
AB  - GOALS: The objective of this study was to determine how gastroenterologists
      perceive and use probiotic-based therapies in practice. BACKGROUND: In the United
      States, there has been a recent increase in research investigating the
      therapeutic capacities of probiotics in human disease and an accompanying
      increase in product availability and marketing. How medical care providers have
      interpreted the available literature and incorporated it into their practice has 
      not been earlier assessed. STUDY: A 16-question survey (see Survey, Supplemental 
      Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JCG/A14) was distributed to practicing
      gastroenterologists and physicians with a specific interest in GI disorders
      within a large metropolitan area. RESULTS: All physicians responded that they
      believed probiotics to be safe for most patients and 98% responded that
      probiotics have a role in treating gastrointestinal illnesses or symptoms.
      Currently 93% of physicians have patients taking probiotics most often for
      irritable bowel syndrome. Commonly used probiotics included yogurt-based
      products, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (Align), and VSL#3. Most surveyed
      physicians recommended probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic, and
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because they believed that the
      literature supports their usage for these conditions. However, physician practice
      patterns did not consistently correlate with published, expert-panel-generated
      recommendations for evidence-based probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      suggests most gastrointestinal disease specialists recognize a role for and have 
      used probiotics as part of their therapeutic armamentarium; however, the
      effective implementation of this practice will benefit from additional supporting
      studies and the eventual development of clinical practice guidelines supported by
      the major gastroenterology societies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and
      contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live
      nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance,
      particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces
      boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods.
      Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including
      lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic
      organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated 
      with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest
      evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment
      of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research
      is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
      There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be
      ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically
      contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut
      colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well
      tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be
      used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised 
      or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely
      occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at
      least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing 
      and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the
      gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often 
      conflicting.

TI  - Ischemic colitis and complications of constipation associated with the use of
      alosetron under a risk management plan: clinical characteristics, outcomes, and
      incidences.
PG  - 866-75
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.25 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Alosetron is a potent, selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist
      prescribed for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS-D) under a risk management plan (RMP). The RMP was implemented following
      cases of ischemic colitis (IC) and complications of constipation (CoC) associated
      with the use of alosetron. The objectives of this study were to characterize IC
      and CoC clinical features, outcomes, and incidence rates in the new restricted
      patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the RMP in the prevention of 
      serious outcomes. METHODS: Safety data from adverse event reporting from November
      2002 through June 2008 were reviewed for probable and possible IC and CoC using
      the US Food and Drug Administration/sponsor-defined criteria and definitions.
      Evidence for IC included medical documentation, colonoscopy, and
      sigmoidoscopy+/-biopsy. Evidence for CoC included medical history and
      confirmation from health-care professionals. RESULTS: Within the inclusion dates,
      29,072 patients received 203,939 alosetron prescriptions. Although the absolute
      numbers of IC and CoC cases have declined, the incidence rates for IC and CoC
      (0.95 and 0.36 cases per 1,000 patient-years, respectively) were similar to rates
      during the postmarketing cycle before alosetron withdrawal. In patients with
      severe IBS-D receiving alosetron (n=998) or placebo (n=411) in clinical trials
      since reintroduction, incidence rates for IC were 4 and 2 cases per 1,000
      patients, respectively. Rates for CoC were 2 and 0 cases per 1,000 patients in
      the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. No mesenteric ischemia,
      surgeries, transfusions, or deaths occurred in patients with IC and no cases of
      CoC were associated with toxic megacolon, perforation, surgeries, transfusions,
      or deaths. IC and CoC cases were typically of short duration and all improved on 
      prompt withdrawal of alosetron. CONCLUSIONS: Serious outcomes associated with IC 
      and CoC appear to be mitigated since introduction of alosetron under the RMP.

TI  - A comprehensive review of post-market clinical studies performed in adults with
      an Asian probiotic formulation.
PG  - 93-106
LID - 10.3920/BM2008.1005 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics as dietary supplements have been readily accepted by Asian
      populations. Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number
      of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western
      scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of
      Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on
      post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these
      publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the
      clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been
      used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel
      syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and
      mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and 
      to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs
      require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The
      information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical
      information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected
      outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore,
      identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better 
      clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.

TI  - [Usefulness of probiotics in prevention and therapy].
PG  - 345-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1249168 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics exert distinct effects on the intestinal mucosa and the immune system 
      that can be used in preventive and therapeutic settings. There is evidence to
      support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and
      pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to
      ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of
      probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics
      are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel
      syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role

AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between atopic disease and gastrointestinal complaints
      has been suggested. AIM: To explore the association between atopic disease,
      gastrointestinal symptoms, and possible gastrointestinal manifestations of atopic
      disease in patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity. METHODS: Symptoms, 
      skin prick tests, serum markers of allergy and intestinal permeability were
      recorded in 71 adult patients. Eosinophils, tryptase- and IgE-positive cells were
      counted in duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: Sixty-six (93%) patients had irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) and 43 (61%) had atopic disease, predominantly
      rhinoconjunctivitis. All 43 were sensitized to inhalant allergens, 29 (41%) to
      food allergens, but food challenges were negative. Serum total IgE and duodenal
      IgE-positive cell counts were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001) and both were
      significantly higher in atopic than in non-atopic patients (P < 0.0001 and P =
      0.003 respectively). IgE-positive cells appeared to be 'armed' mast cells.
      Intestinal permeability was significantly elevated in atopic compared with
      non-atopic patients (P = 0.02). Gastrointestinal symptoms and numbers of
      tryptase-positive mast cells and eosinophils did not differ between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity had a high
      prevalence of IBS and atopic disease. Atopic patients had increased intestinal
      permeability and density of IgE-bearing cells compared with non-atopic patients, 
      but gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ between groups.

      syndrome: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-10-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some probiotics have shown efficacy for patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum MF1298 was found to have the best in
      vitro probiotic properties of 22 strains of lactobacilli. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the symptomatic effect of L. plantarum MF1298 in subjects with
      IBS. Primary outcome was treatment preference and secondary outcomes were number 
      of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and IBS sum score. METHODS: The
      design was a randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. 16
      subjects with IBS underwent two three-week periods of daily intake of one capsule
      of 10(10) CFU L. plantarum MF 1298 or placebo separated by a four-week washout
      period. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (81%; 95% CI 57% to 93%; P = 0.012)
      preferred placebo to L. plantarum MF1298 treatment. The mean (SD) number of weeks
      with satisfactory relief of symptoms in the periods with L. plantarum MF1298 and 
      placebo were 0.50 (0.89) and 1.44 (1.26), respectively (P = 0.006). IBS sum score
      was 6.44 (1.81) in the period with L. plantarum MF1298 treatment compared with
      5.35 (1.77) in the period with placebo (P = 0.010). With a clinically significant
      difference in the IBS sum score of 2 in disfavour of active treatment, the number
      needed to harm was 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.9. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows for the
      first time an unfavourable effect on symptoms in subjects with IBS after intake
      of a potential probiotic.

AB  - Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a profound impact on quality of
      life for many patients and current treatments are sometimes unsatisfactory. This 
      controlled pilot study was conducted to evaluate effects of the proprietary
      GanedenBC(30) (Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086) probiotic on IBS symptoms, in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial including patients
      with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Patients were randomized to receive either
      B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 or placebo once a day for 8 weeks. Patients filled out 
      a quality-of-life questionnaire, and self-assessment diaries were provided to
      record stool count and consistency, symptom severity, and medication consumption.
      Of the 61 patients enrolled, six did not meet the inclusion criteria and three
      were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 52 patients with IBS-D, the average
      number of bowel movements per day was significantly reduced for patients treated 
      with B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 when compared to placebo (P = 0.042). Large
      variability in baseline scores prevented the assessment of severity scores and
      quality of life. This small pilot study provides evidence that the proprietary B.
      coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic is safe and effective for reducing daily bowel
      movements in patients with IBS-D.

PG  - 42-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Self-reported food hypersensitivity (SFH) is common. Psychological
      factors are assumed to be associated. We assessed anxiety and depression in SFH
      patients, using both questionnaires and interview. METHODS: Consecutive patients 
      (n=130) and randomly selected healthy volunteers (n=75) completed the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck
      Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-N) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).
      Seventy-six of the patients were also interviewed by use of the Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression
      Rating Scale. All patients underwent extensive allergological,
      gastroenterological and dietary examinations. RESULTS: According to interviews,
      57% of patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for at least one psychiatric
      disorder. Anxiety disorders (34%) and depression (16%) predominated. According to
      questionnaires, patients scored significantly higher than controls on all
      psychometric scales except for depression (HADS). We also found an underreporting
      of depression in HADS compared with interviews (2.5% vs. 16%, P=.001). Food
      hypersensitivity was rarely confirmed by provocation tests (8%). Eighty-nine
      percent of the patients had irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and
      depression are common in patients with IBS-like complaints self-attributed to
      food hypersensitivity. Anxiety disorders predominate. In this setting, depression
      may be underreported by HADS.

      probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the functional disorder

PG  - 690S-7S
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.113746 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically
      mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains
      have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to
      be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems
      effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome 
      is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural
      abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted
      appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show
      positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect
      is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of
      inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.

PG  - 213-8
LID - 10.1016/j.phrs.2010.01.004 [doi]
AB  - A new era in medical science has dawned with the realization of the critical role
      of the "forgotten organ", the enteric microbiota, in generating a variety of
      functions which sustain health and, when disrupted, lead to disease. Central to
      this beneficial interaction between the microbiota and man is the manner in which
      the bacteria contained within the gut "talk" to the immune system and, in
      particular, the immune system that is so widespread within the gut itself, the
      gut-associated (or mucosa-associated) lymphoid system. Into this landscape come
      two new players: probiotics and prebiotics. While many products have masqueraded 
      as probiotics, only those which truly and reproducibly contain live organisms and
      which have been shown, in high quality human studies, to confer a health benefit 
      can actually claim this title. Several human disease states have benefited from
      the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel
      diseases, certain infectious disorders and, most recently, irritable bowel
      syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria and, while a variety
      of health benefits have been attributed to their use, prebiotics have been
      subjected to few large scale clinical trials.

AB  - Recently, there has been strong interest in the therapeutic potential of
      probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). At the same time, there is a
      rapidly growing body of evidence to support an etiological role for
      gastrointestinal infection and the associated immune activation in the
      development of post-infectious IBS. In a more controversial area, small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been associated with a subset of patients
      with IBS; the issue of whether it is appropriate to treat a subset of IBS
      patients with antibiotics and probiotics is currently a matter for debate. Thus, 
      it appears that the gastrointestinal microbial flora may exert beneficial effects
      for symptoms of IBS under some circumstances, while in other situations gut
      microbes could give rise to symptoms of IBS. How do we make sense of the
      apparently diverse roles that 'bugs' may play in IBS? To address this question,
      we have conducted an in-depth review, attempting where possible to draw lessons
      from Asian studies.

AB  - Fibromyalgia and associated conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and
      temporomandibular disorder involve dysfunctions in central sensitization and pain
      modulation. Central nervous system dysfunction may also contribute to other
      symptoms characteristic of fibromyalgia, such as fatigue and sleep disturbance.
      Two key neurotransmitters in the pain modulation pathway are serotonin and
      norepinephrine. Preclinical studies using animal models of chronic pain have
      shown that pharmacologic agents that combine serotonergic and noradrenergic
      reuptake inhibition, thus augmenting the function of these neurotransmitters,
      have stronger analgesic effects than agents that inhibit reuptake of either
      neurotransmitter alone. Although tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) inhibit
      reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine and have shown efficacy for the
      treatment of fibromyalgia, long-term use of these drugs is limited owing to poor 
      tolerability. Unlike TCAs, the newer dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and
      norepinephrine, such as the drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for fibromyalgia, milnacipran and duloxetine, do not possess significant
      affinity for other neurotransmitter systems, resulting in diminished side effects
      and enhanced tolerability. Both duloxetine and milnacipran have shown efficacy in
      clinical trials by improving pain and other symptoms associated with
      fibromyalgia. Both compounds inhibit the serotonin and norepinephrine
      transporters; however, there is a difference in their affinities and selectivity 
      for these transporters. Although duloxetine has affinity for both receptors, it
      is somewhat more selective for the serotonin transporter. In contrast,
      milnacipran is somewhat more selective for norepinephrine than serotonin reuptake
      inhibition. Pharmacologic agents that specifically target serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake may prove to be valuable tools in the treatment of
      fibromyalgia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) varies depending
      on the criteria used to diagnose it, but it ranges from about 5% to 20%. IBS is
      associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor function and enhanced visceral
      perception, as well as psychosocial and genetic factors. People with IBS often
      have other bodily and psychiatric symptoms, and have an increased likelihood of
      having unnecessary surgery compared with people without IBS. METHODS AND
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following
      clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with IBS? We
      searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up
      to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check
      our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms
      alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
      RESULTS: We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met 
      our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of
      evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present
      information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following
      interventions: 5HT(3) receptor antagonists (alosetron and ramosetron); 5HT(4)
      receptor agonists (tegaserod); antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]); antispasmodics (including
      peppermint oil); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); hypnotherapy; soluble and
      insoluble fibre supplementation; and loperamide.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine quality of life (QOL) and dietary
      constituents in three subgroups of women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      based on the severity of their bloating symptoms. A secondary analysis of data
      from two studies of women with IBS (n = 183), ages 18 to 48, is performed.
      Measures include the Modified Flanagan Quality of Life Scale and a 3-day food
      record ( n = 95) and a daily symptom diary completed over a month. There are no
      differences in QOL and few differences in dietary intake, although women with the
      most severe bloating report less dietary intake of fructose ( p = .035) as
      compared with the women with less severe bloating symptoms. The findings suggest 
      that women with IBS who experience moderate to severe bloating symptoms may not
      reduce their dietary intake except fructose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postprandial symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been
      associated with increased bowel contractility. AIM: To compare ileocolonic and
      colonic responses to feeding in health and IBS. METHODS: We prospectively
      analyzed data from separate research trials in 122 IBS patients and 41 healthy
      volunteers. Ileocolonic transit (ICT) was evaluated before (colonic filling
      [CF]3h) and immediately after (CF4 h) a standard lunch at 3 h 45 min, and 2 h
      thereafter. The colonic geometric center (GC) was calculated 2 h (GC6 h) after
      lunch ingested at 4 h (GC4 h) and directly after (GC8 h) a standard dinner
      ingested at 7 h 45 min. RESULTS: ICT immediately after eating was higher in IBS
      diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) patients than in the healthy cohort (23.1 +/- 2.4
      vs. 17.5 +/- 2.8%, P = 0.059). ICT 2 h after lunch was similar between groups (P 
      = 0.55). There was significant overall group differences in colonic transit 2 h
      post-lunch (P = 0.045), particularly in the IBS constipation predominant (IBS-C; 
      GC6-GC4, delta 0.29 +/- 0.08) patients versus healthy volunteers (delta 0.56 +/- 
      0.12 GC units). CONCLUSIONS: After feeding, ICT is increased in IBS-D, whereas
      colonic transit is blunted in IBS-C.

LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2009.11.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A percentage of patients with symptoms of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH) and improve on a
      food-elimination diet. No assays have satisfactory levels of sensitivity for
      identifying patients with FH. We evaluated the efficacy of an in vitro basophil
      activation assay in the diagnosis of FH in IBS-like patients. METHODS: Blood
      samples were collected from 120 consecutive patients diagnosed with IBS according
      to Rome II criteria. We analyzed in vitro activation of basophils by food
      allergens (based on levels of CD63 expression), as well as total and
      food-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels in serum. Effects of elimination diets 
      and double-blind food challenges were used as standards for FH diagnosis.
      RESULTS: Twenty-four of the patients (20%) had FH (cow's milk and/or wheat
      hypersensitivity); their symptom scores improved significantly when they were
      placed on an elimination diet. Patients with FH differed from other IBS patients 
      in that they had a longer duration of clinical history, a history of FH as
      children, and an increased frequency of self-reported FH; they also had
      hypersensitivities to other antigens (eg, egg or soy). The basophil activation
      assay diagnosed FH with 86% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 87% accuracy; this 
      level of sensitivity was significantly higher than that of serum total IgE or
      food-specific IgE assays. CONCLUSIONS: A cytometric assay that quantifies
      basophils after stimulation with food antigens based on cell-surface expression
      of CD63 had high levels of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing
      FH. This assay might be used to diagnose FH in patients with IBS-like symptoms.

      patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 469-77, 477.e1
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.10.055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and could be diet related. We studied
      postprandial changes in distribution of water in the upper gastrointestinal tract
      of healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with IBS-D after contrasting meals.
      METHODS: In study 1, 11 HVs consumed 350-mL test meals with 5% mannitol
      (unabsorbable) or 5% glucose (readily absorbed). In study 2, 17 HVs consumed a
      331-kcal meal, with or without 15 g bran. In study 3, 26 patients with IBS-D
      consumed the study 2 diet with bran meal. All subjects underwent serial magnetic 
      resonance imaging analysis. RESULTS: In study 1, subjects' small bowel water
      content (SBWC) increased after the mannitol but not glucose meals, reaching 381
      mL (interquartile range, 343-491 mL) and 47 mL (18-78 mL), respectively, 40
      minutes after eating (P < .001). In study 2, SBWC initially decreased after both 
      meal types and then increased, plateauing at 180-405 minutes and was greater
      after the bran meal (P = .02). In study 3, fasting and postprandial SBWC was
      lower in IBS-D than in HVs (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively). Patients with
      IBS-D had faster orocecal transit times (135 minutes; 90-180 minutes) compared
      with HVs (225 minutes; 203-293 minutes; P < .0001) and reduced terminal ileum
      diameter (P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial SBWC initially decreases, because 
      of rapid, nutrient-driven fluid absorption, and then increases after a mixed
      liquid/solid meal. Patients with IBS-D have reduced fasting and postprandial SBWC
      with faster transit, possibly indicating increased small intestinal tone.

AB  - Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) commonly report the
      precipitation of symptoms on food ingestion. Though the role of dietary
      constituents in IBS has not been extensively studied, food could contribute to
      symptom onset or even the causation of IBS through a number of mechanisms. First,
      the physiological response of the intestine to food ingestion could precipitate
      symptoms in predisposed individuals; second, there is some evidence that allergy 
      or intolerance to a particular food can produce IBS-like symptoms, third, certain
      foods may alter the composition of the luminal milieu, either directly or
      indirectly through effects on bacterial metabolism, and thus induce symptoms and,
      finally, IBS may develop following exposure to food-borne pathogens.
      Anticipatory, psychological factors generated by previous negative experiences
      with food ingestion or other factors may also contribute though their
      contribution has been scarcely quantified. Not surprisingly, there is
      considerable interest in the potential roles of diet and food supplements in the 
      therapy of IBS; for the most part, the evidence base for such recommendations
      remains slim though certain probiotics show considerable promise.

PG  - S68-78

AB  - In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief 
      of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents,
      or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of
      dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary
      fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, 
      osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while
      loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of
      stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve
      symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower
      doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for 
      pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance
      to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin,
      metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical
      trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or
      lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic
      approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in 
      combination with pharmacological treatment.

AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common bowel disorder that markedly
      impairs quality of life of patients. The causes of IBS symptoms are not well
      known. Motility and sensibility disorders, a genetic susceptibility, stress,
      previous GI infections and food intolerance have been involved in the
      pathogenesis of IBS. Recent investigations suggest that alterations of the
      intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, in particular increased permeability,
      could modify the cross-talk between bacterial microflora and the host, thus
      leading to persitent "low-grade" inflammation and alterated GI motility and
      sensitivity.

LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e328333d73b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to highlight recent advances in
      knowledge of bacterial enteric infections. We focus on understanding of
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni infections,
      and to link these acute events with long-term consequences in a susceptible host,
      including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli and C. jejuni are zoonotic infections 
      that are acquired from exposure to tainted food (undercooked hamburger and
      chicken, respectively) and contaminated drinking water. Noninvasive E. coli
      O157:H7 elaborates Shiga-like toxins and protein effectors that are injected, via
      a molecular syringe that is encoded by a bacterial type 3 secretion system, into 
      infected eukaryotic cells. Less is known about the precise virulence properties
      of enteroinvasive Campylobacter strains, but both enteric pathogens are able to
      disrupt polarized epithelial monolayers resulting in increased uptake of
      macromolecules and antigens. SUMMARY: An improved understanding of the
      epidemiology, pathobiology and mechanisms underlying infectious enterocolitides
      will provide the basis for developing new intervention strategies including, for 
      example, the use of probiotics, to interrupt the infectious process.

TI  - Understanding the role of probiotics in supporting digestive comfort.
PG  - 47-55; quiz 56
AB  - Many people experience digestive discomfort at some time in their lives. It
      affects those who are healthy and unhealthy, and in some cases can signal a more 
      serious underlying condition. For most people the discomfort is minor and
      transitory, but for some it can cause regular unpleasant symptoms, such as
      bloating. More severe gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) can have a significant impact on health and wellbeing. There are
      relatively few options for people with digestive discomfort and/or IBS. In recent
      years the body of evidence to support the health benefits of consuming probiotics
      has grown significantly. This article investigates how certain strains of
      probiotics have been shown to reduce digestive discomfort and symptoms of IBS. It
      highlights some of the problems associated with poor digestive health and offers 
      guidance on educating patients about digestive comfort.

AB  - Probiotics are live organisms that are primarily used to improve gastrointestinal
      disorders such as diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, lactose
      intolerance, and to inhibit the excessive proliferation of pathogenic intestinal 
      bacteria. However, recent studies have suggested that probiotics could have
      beneficial effects beyond gastrointestinal health, as they were found to improve 
      certain metabolic disorders such as hypertension. Hypertension is caused by
      various factors and the predominant causes include an increase in cholesterol
      levels, incidence of diabetes, inconsistent modulation of renin and imbalanced
      sexual hormones. This review discusses the antihypertensive roles of probiotics
      via the improvement and/or treatment of lipid profiles, modulation of insulin
      resistance and sensitivity, the modulation of renin levels and also the
      conversion of bioactive phytoestrogens as an alternative replacement of sexual
      hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of probiotic bacteria in IBS remain controversial. AIM:
      To study the effects of a probiotic product on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We
      randomized 74 IBS patients to receive 8 weeks of daily treatment with 400 mL milk
      fermented with the yoghurt bacteria and containing Lactobacillus paracasei, ssp. 
      paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12
      (Cultura; active) or acidified milk without these bacteria (control). The primary
      endpoint was the proportion of subjects reporting adequate relief of their IBS
      symptoms at least 50% of the weeks. IBS symptom severity, psychological symptoms 
      and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was 38% 
      (14/37 patients) in the active group and 27% (10/37 patients) in the control
      group (P = 0.3). IBS symptom severity improved significantly in both groups
      during the treatment period. This change was greater in the active group during
      the first 2 weeks, but thereafter, no significant group differences were seen.
      CONCLUSIONS: We could not detect a clearly positive effect of fermented milk
      containing three probiotic bacteria on GI symptoms in IBS patients compared with 
      the control treatment. However, a trend towards a more favourable effect during
      the first weeks was seen in the active group.

TI  - Gastroenteric pathology and probiotics: from myth to scientific evidence. Current
      aspects.
PG  - 237-72
AB  - Starting from Metchnikoff's theory of cell-mediated immunity and work on
      lactobacillus over 100 years ago, more and more applications for probiotics have 
      been developed. Research into the health properties of probiotics has focused
      primarily on two areas: the interaction between intestinal microflora and
      enterocytes and the immune system and the use of probiotic products in the
      treatment of gastrointestinal diseases in adults and children. This review
      examines recent studies on the clinical use of monostrain and multistrain
      probiotic products in gastroenterology. The most widely studied strains are
      lactobacilli and yeasts, specifically, Lacto-bacillus rhamnosus GG and
      Saccharomices boulardii; the gastrointestinal disorders most commonly treated
      with probiotics are inflammatory bowel disease and dysbiosis, both of which
      clinically manifest as diarrhea.

PG  - 1296-303

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia may lead to
      therapy-resistant, long-lasting post-giardiasis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      We report two open pilot studies aiming to treat this condition, using either
      antibiotics or bacterio-therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty-eight patients with
      persistent abdominal symptoms, following clearance of G. lamblia infection, were 
      investigated. Eighteen received treatment with rifaximin plus metronidazole (8-10
      days) whereas 10 received a suspension of live faecal flora, installed into the
      duodenum during gastro-duodenoscopy. Customary abdominal symptoms and symptoms
      following a lactulose breath test were quantified by questionnaires. Hydrogen and
      methane production after lactulose were analysed in expired air and excretion of 
      fat and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was examined in faeces. RESULTS. As
      compared with pre-treatment values, total customary symptom scores were barely
      significantly reduced (p = 0.07) after antibiotics, but were highly significantly
      reduced (p = 0.0009) after bacterio-therapy. However, symptom improvement
      following bacterio-therapy did not persist 1 year later. Hydrogen breath
      excretion was slightly reduced after antibiotics, but not after bacterio-therapy.
      Compared with healthy persons, faecal excretion of fat was significantly
      increased in Giardia-cured patients. SCFAs were increased in the bacterio-therapy
      group, and were not influenced by therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Both antibiotics and
      bacterio-therapy were ineffective with respect to cure of post-giardiasis IBS.
      High faecal excretion of fat and SCFAs suggests that intestinal malabsorption of 
      fat and carbohydrates may play a role in the IBS-like complaints of these
      patients.

AB  - The dietary intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome was assessed using
      24-h dietary recall. The energy value and nutrient contents in the daily food
      rations were calculated by Nutritionist IV computer program with the Polish
      database. Differentiations in the Polish RDA coverage for energy and nutrients
      were observed in the studied group. Fat, saturated fatty acid, phosphorus and
      also vitamin A, E and C contents were above the RDA in the patients' daily food
      ration. The majority of IBS individuals did not meet recommendations for
      carbohydrate intake. Calcium and cooper intake was below the Polish RDA. The
      insufficient vitamin B2 intake and excessive Fe supply have been shown in the
      male patients.

TI  - Health-related quality of life of food allergic patients: comparison with the
      general population and other diseases.
PG  - 238-44
LID - 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02121.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date no studies have compared generic health-related quality of
      life (HRQL) of food allergic patients from childhood to adulthood with that of
      the general population or patients with other chronic diseases. The aim of this
      study was to compare generic HRQL of food allergic patients with the general
      population and other diseases. METHODS: Generic HRQL questionnaires (CHQ-CF87 and
      RAND-36) were completed by 79 children, 74 adolescents and 72 adults with food
      allergy. The generic HRQL scores were compared with scores from published studies
      on the general population and patients with asthma, irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), diabetes mellitus (DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RESULTS: Food
      allergic children and adolescents reported fewer limitations in school work due
      to behavioural problems (P < or = 0.013), but food allergic adolescents and
      adults reported more pain (P = 0.020), poorer overall health (P < 0.001), more
      limitations in social activities (P < 0.001) and less vitality (P = 0.002) than
      individuals from the general population. Food allergic patients reported poorer
      generic HRQL than patients with DM, but better generic HRQL than patients with
      RA, asthma and IBS. CONCLUSION: HRQL is impaired in food allergic adolescents and
      adults, compared to the general population, and it is intermediate in magnitude
      between DM and RA, asthma and IBS. Children show the least impact on generic HRQL
      from food allergy.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional digestive disorder, 
      and may affect 11-20% of the adult population in industrialized countries. In
      accordance with Rome III criteria (2006) IBS involves abdominal pain and bowel
      habit disturbance, which are not explained by structural or biochemical
      abnormalities. Several hypotheses attempt to account for the pathophysiology of
      IBS, but the etiology still remains uncertain or obscure, perhaps multifactorial.
      Abnormalities in colonic microflora have recently been suggested in such
      patients, as has abnormal small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), or in
      particular a significant reduction in the amount of intraluminal Bifidobacteria
      or Lactobacilli, with consequences like the production of colonic gas, and
      motility or sensitivity disturbances of the intestinal tract. The disorder is
      difficult to treat, and the wide spectrum of non-drug and drug treatments shows
      our ignorance about the cause of the condition. Newer drugs, both pro- and
      anti-serotonin, have failed to show long-term efficacy or have been withdrawn due
      to concerns about harmful effects. Recent research has provided increasing
      support for the idea that disturbances of intestinal microbiota occur in patients
      with IBS, and that such abnormalities may contribute to IBS symptoms. Studies in 
      Scandinavian countries in the last ten years emphasize the role of probiotics in 
      the modulation of intestinal microbiota, and as a consequence in the regulation
      of the motility and hypersensitivity of the digestive tract. Although results
      between studies are difficult to compare because of differences in study design, 
      probiotic dose, strain, and duration of therapy, some studies show symptom
      improvement. Lactobacilli are found among the normal bacterial flora of the
      gastrointestinal tract, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) is one of the species
      frequently isolated from the human mucosa, which is capable of surviving the low 
      pH of the stomach and duodenum, resisting the effect of bile acids in the upper
      small intestine when ingested, and temporarily colonizing the gastrointestinal
      tract by binding to the intestinal and colonic mucosa. Concurrent with
      colonization by Lp there is a decrease in bacterial groups with gas-producing
      ability, such as Veillonella spp. and Clostridia spp. Evidence has now
      accumulated to suggest the efficacy of certain probiotics like Lp299v, which may 
      be capable of bringing about a significant reduction in pain, abdominal
      distension and flatulence, while increasing health-related quality of life in
      IBS.

TI  - Evolving concepts in Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most important cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea. The emergence of a hypervirulent strain and other factors including
      antibiotic overuse contribute to the increasing incidence and severity of this
      potentially lethal infection. CDI has been reported in persons previously
      considered as low risk, such as young healthy persons without exposure to health 
      care settings or antibiotics, peripartum women, and children. In patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, the risk of C. difficile infection is even greater,
      with higher rates of hospitalization, bowel surgery, and mortality. With
      increasing incidence and severity of disease, the need for improved diagnostic,
      treatment, and infection control strategies cannot be overstated.

TI  - Fructose-sorbitol malabsorption.
PG  - 368-74
AB  - Important dietary carbohydrates such as fructose and sorbitol are incompletely
      absorbed in the normal small intestine. This malabsorption is sometimes
      associated with abdominal complaints and diarrhea development, symptoms
      indistinguishable from those of functional bowel disease. Recently, polymerized
      forms of fructose (fructans) also were implicated in symptom production in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evidence from uncontrolled and
      controlled challenge studies suggests that malabsorbed sugars (fructose,
      sorbitol, lactose) and fructans may act as dietary triggers for clinical symptoms
      suggestive of IBS. Further placebo-controlled studies are needed to obtain
      definite conclusions about the role of dietary sugar malabsorption in functional 
      bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotic-induced changes in the intestinal epithelium: implications in
      gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - There is resurgent interest in the use of probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal
      and systemic health, driven by recent advances in knowledge of bacterial
      interactions with the epithelium and innate immune system of the intestine. The
      effects of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal epithelium and their downstream
      consequences are reviewed. Probiotics prevent pathogen adherence and invasion of 
      the epithelium, partly by blocking adherence sites but also by upregulating gene 
      expression of MUC2 and of antimicrobial peptides. Metabolic effects of probiotics
      on the intestinal epithelium include production of short chain fatty acids which 
      influence epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis. Bacterial
      metabolism of unabsorbed dietary constituents with production of free radicals
      and phenolic metabolites can lead to DNA damage and cancer; probiotics restore
      eubiosis and potentially prevent this. Probiotics alter expression and
      redistribution of tight junction proteins and reduce intestinal permeability
      limiting absorption of noxious molecules from the gut lumen. Most studied are the
      effects of probiotics on epithelial cells which are the first line of innate
      immune-capable cells that encounter luminal flora. Probiotics, through secreted
      molecules, influence the innate inflammatory response of epithelial cells to
      stimuli from the gut lumen, and reduce mucosal inflammation. Through effects on
      dendritic, and possibly epithelial, cells they influence naive T cells in the
      lamina propria of the gut and thus influence adaptive immunity. These varied
      effects of probiotics have implications for the treatment of several
      gastrointestinal diseases including antibiotic-associated colitis, acute
      gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

TI  - Measuring irritable bowel syndrome patient-reported outcomes with an abdominal
      pain numeric rating scale.
PG  - 1159-70
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04144.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists on how to measure patient-reported outcomes in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) clinical trials effectively. Pain numeric rating
      scales (NRS) are widely used in the non-IBS pain literature. The Food and Drug
      Administration has proposed using the NRS in IBS. AIM: To test the psychometrics 
      of an abdominal pain NRS in IBS. Methods We analysed data from a longitudinal
      cohort of Rome III IBS subjects. At entry, subjects completed a 10-point NRS,
      bowel symptoms, IBS severity measurements (IBS-SSS, FBDSI), health-related
      quality of life indices (IBS-QOL, EQ5D), and the Worker Productivity Activity
      Index (WPAI). We repeated assessments at 3 months along with a response scale to 
      calculate the minimal clinically important difference. RESULTS: There were 277
      subjects (82% women; age = 42 +/- 15) at baseline and 90 at 3 months. The NRS
      correlated cross-sectionally with IBS-SSS (r = 0.60; P < 0.0011), FBDSI (r =
      0.49; P < 0.0001), IBS-QOL (r = 0.43; P < 0.0001), EQ5D (r = 0.48; P < 0.0001),
      presenteeism (r = 0.39; P < 0.0001), absenteeism (r = 0.17; P = 0.04) and
      distension (r = 0.46; P < 0.0001), but not stool frequency or form. The minimal
      clinically important difference was 2.2 points, correlating with a 29.5%
      reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: An abdominal pain NRS exhibits excellent
      validity and can be readily interpreted with a minimal clinically important
      difference in patients with IBS. These data support the use of the NRS in IBS
      clinical trials.

      transporter function and expression.
PG  - 2074-83
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.09.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Serotonin transporter (SERT) plays a critical role in
      regulating serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) availability in the gut.
      Elevated 5-HT levels are associated with diarrheal conditions such as irritable
      bowel syndrome and enteric infections. Whether alteration in SERT activity
      contributes to the pathophysiology of diarrhea induced by the food-borne pathogen
      enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is not known. The present studies
      examined the effects of EPEC infection on SERT activity and expression in
      intestinal epithelial cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS:
      Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelia and EPEC-infected C57BL/6J 
      mouse model of infection were utilized. SERT activity was measured as Na(+) and
      Cl(-) dependent (3)[H] 5-HT uptake. SERT expression was measured by real-time
      quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting,
      and immunofluorescence studies. RESULTS: Infection of Caco-2 cells with EPEC for 
      30-120 minutes decreased apical SERT activity (P < .001) in a type 3 secretion
      system dependent manner and via involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases.
      EPEC infection decreased V(max) of the transporter; whereas cell surface
      biotinylation studies revealed no alteration in the cellular or plasma membrane
      content of SERT in Caco-2 cells. EPEC infection of mice (24 hours) reduced SERT
      immunostaining with a corresponding decrease in SERT messenger RNA levels, 5-HT
      uptake, and mucosal 5-HT content in the small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      demonstrate inhibition of SERT by EPEC and define the mechanisms underlying these
      effects. These data may aid in the development of a novel pharmacotherapy to
      modulate the serotonergic system in treatment of infectious diarrheal diseases.

      correction) using a MicroLyzer Model SC (QuinTron Instrument Company, Milwaukee, 
      WI). Questionnaires were used to assess Rome III IBS criteria, compliance with
      carbohydrate dietary modifications, and changes in symptoms. RESULTS: One hundred
      and twenty-one of the 181 (67%) study subjects were able to be contacted 8 months
      to 4 years after carbohydrate testing. LM (21) and FM (2) were seen in 33% of the
      66 IBS subjects. LM (12) and FM (9) were seen in 33% of the 55 subjects without
      IBS. Seventy-seven percent of IBS and 72% of those without IBS reported
      compliance with dietary advice. Of the subjects who reported compliance, 47% of
      IBS and 77% of those without IBS reported that, after identifying LM or FM, their
      symptoms resolved or improved. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate maldigestion has a
      similar incidence in patients with and without IBS and both populations have
      similar compliance with therapeutic diets. However, patients without IBS are more
      likely to have improvement in symptoms when dietary changes are instituted when
      compared to IBS patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional illness associated with
      significant impairment in quality of life. Compared to men, women are more likely
      to meet criteria for IBS, to seek treatment, and experience greater detriments in
      quality of life. In addition to physiological factors, psychosocial factors may
      contribute to such gender differences. We examined whether traits associated with
      masculine (agentic) and feminine (communal) gender roles were linked with
      adjustment to IBS. METHODS: Women with IBS (N = 144) completed online self-report
      measures of gender-related traits (agency, communion, unmitigated agency,
      unmitigated communion, lack of agency, lack of communion), IBS-specific quality
      of life (IBS-QOL), and psychological adjustment (negative and positive affect).
      RESULTS: Agency was positively associated with all dimensions of IBS-QOL and
      psychological adjustment. Select dimensions of IBS-QOL were lower among women
      higher in unmitigated agency (social reactions, body image) or unmitigated
      communion (interference with activity), and both traits were associated with
      increased negative affect. Lack of agency was associated with increased IBS-QOL
      (food avoidance) and decreased positive affect. Communion and lack of communion
      were not associated with either IBS-QOL or psychological adjustment. CONCLUSIONS:
      Findings may help elucidate psychosocial factors contributing to quality of life 
      among women with IBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of increasing the dietary content of
      soluble fibre (psyllium) or insoluble fibre (bran) in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practice.
      PARTICIPANTS: 275 patients aged 18-65 years with irritable bowel syndrome.
      INTERVENTIONS: 12 weeks of treatment with 10 g psyllium (n=85), 10 g bran (n=97),
      or 10 g placebo (rice flour) (n=93). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point
      was adequate symptom relief during at least two weeks in the previous month,
      analysed after one, two, and three months of treatment to assess both short term 
      and sustained effectiveness. Secondary end points included irritable bowel
      syndrome symptom severity score, severity of abdominal pain, and irritable bowel 
      syndrome quality of life scale. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was
      significantly greater in the psyllium group than in the placebo group during the 
      first month (57% v 35%; relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.26)
      and the second month of treatment (59% v 41%; 1.44, 1.02 to 2.06). Bran was more 
      effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% v 32%; 1.70,
      1.12 to 2.57), but this was not statistically significant in the worst case
      analysis (1.45, 0.97 to 2.16). After three months of treatment, symptom severity 
      in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points, compared with 49 points in the
      placebo group (P=0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P=0.61 versus placebo).
      No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Fifty four (64%) of
      the patients allocated to psyllium, 54 (56%) in the bran group, and 56 (60%) in
      the placebo group completed the three month treatment period. Early dropout was
      most common in the bran group; the main reason was that the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium offers benefits in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials
      NCT00189033.

TI  - Anisakis pegreffi etiological agent of gastric infections in two Italian women.
PG  - 1157-9
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2009.0325 [doi]
AB  - Two cases of gastric anisakiasis have been documented in two Italian women who
      had consumed raw anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus). The first patient was a
      49-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and bloody vomiting after
      ingestion of marinated (vinegar) raw anchovies. During the
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) a white color worm was detected and extracted
      from cardia by means of biopsy forceps. The second patient was a 59-year-old
      woman with irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, who underwent to periodical
      EGDSs. In the course of the last EGDS, a white color round worm on antrum and a
      small polyp on the fundus of the stomach were observed. The two nematodes have
      been identified as L3 larvae of the genus Anisakis by a light microscope, and as 
      Anisakis pegreffi by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
      polymorphism. The molecular identification of the etiological agent at the
      species level allows to identify what Anisakidae species play a zoonotic role and
      which are the fish host species.

TI  - Pathogenesis and management of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 19-25
AB  - The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not known. Multiple factors,
      like genetic, gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors and
      immune-mediated factors, are thought to contribute to the symptom complex of IBS.
      Till date an 'IBS gene' has not been defined, and there is a need for further
      studies. The concept that IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion is not acceptable any
      more. The treatment of IBS is targeted at the management of constipation,
      diarrhoea and abdominal pain and includes pharmacotherapy with tegaserod,
      alosetron and lubiprostone. Cognitive behavioral therapy is very beneficial.

TI  - Lack of association of tegaserod with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a
      matched case-control study.
PG  - 170-5
LID - 10.1177/1074248409340158 [doi]
AB  - Tegaserod is a first-in class selective serotonin 4 receptor agonist approved for
      the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. In March 2007, the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) suspended its use citing increased cardiovascular (CV)
      events in clinical trials. However, there is no known mechanistic basis for an
      adverse CV effect. To reassess the CV safety of tegaserod, teagaserod-treated
      patients (pts) in the Intermountain Healthcare database were identified (n =
      2603), matched 1:6 with untreated (n = 15,618) patients by age, sex, and date of 
      tegaserod initiation, and followed for an average of 2.5 years. Age averaged 38.6
      +/- 13.5 years, and 94% were female. Cardiovascular event rates were low and
      similar in patients treated with tegaserod and matched untreated patients. For
      the primary composite CV endpoint, 54 (0.35%) untreated and 12 (0.46%) treated
      pts had an event (treated OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.68-2.38, P =.46), with 7 and 0
      events, respectively, occurring within 3 months. A total of 12 (0.1%) untreated
      and 1 (<0.1%) treated pts were hospitalized for a myocardial infarction (MI). 36 
      (0.2%) untreated and 10 (0.4%) treated pts for a cardiovascular accident, and 1
      pt in each group for unstable angina. A total of 6 (<0.1%) untreated and no
      treated pts died from cardiac causes. Event rates were comparable to expected
      rates in this population of mostly premenopausal women. This large epidemiologic 
      study failed to confirm a reported large event differential for tegaserod that
      was noted incidentally in a clinical trials database, suggesting that the prior
      observation may have been due to chance.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a mild disorder; purely symptomatic treatment.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - (1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders,
      associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an
      underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious
      disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, 
      unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also
      present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course 
      of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on
      abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials.
      Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and
      only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do
      not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to 
      have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse
      effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor
      has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
      (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of
      potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative
      risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well
      as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic 
      laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation 
      can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly
      assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It
      modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; 
      (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients
      are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel
      syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9)
      Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances
      have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and
      psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral
      products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of
      intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with
      inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six
      available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a
      placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel
      syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment
      should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful
      physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available 
      treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best 
      to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry
      a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.

TI  - The role of diet in symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in adults: a narrative
      review.
PG  - 1204-14
LID - 10.1016/j.jada.2009.04.012 [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes what is known about the effect of diet on irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms emphasizing data from randomized, controlled clinical
      trials. Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be
      caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate 
      that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including
      fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar
      alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long
      history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may 
      worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will
      improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been
      adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS
      symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture 
      yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, 
      it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an
      adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the
      most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified
      exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating
      classes of food may be useful.

TI  - Sex differences in dietary coping with gastrointestinal symptoms.
PG  - 327-33
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e32832b9c53 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Nutritional changes are often considered first-line treatment in public
      health diseases that apply to many gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, as different 
      food and beverages may modulate GI motor and sensory functions, and may provoke
      GI symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine dietary coping and possible
      changes in food and beverage intake in relation to GI symptoms reported by
      identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients compared with healthy
      controls, and whether any sex differences were observed in these respects.
      METHODS: A population-based case-control design was used. Three primary
      healthcare centres were selected in the city of Linkoping in Sweden. The IBS
      patients were recruited from the studied primary healthcare centers on the basis 
      of diagnoses from computerized medical records. The controls were randomly
      selected from the general population in the same region. A questionnaire was used
      with specific questions about self-reported food and beverage increase or
      decrease of GI symptoms and self-reported changes in dietary habits. RESULTS:
      Female IBS patients seem to be more willing to change dietary habits because of
      their GI problems than men. Effects of these nutritional behaviour changes were
      reported for almost all participants that had made dietary adjustments. Fatty
      food, certain vegetables, dairy products and eggs were significantly more
      reported to cause GI complaints among IBS patients compared with their controls. 
      CONCLUSION: Female IBS patients reported more changes in their dietary habits
      because of GI problems than men with the disease. The majority of both women and 
      men who changed their dietary habits because of GI problems experienced
      improvement in their symptoms.

      Rome III diagnostic criteria in a general population in Colombia].
PG  - 395-400
LID - 10.1016/j.gastrohep.2009.01.177 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal
      disorder with a clinical diagnosis. The prevalence of this disorder and
      associated factors are unknown among the Colombian population. Nowadays,
      diagnosis of IBS is made by applying the Rome III criteria, and other disorders
      should be excluded before establishing the diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      prevalence of IBS and associated factors in a population aged between 18 and 60
      years old in Bucaramanga, Colombia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was
      performed. We applied a questionnaire that included sociodemographic variables,
      types of food, identification of IBS by the Rome III criteria, the Zung
      self-rating depression scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and
      self-reported use of medical services among a random sample of an adult
      population in Bucaramanga. Univariate analysis and logistic regression was used
      to establish associations. RESULTS: Of the 615 individuals selected, 558 were
      included in the study. The mean age was 36.4 years and 62.4% was female. The
      prevalence of IBS was 19.9%. Logistic regression analysis showed an association
      with depressive symptoms and female sex independently of age and anxiety
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS is high and is associated with
      depressive symptoms and female sex in an adult population in Colombia. This
      disorder generates substantial health system utilization and medical disability
      and restricts activities of daily life.

AB  - Motility and functional disorders of the small intestine, the colon and the
      anorectum can induce or contribute to symptoms such as diarrhoea, constipation
      and abdominal pain and may impair nutrient absorption in severe cases. Acute
      affections of intestinal functions e.g. during gastrointestinal infections
      usually need no functional diagnostics but resolve spontaneously or with adequate
      therapy of the underlying disease. By contrast, chronic disturbances of small
      intestinal, colonic and anorectal motility and/or sensitivity are subject to
      gastrointestinal function tests. The role of these tests for diagnosis and
      therapeutic handling of severe intestinal dysmotility/chronic intestinal
      pseudo-obstruction, severe constipation, diarrhoea, fecal incontinence and
      irritable bowel syndrome will be discussed in this review that mainly focuses on 
      adults.

TI  - Prophylactic role of maternal administration of probiotics in the prevention of
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 764-7
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.04.023 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal stress is a common early life event which alters the development of the 
      endocrine and immune systems. Specifically, exposure to neonatal stress results
      in alterations to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in
      offspring who hyper-respond to stress in adulthood. Recently, this concept has
      been applied to the ontogeny of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances
      such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The high prevalence of this disorder and 
      the ineffectiveness of current treatments results in high direct and indirect
      costs to the society. Recently, administration of probiotics to neonates has been
      used as a safe and cost-effective preventative strategy to revoke the long term
      unfavourable imprinting induced on the gastrointestinal system by early life
      stressors in animal models of human IBS. It is not as yet known however, whether 
      maternal supplementary probiotics may also contribute to improved GI integrity
      and gut-associated immune functioning in stressed neonates, if these possible
      improvements persist into adulthood, or how this protective effect may be
      mediated. Our hypothesis is an attempt to link this proposed nutritional approach
      and its possible preventive effects against GI dysfunctions provoked by neonatal 
      stress.

TI  - Targeting the human microbiome with antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics:
      gastroenterology enters the metagenomics era.
PG  - 2015-31
AB  - Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our
      knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our
      understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is
      refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of
      human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions.
      Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity,
      relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of
      nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the
      composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of
      gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the
      gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics,
      probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress
      undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing 
      microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host.
      Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to
      maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these
      approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific
      disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies
      to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
      colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.

AB  - In contrast to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the prevalence and risk factors
      for diarrhoea in the absence of IBS in the community are unknown. We aimed to
      evaluate potential risk factors for chronic diarrhoea (non-IBS). A valid
      questionnaire that recorded gastrointestinal symptoms required for a diagnosis of
      chronic diarrhoea, self-reported measures of potential risk factors, and a
      somatic symptom checklist was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random
      sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents (30-64 year). Chronic diarrhoea was
      defined as reporting one or more of the following symptoms more than 25% of the
      time in the past 3 months: > or =3 bowel movements a day, loose or watery stools,
      or faecal urgency. Subjects with IBS (Rome III) were excluded. Of 892 eligible
      subjects, 653 (73%) responded. Among 523 respondents not reporting IBS, chronic
      diarrhoea was reported by 148 (28%); 90 (61%) had chronic painless diarrhoea.
      Chronic diarrhoea was significantly associated with self-reported food
      sensitivity (OR = 2.05 [1.31-3.20]) and stress (OR = 1.99 [1.03-3.85]). Both
      remained significant in the adjusted variable models that excluded subjects with 
      any abdominal pain. Female gender (OR = 0.67 [0.45-0.98]) and higher education
      level (OR = 0.60 [0.39-0.92]) had smaller odds for chronic diarrhoea. No
      association was detected for age, marital status, body mass index, cigarette or
      alcohol use, coffee, analgesics, emotional support, pets or water source. Chronic
      diarrhoea in the absence of IBS is common; self-reported food sensitivity, male
      gender and a lower level of education are risk factors.

PG  - 40-7
AB  - Probiotics are defined viable microorganisms which in sufficient amount reach the
      intestine in an active state, to be able to exert positive health benefit on the 
      host. Thus far, they have shown particular promise on prevention or treatment of 
      various pathologic conditions. Our aim has been to report the most recent
      articles (until October 2008), resulting from randomized, double controlled
      trials, according to the conventional and molecular methods. In this review we
      have taken into consideration almost all the fields in which the probiotics have 
      been given, either with a prophylactic or therapeutic intent. So far we have
      summarized the actual results concerning lactose intolerance, acute rotavirus
      diarrhea, traveller's diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, Clostridium
      difficile infection, and the role as adjuvant in Helicobacter pylori eradication.
      Furthermore, we have synthesised articles concerning the probiotic connection in 
      irritable bowel syndrome, and in inflammatory bowel diseases. Last but not least,
      the prevention by probiotics of allergic diseases, of bacterial vaginosis, of
      respiratory infections, and the possible advantage in hypercholesteremic
      subjects.

AB  - A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various
      probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters,
      infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of
      the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and
      mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by 
      some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation,
      the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear 
      less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of
      diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition.
      Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults,
      but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious
      outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are
      less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic
      supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk
      and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early
      supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from
      studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans
      is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects
      seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of
      probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the
      subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements 
      were made.

TI  - Use of probiotics in the management of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: a case
      study.
PG  - 569-70
LID - 10.1177/0148607109332004 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in
      response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral
      chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining.
      Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have
      gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief
      communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer
      patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a
      multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated
      with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies
      combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and
      Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study
      demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different
      probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of
      study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that
      probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.

LID - 10.1556/OH.2009.28604 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are preparations containing viable microorganisms that confer
      potential health benefits for the host. Alteration of bacterial flora both in
      terms of specific content and concentration may be beneficial in many
      gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are widely used for the management of
      these conditions in many countries. However, mechanisms of probiotics are
      incompletely understood. Benefits observed clinically with one species or
      combinations of species can not be generalized. The optimal dose of treatment has
      to be determined. Although probiotics are generally regarded safe, caution is
      needed when using these supplements routinely. It has been proved, that severe
      adverse events can occur as a complication of probiotic treatment. This review
      summarizes the recent knowledge concerning the use of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  - Medicinal chemistry and therapeutic potential of muscarinic M3 antagonists.
PG  - 867-902
LID - 10.1002/med.20158 [doi]
AB  - Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptors
      family. Currently five different receptor subtypes have been identified and
      cloned. M3 receptor subtypes are coupled to G(q) family proteins and increase
      phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and calcium release from internal stores. They
      are widely distributed both in the central nervous system and in the periphery.
      At the central level, M3 receptor subtypes are involved in modulation of
      neurotransmitter release, temperature homeostasis, and food intake, while in the 
      periphery they induce smooth muscle contraction, gland secretion, indirect
      relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and miosis. The main therapeutic
      applications of M3 antagonists include overactive bladder (OAB), chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pain-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). The introduction of selective M3 antagonists has not improved
      clinical efficacy compared with the old non-selective antimuscarinics but has
      reduced the rate of adverse events mediated by the blockade of cardiac M2
      receptors (tachycardia) and central M1 receptors (cognitive impairment). Improved
      tolerability has been obtained also with controlled release or with inhaled
      formulations. However, there is still a need for safer M3 antagonists for the
      treatment of COPD and better-tolerated and more effective compounds for the
      therapy of OAB. New selective muscarinic M3 antagonists currently in early
      discovery and under development have been designed to address these issues.
      However, as M3 receptors are widely located in various tissues including salivary
      glands, gut smooth muscles, iris, and ciliary muscles, further clinical
      improvements may derive from the discovery and the development of new compounds
      with tissue rather than muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity.

TI  - [Determination of milk and diary products consumption and their connection with
      lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in selected disorders of the
      alimentary tract in children].
PG  - 110-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: Lactose stimulates proliferation and colonization of acidophilic
      bacteria, which due to fermentation processes lower colonic pH and simplified
      absorption of some microelements from the intestine. However, the common problem 
      in children is intolerance of this carbohydrate. Treatment, quite simple, is
      based on partial or total elimination of lactose from diet. Some substitutional
      products with equivalent nutritional value should be introduced to prevent
      deficiencies symptoms during lactose-free diet. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY:
      Determination of milk and dairy products consumption and their connection with
      lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in children above 5 years of age in 
      selected disorders of the alimentary tract: food allergy, celiac disease,
      secondary enteropathy, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and
      deficiency of body weight and height. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of 301
      patients above 5 years of age (135 boys and 166 girls; mean age 11.5 years) were 
      included into the study. Milk and dairy products consumption habits, lactose
      intolerance symptoms, hydrogen breath test, activity of lactase and villous
      atrophy were investigated. RESULTS: Decreased sweet milk consumption from, 33.33%
      in children with food allergy to 55.38% in children with functional indigestion
      was observed, in spite of gastrointestinal complaints after ingestion of milk.
      The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance frequency was observed 
      in children with decreased sweet milk consumption due to complaints after
      ingestion of milk and in children who didn't drink milk. There were no
      statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption
      and lactose intolerance symptoms in children with different dairy products
      consumption habits. There were no statistically significant difference between
      frequency of hypolactasia in children with different sweet milk or dairy products
      consumption habits. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent (33-55%) decreased sweet milk
      consumption in children in spite of clinical symptoms after ingestion of milk was
      observed. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms
      frequency was observed in children who didn't drink milk and in children with
      decreased consumption of sweet milk due to complaints after ingestion of milk.
      There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose
      malabsorption and lactose intolerance in children with different dairy products
      consumption habits.

TI  - Development of functional gastrointestinal disorders after Giardia lamblia
      infection.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-9-27 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) may occur following
      acute gastroenteritis. This long-term complication has previously not been
      described after infection with the non-invasive protozoan Giardia lamblia. This
      study aims to characterize persistent abdominal symptoms elicited by Giardia
      infection according to Rome II criteria and symptoms scores. METHODS: Structured 
      interview and questionnaires 12-30 months after the onset of Giardia infection,
      and at least 6 months after Giardia eradication, among 82 patients with
      persisting abdominal symptoms elicited by the Giardia infection. All had been
      evaluated to exclude other causes. RESULTS: We found that 66 (80.5%) of the 82
      patients had symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 17
      (24.3%) patients had functional dyspepsia (FD) according to Rome II criteria. IBS
      was sub classified into D-IBS (47.0%), A-IBS (45.5%) and C-IBS (7.6%). Bloating, 
      diarrhoea and abdominal pain were reported to be most severe. Symptoms
      exacerbation related to specific foods were reported by 45 (57.7%) patients and
      to physical or mental stress by 34 (44.7%) patients. CONCLUSION: In the presence 
      of an IBS-subtype pattern consistent with post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS), and in
      the absence of any other plausible causes, we conclude that acute Giardia
      infection may elicit functional gastrointestinal diseases with food and stress
      related symptoms similar to FGID patients in general.

TI  - Bifidobacterium infantis 35624: a novel probiotic for the treatment of irritable 
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 7-15
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder with widespread prevalence.
      Due to its heterogeneous pathogenesis, efficacious treatments are lacking. The
      few medications that are effective for treating global IBS symptoms have either
      been withdrawn or restricted due to detrimental side effects; thus, safe and
      effective alternatives are urgently needed. Increasing data have revealed that
      inflammatory changes may play a role in the development of IBS, and probiotics,
      commensal organisms with inherent health benefits, may alter that milieu.
      Although their exact mechanisms of action remain elusive, it is clear that the
      beneficial properties inherent to each probiotic species are strain specific.
      Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 ( B infantis 35624; Bifantis, The Procter & Gamble
      Company, Cincinnati, OH), is a probiotic with unique abilities to reduce
      intestinal inflammation. Two randomized, controlled trials have validated its
      efficacy for treating both individual and global IBS symptoms without evidence to
      suggest an increase in adverse events. B. infantis 35624 appears safe and
      effective for the treatment of IBS.

TI  - [Food allergy, food intolerance or functional disorder?].
PG  - 375-87
LID - 10.1024/1661-8157.98.7.375 [doi]
AB  - The term "food allergy" is widely misused for all sorts of symptoms and diseases 
      caused by food. Food allergy (FA) is an adverse reaction to food (food
      hypersensitivity) occurring in susceptible individuals, which is mediated by a
      classical immune mechanism specific for the food itself. The best established
      mechanism in FA is due to the presence of IgE antibodies against the offending
      food. Food intolerance (FI) are all non-immune-mediated adverse reactions to
      food. The subgroups of FI are enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase 
      deficiency), pharmacological (reactions against biogenic amines, histamine
      intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives). 
      The diagnosis of an IgE-mediated FA is made by a carefully taken case history,
      supported by the demonstration of an IgE sensitization either by skin prick tests
      or by in vitro tests, and confirmed by positive oral provocation. For scientific 
      purposes the only accepted test for the confirmation of FA/FI is a properly
      performed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). A panel of
      recombinant allergens, produced as single allergenic molecules, may in future
      improve the diagnosis of IgE-mediated FA. Due to a lack of causal treatment
      possibilities, the elimination of the culprit "food allergen" from the diet is
      the only therapeutic option for patients with real food allergy.

TI  - A focus group assessment of patient perspectives on irritable bowel syndrome and 
      illness severity.
PG  - 1532-41
LID - 10.1007/s10620-009-0792-6 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing need to understand from the patient's perspective the
      experience of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the factors contributing to its 
      severity; this has been endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
      Accordingly, we conducted focus groups to address this issue. A total of 32
      patients with mostly moderate to severe IBS were recruited through advertising
      and were allocated into three focus groups based on predominant stool pattern.
      The focus groups were held using standard methodology to obtain a general
      assessment of the symptoms experienced with IBS, its impact, and of factors
      associated with self-perceived severity. Patients described IBS not only as
      symptoms (predominantly abdominal pain) but mainly as it affects daily function, 
      thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Common responses included uncertainty and
      unpredictability with loss of freedom, spontaneity and social contacts, as well
      as feelings of fearfulness, shame, and embarrassment. This could lead to
      behavioral responses including avoidance of activities and many adaptations in
      routine in an effort for patients to gain control. A predominant theme was a
      sense of stigma experienced because of a lack of understanding by family, friends
      and physicians of the effects of IBS on the individual, or the legitimacy of the 
      individual's emotions and adaptation behaviors experienced. This was a barrier to
      normal functioning that could be ameliorated through identifying with others who 
      could understand this situation. Severity was linked to health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) and was influenced by the intensity of abdominal pain and other
      symptoms, interference with and restrictions relating to eating, work, and social
      activities, and of the unpredictability of the condition. This study confirms the
      heterogeneous and multi-component nature of IBS. These qualitative data can be
      used in developing health status and severity instruments for larger-scale
      studies.

TI  - Bacillus coagulans significantly improved abdominal pain and bloating in patients
      with IBS.
PG  - 119-24
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2009.03.1984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can have a profound impact
      on emotional health and quality of life, and current treatments are sometimes
      unsatisfactory for patients facing this lifelong disease. Probiotics, which can
      normalize gastrointestinal microflora, may alleviate symptoms of IBS. OBJECTIVE: 
      This preliminary controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the
      probiotic Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 on IBS symptoms. METHODS: This was a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      involving 44 subjects who received either placebo or B coagulans GBI-30, 6086
      once a day for 8 weeks. Self-assessments of the severity of IBS symptoms
      (abdominal pain and bloating) were recorded every day for 8 weeks. Because
      baseline values were significantly different between the 2 study groups,
      within-group analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Improvements from baseline
      abdominal pain and bloating scores in the B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 group were
      statistically significant for all 7 weekly comparisons (P < 0.01). In the placebo
      group, only changes in abdominal pain scores at weeks 6 and 8 achieved
      statistical significance (P < 0.05). No treatment-related adverse events or
      serious adverse events were reported during the 8-week study period. CONCLUSIONS:
      Preliminary data suggest that the patented B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic may
      be a safe and effective option for the relief of abdominal pain and bloating for 
      patients with IBS. Larger, extended trials are needed to verify these results.

AB  - Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.
      Although there is evidence that gastrointestinal flora is important in gut
      motility, there is little evidence that gut flora is abnormal in constipation.
      Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increase stool frequency and decrease consistency
      in normal individuals. But, according to several reviews, the evidence of
      probiotics for efficacy in constipation is limited. Fiber supplements,
      lactose-free diets, and lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the
      management of children with recurrent abdominal pain and irritable bowel
      syndrome. Several studies with Lactobacillus GG in children showed negative
      results in children with chronic constipation. Because Bifidobacterium animalis
      DN-173 010 has been shown to be effective in adults with constipation-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome this study should also be performed in a well-designed
      large placebo-controlled trial in children with constipation.

AB  - Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), frequently associated with psychological
      distress, is characterized by hypersensitivity to gut wall distension. Some
      probiotics are able to alleviate IBS symptoms and reduce visceromotor response to
      mechanical stimuli in animals. Moreover, we have previously shown that
      Lactobacillus farciminis treatment abolished the hyperalgesia to colorectal
      distension (CRD) induced by acute stress. The aims of the present study were to
      determine whether (i) stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia modifies the
      expression of Fos, a marker of general neuronal activation, induced by CRD, (ii) 
      this activation can be modulated by L. farciminis treatment. Female rats were
      treated by L. farciminis and CRD was performed after partial restraint stress
      (PRS) or sham-PRS. The expression of Fos protein was measured by
      immunohistochemistry. After CRD or PRS, Fos expression was increased in spinal
      cord section (S1), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), paraventricular nucleus
      (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA). The
      combination of both stimuli, PRS and CRD, markedly increased this Fos
      overexpression in the sacral spinal cord section, PVN and MeA, but not in NTS. By
      contrast, a pretreatment with L. farciminis significantly reduced the number of
      Fos positive cells in these area. This study shows that PRS enhances Fos protein 
      expression induced by CRD at the spinal and supraspinal levels in rats.
      Lactobacillus farciminis treatment inhibited this enhancing effect, suggesting
      that the antinociceptive effect of this probiotic strain results from a decrease 
      of the stress-induced activation/sensitization of sensory neurons at the spinal
      and supraspinal level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frustrating symptom affecting 3% of children
      worldwide. Randomised controlled trials show that both polyethylene glycol and
      lactulose are effective in increasing defecation frequency in children with
      constipation. However, in 30-50%, these children reported abdominal pain,
      bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea and bad taste of the medication. Two
      recent studies have shown that the fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis strain DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool
      frequency in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients with a
      defecation frequency < 3/week and in constipated women with a defecation
      frequency < 3/week. Goal of this study is to determine whether this fermented
      dairy product is effective in the treatment of constipated children with a
      defecation frequency < 3/week. METHODS/DESIGN: It is a two nation (The
      Netherlands and Poland) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised multicentre
      trial in which 160 constipated children (age 3-16 years) with a defecation
      frequency <3/week will be randomly allocated to consume a fermented dairy product
      containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 or a control product, twice a day,
      for 3 weeks. During the study all children are instructed to try to defecate on
      the toilet for 5-10 minutes after each meal (3 times a day) and daily complete a 
      standardized bowel diary. Primary endpoint is stool frequency. Secondary
      endpoints are stool consistency, faecal incontinence frequency, pain during
      defecation, digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, flatulence), adverse effects
      (nausea, diarrhoea, bad taste) and intake of rescue medication (Bisacodyl). Rate 
      of success and rate of responders are also evaluated, with success defined as >
      or = 3 bowel movements per week and < or =1 faecal incontinence episode over the 
      last 2 weeks of product consumption and responder defined as a subject reporting 
      a stool frequency > or = 3 on the last week of product consumption. To
      demonstrate that the success percentage in the intervention group will be 35% and
      the success percentage in the control group (acidified milk without ferments,
      toilet training, bowel diary) will be 15%, with alpha 0.05 and power 80%, a total
      sample size of 160 patients was calculated. CONCLUSION: This study is aimed to
      show that the fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis strain
      DN-173 010 is effective in increasing stool frequency after 3 weeks of product
      consumption in children with functional constipation and a defecation frequency <
      3/week.

TI  - The utility of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 1033-49; quiz 1050
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.25 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder and available
      therapies have limited efficacy. Mucosal inflammation and alterations in gut
      microflora may contribute to the development of IBS symptoms, and researchers
      have hypothesized that probiotics might improve these symptoms. The aim of this
      study was to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of probiotics in the treatment 
      of IBS. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches of multiple databases were
      performed. Study selection criteria were as follows: (i) RCTs, (ii) adults with
      IBS defined by Manning or Rome II criteria, (iii) single or combination probiotic
      vs. placebo, and (iv) improvement in IBS symptoms and/or decrease in frequency of
      adverse events reported. Data about study design and results were extracted in
      duplicate using standardized data extraction forms. Owing to variability in
      outcome measures, quantitative pooling of data was not feasible. RESULTS: A total
      of 16 RCTs met selection criteria. Of those, 11 studies showed suboptimal study
      design with inadequate blinding, inadequate trial length, inadequate sample size,
      and/or lack of intention-to-treat analysis. None of the studies provided
      quantifiable data about both tolerability and adverse events. Bifidobacterium
      infantis 35624 showed significant improvement in the composite score for
      abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and/or bowel movement difficulty 
      compared with placebo (P<0.05) in two appropriately designed studies. No other
      probiotic showed significant improvement in IBS symptoms in an appropriately
      designed study. CONCLUSIONS: B. infantis 35624 has shown efficacy for improvement
      of IBS symptoms. Most RCTs about the utility of probiotics in IBS have not used
      an appropriate study design and do not adequately report adverse events.
      Therefore, there is inadequate data to comment on the efficacy of other
      probiotics. Future probiotic studies should follow Rome II recommendations for
      appropriate design of an RCT.

AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms that produce a benefit to the host when
      provided in adequate amounts from food or supplements. There is an increased
      interest in the use of probiotics in the management and treatment of complex
      medical conditions. Recommendations for probiotic supplementation in the
      pediatric population are often conflicting due to limited research in many
      pediatric disease states. Research on single and multistrain probiotics has shown
      promise for some pediatric populations. This review discusses the research
      available for probiotic supplementation for children with irritable bowel
      syndrome, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency
      virus, and food allergies. Probiotic safety also is discussed.

AB  - Diverticular disease is one of the most common medical conditions affecting
      Western populations. Inflammatory complications are the most common manifestation
      of the disease and typically cause acute bouts of abdominal pain and fever.
      Chronic symptoms can also occur and can be mistakenly attributed to irritable
      bowel syndrome and rarely to inflammatory bowel disease. Alterations in
      peridiverticular bacterial flora are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis
      of diverticular inflammation. This article discusses the rationale and reviews
      the existing clinical data regarding the role of probiotics in the management of 
      diverticular disease.

AB  - Among the numerous positive effects of probiotic microorganisms and prebiotic
      carbohydrates observed in clinical studies--the majority of which, however, does 
      not fulfil the criteria of pharmaceutical verification--some are of specific
      relevance to female health. The present review addresses--besides some notes
      concerning the potential microbiota-hormone interactions--the first line with
      preventive and/or therapeutic applications of probiotic bacteria in order to
      maintain a balanced intestinal and urogenital flora, as well as in the case of
      irritable bowel syndrome, constipation (idiopathic slow-transit) and urogenital
      tract infections. Further aspects are the promotion of bone health and
      osteoporosis prevention brought about by inulin, oligofructose and
      galactooligosaccharides. Some further conditions, namely anorexia nervosa, the
      premenstrual syndrome as well as prevention or alleviation of climacteric and
      menopausal disorders, for which the use of probiotics is rather hypothetical or
      is largely studied by alternative medicine practising physicians, are addressed
      briefly.

AB  - AIM: Some probiotics improve digestive comfort of people with Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome, but this needs confirmation in a healthy population. The objective of
      this pilot study was to investigate the effect of consuming fermented milk
      containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 and yoghourt strains
      (test product) on digestive comfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed
      gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: The study was designed to approximate a
      real-life situation, by using a branded product in the intervention groups. In an
      open-label, randomized, controlled trial, 371 adults reporting digestive
      discomfort were randomized into three groups who had a daily consumption of
      either one or two pots of test product over 2 weeks, or to follow their usual
      diet. Digestive comfort and bother from digestive symptoms were assessed by
      questionnaire at baseline and follow-up (per protocol population n = 360).
      Self-reported change in digestive comfort and computed change between baseline
      and follow-up for each of 20 items were compared between groups
      (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). RESULTS: A higher percentage of participants
      consuming the test product reported improved digestive comfort (1-pot group
      82.5%; 2-pot group 84.3%), than controls (2.9%). Their self-reported change
      scores differed significantly (P < 0.001). For both test product groups, almost
      all symptom scores improved significantly more than controls (P < 0.001). There
      were no significant differences between 1-pot and 2-pot groups. CONCLUSIONS: This
      pilot study shows that daily consumption of a probiotic food in real-life
      conditions may be useful in improving digestive comfort and symptom experience of
      adults from general population. Further double-blind randomized controlled
      studies are required to confirm these health benefits.

AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a low grade immune
      activation. However, little is known about the properties of B cells of IBS
      patients. We therefore investigated activation level and antigen presenting
      phenotype of blood B cells of IBS patients. We also examined B-cell responses to 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and probiotic bacteria. Blood samples were obtained from
      74 IBS patients and 30 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 
      isolated and stimulated with LPS or an UV-light inactivated bacterial cocktail
      consisting of the probiotic Gram-positive strains; Lactobacillus paracasei ssp.
      paracasei 19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis B612. The
      phenotype of CD19(+) B cells was investigated by flow cytometry before and after 
      72 h cell culture. Furthermore, IBS symptom severity was assessed. B cells
      isolated from blood of IBS patients displayed an amplified activation level as
      demonstrated by increased cell surface expression of IgG, and also the
      costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. Expression of antigen presenting HLA-DR
      and costimulatory molecule CD40 on B cells was, however comparable in IBS
      patients and controls. B cells of IBS patients displayed an impaired ability to
      increase expression of CD80, but not CD86, in response to both LPS as well as
      probiotic bacteria stimulations. To conclude, blood B cells of IBS patients have 
      an increased activation level. Bacterial component induced expression of the
      costimulatory molecule CD80, regarded as important for tolerance induction, is
      impaired. These data suggest that B-cell antigen presentation in IBS patients is 
      associated with altered capacity of providing costimulation to T cells.

TI  - Complementary and alternative medicine for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence supporting selected complementary and
      alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January
      1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 
      2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with
      complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint
      oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic,
      hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were
      screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. 
      Level I evidence was available for most interventions. MAIN MESSAGE: Soluble
      fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates
      IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for
      IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain.
      Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic
      options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by
      limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are
      supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: Several
      complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an
      evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients
      with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.

      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-9-15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal
      disorder and the evidence for efficacy of most drug therapies in the treatment of
      IBS is weak. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several
      conditions. including IBS. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements.The aim
      of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials study was to
      evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating symptoms in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. We searched Ovid versions of MEDLINE (1950-2007),
      EMBASE (1980-2007), CINAHL (1982-2007), AMED (1985-2007), the Cochrane library
      and hand searched retrieved papers. RESULTS: We identified 14 randomized placebo 
      controlled trials. Combined data suggested a modest improvement in overall
      symptoms after several weeks of treatment: for dichotomous data from seven trials
      the overall Odds Ratio (OR) was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2); for continuous data
      from six trials the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07 to 
      0.38).For individual symptoms the results differed between the pooled dichotomous
      and pooled continuous data. Trials varied in relation to the length of treatment 
      (4-26 weeks), dose, organisms and strengths of probiotics used. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a
      condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak.
      However, as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent longer
      term trials are recommended. Such research should focus on the type, optimal dose
      of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.

PG  - 209-14
LID - 10.1055/s-2008-1027702 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapy trials with bacterial compounds in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) have produced conflicting results and, so far, an E.-coli preparation has
      not been used. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-eight patients with lower
      abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the compound
      Symbioflor-2 (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an Escherichia coli product (N
      = 148), or placebo (n = 150) in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients
      were seen weekly by the physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS
      symptoms. Both an abdominal pain score (APS) as well as a general symptom score
      (GSS) were used as primary endpoints. Responders had to have complete absence of 
      IBS core symptoms at > or = 1 visit during treatment. RESULTS: The responder rate
      in GSS to the drug was 27 / 148 (18.2 %) in comparison to placebo with 7 / 150
      (4.67 %) (p = 0.000397). The improvement in APS was 28 / 148 (18.9 %) and 10 /
      150 (6.67 %) for placebo (p = 0.001649). The response was reached from visit 3
      onwards with both medication and placebo. Post-hoc analysis revealed no
      significant differences in efficacy of the drug between the gender and different 
      age groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment of IBS with the probiotic Symbioflor-2 is
      effective and superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients
      seen by general practitioners and by gastroenterologists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn's
      Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that
      refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a
      pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to
      domestic refrigeration in childhood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a
      standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed
      by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The
      questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of home refrigerator
      and freezer. Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age
      was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and
      control groups were respectively 48.3% and 63.7%. Patients were exposed earlier
      than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator
      exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI:
      1.01-4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure 
      to freezer at home. Finally, among the other recorded items reflecting the
      hygiene and comfort at home, we also found personal television, car and washing
      machine associated with CD. CONCLUSION: This study supports the opinion that CD
      is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household
      factors, during childhood.

LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003019.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities.
      It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies 
      for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on 
      physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed 
      by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been
      recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions 
      for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The
      Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE
      (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO 
      (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and
      JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were
      employed. Researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant
      studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any
      dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a
      diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II
      criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials
      for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies
      were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were
      included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre
      supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one
      study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled
      odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.26 (0.25,
      6.29). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983)
      compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a
      form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to 
      follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three
      trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation
      with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two
      (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided
      analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% 
      CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on
      the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that
      fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are
      effective in the management of children with RAP.

TI  - The impact of probiotic on gut health.
PG  - 68-78
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota plays an important role in host
      health due to its involvement in nutritional, immunologic and physiological
      functions. Microbial imbalances have been associated with enhanced risk of
      specific diseases. This observation has allowed the introduction of
      microorganisms as probiotics which are microbes with demonstrated health benefits
      in humans when ingested in foods. The mechanisms of action include the inhibition
      of pathogen growth by competition for nutritional sources and adhesion sites,
      secretion of antimicrobial substances, toxin inactivation. Consequently, the
      primary clinical interest in the application of probiotics has been in the
      prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea diseases. The well-characterized immunomodulatory potential of specific 
      probiotic strains, beyond the effect on the composition of the microbiota, has
      been be used as innovative tools to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize 
      gut mucosal dysfunction, and down-regulate hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical
      efficacy of specific probiotic strains has been demonstrated in, rotavirus's
      diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and food
      allergies. Further, recent clinical and nutritional studies have uncovered the
      function of specific strains in energy metabolism and thereby have opened up new 
      angles on their exploitation. However, as these processes are highly specific, it
      is important to characterize the properties of specific probiotic strains an in
      order to select the best strains or strain combinations for the target in
      question. Advances have prompted increased the interest of researchers and
      industry and new applications and targets are being discovered.

TI  - Prevalence, characteristics, and impact of bloating symptoms in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 68-72; quiz 3
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2008.07.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Bloating symptoms are common in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) seen in primary care and gastrointestinal clinics. However, the
      underlying mechanisms of IBS are poorly understood, and there are few data
      available about the epidemiology of this syndrome or the impact of its symptoms. 
      We investigated the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of bloating symptoms 
      in patients with IBS. METHODS: IBS patients were identified by Rome II criteria
      in a U.S. population representative web-based survey. Patients were asked about
      the quality, frequency, and severity of their gastrointestinal symptoms. The
      impact of these symptoms was investigated by assessing patients' health-related
      quality of life, utilization of health care, and use of medications. RESULTS: Of 
      the 337 IBS patients in this study, 82.5% (n = 278) reported bloating symptoms,
      the second most bothersome symptom after abdominal cramping. The symptoms were
      more prevalent in female patients, 87.4% (n = 209), than in male patients, 70.4% 
      (n = 69) (P < .0001), and in patients with constipation, 88.7% (n = 47), and
      mixed symptoms, 88.8% (n = 135), than in patients with diarrhea, 72.3% (n = 96), 
      (P = .02 and P < .01, respectively). Bloating symptoms were the third (of 14)
      most important reason to seek medical care, and more than half of the patients
      reported regular use of anti-gas medications. Bloating symptoms were associated
      with decreased energy levels (P = .04), food intake (P < .01), and physical
      functioning (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: Bloating symptoms are common in patients with
      IBS, and their prevalence and relative severity differ on the basis of sex and
      IBS subtype. Bloating symptoms are associated with a decrease in the quality of
      life and increases in health care utilization and use of medications.

LID - 10.1159/000268121 [doi]
AB  - While recent studies have indicated that the colonic mucosa in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) shows an increase in inflammatory cells, this 'inflammation' is
      quantitatively less than in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and of a different
      nature with a predominance of mast cells, particularly in female patients.
      Inflammation can arise via numerous pathways including infection, stress, food
      allergy and changes in gut microbiota. Low-grade mucosal inflammation throughout 
      the colon and including the terminal ileum can be seen for many months after an
      attack of acute gastroenteritis and is a feature of post-infective IBS.
      Measurements of gut permeability also show a prolonged increase in both the small
      and large bowel in both post-infective IBS and IBS with diarrhoea predominance.
      This has been linked to visceral hypersensitivity, but whether this is causal or 
      an epiphenomenon remains uncertain. Studying the risk factors for post-infective 
      IBS has shown the importance of both local and microbiological factors, as well
      as psychological factors, including adverse life events, anxiety and depression. 
      Stress in both animals and humans can activate mast cells, which (by increasing
      gut permeability) may allow activation of the systemic immune system.
      Demonstration of the importance of the low-grade inflammation observed awaits
      definitive large scale trials of agents designed to specifically reverse these
      changes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic
      review was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May
      2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases
      were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW
      (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra
      information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing
      probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any
      acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in
      abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and
      data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were
      synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous
      data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random
      effects models. RESULTS: 19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were
      identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate
      methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There
      were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable.
      Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not
      improving=0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT)=4 (95%
      CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=28.3, p=0.001,
      I(2)=68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351
      patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD=-0.34;
      95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity
      (chi(2)=67.04, p<0.001, I(2)=79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial. 
      CONCLUSION: Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of
      benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy 
      of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic
      microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44
      patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel
      crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either
      3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored 
      weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal
      microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global
      assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored.
      RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 
      0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters
      monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency
      (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score
      of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly
      improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut
      bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These
      findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.

TI  - Prebiotics, immune function, infection and inflammation: a review of the
      evidence.
PG  - 633-58
LID - 10.1017/S0007114508055608 [doi]
AB  - Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through
      resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon
      intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial
      members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal
      microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial
      effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory
      processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and
      evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory
      animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and 
      the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies
      in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system
      may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of
      intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten
      trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious
      outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in 
      specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in
      animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal
      inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but
      findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the
      results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of
      immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain
      intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 on abdominal distension and gastrointestinal
      transit in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 104-14
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03853.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in
      girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed
      transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing
      Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with
      acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with 
      constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled,
      parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control
      product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms
      were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS:
      Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant
      reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference -
      39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension
      during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal 
      [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P =
      0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P =
      0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in
      objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as
      reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit 
      is a useful strategy for treating distension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To
      investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms
      of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS.
      METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria,
      participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising
      two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB
      30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum
      CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8
      weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly
      during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A
      significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in
      scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was 
      observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the
      probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain
      probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.

TI  - Effects of chili on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in diarrhoea
      predominant irritable bowel syndrome: evidence for capsaicin-sensitive visceral
      nociception hypersensitivity.
PG  - 23-32

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients often complain of gastrointestinal
      symptoms after eating chili. However, the effect of chili ingestion on
      gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients has not been characterized. To study
      the effect of chili-containing foods on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 20 IBS-D patients underwent gastrointestinal
      symptoms and postprandial colonic transit evaluations after ingesting three
      different meals: (i) a standard meal, (ii) a spicy meal (a standard meal mixed
      with 2 g chili), and (iii) a standard meal with 2 g chili in capsules, in a
      randomized crossover fashion. Postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms were scored 
      every 15 min for 2 h using visual analogue scales. Thirty-eight healthy
      volunteers were used as controls. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and
      meals with chili capsules induced only mild abdominal burning relative to the
      standard meals (P < 0.05), whereas it induced significant levels of abdominal
      pain and burning in IBS-D patients (P < 0.05). Other gastrointestinal symptoms
      and postprandial colonic transit after spicy meals and meals with chili capsules 
      did not differ from standard meals in IBS-D and controls (P > 0.05).
      Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and controls reported similar oral burning
      symptoms when eating spicy meals (P > 0.05). Both the spicy meal and the standard
      meal with chili capsules led to similar severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (P 
      > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients exhibit gut hypersensitivity to
      chili. Chili ingestion produced more abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients
      than in healthy volunteers, but was associated with similar oral burning
      symptoms.
