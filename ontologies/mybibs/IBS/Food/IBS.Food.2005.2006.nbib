TI  - [Increased IgE-type antibody response to food allergens in irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 797-802
AB  - BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed
      defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively
      referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from
      dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the
      components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of 
      IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the 
      most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies
      against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and
      IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a
      healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency
      of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of
      the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food
      allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the
      immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control
      group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk
      protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of
      food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group,
      the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of 
      food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of
      this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a 
      diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate
      which is useful therapy in food allergy.

TI  - Bacterial concepts in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - S3-9
AB  - An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype
      groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal
      pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a
      by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food
      takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead 
      of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of
      indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead 
      to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability
      to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS
      symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing
      is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be
      appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent
      improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good
      clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a 
      prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to
      delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth.

AB  - This brief review appraises the current evidence of the efficacy of probiotics,
      including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and VSL#3, in the treatment of irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms potentially important will be evaluated,
      with specific reference to immune function, effects on motility and intraluminal 
      milieu. These experimental and clinical observations suggest that probiotics may 
      play a role in the management of IBS.

TI  - Are probiotics effective in the treatment of fungal colonization of the
      gastrointestinal tract? Experimental and clinical studies.
PG  - 35-49
AB  - UNLABELLED: The influence of fungal colonization and probiotic treatment on the
      course of gastric ulcer (GU) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was not explored. Our
      studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and
      ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60
      patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group.
      Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated.
      Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative
      examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included
      estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI
      tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without
      probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically
      (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area,
      gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines
      IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative
      examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical
      studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and
      patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing 
      and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of 
      animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower
      than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of
      TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all 
      rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in
      92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and
      inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic 
      therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal
      colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the
      duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is
      associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).

AB  - Probiotics discussed in this paper are evaluated using the WHO/FAO definition
      from 2001. The authors present a brief description of the normal microbiota of
      the gastrointestinal tract, discuss probiotics in the aspects of gut immunity and
      then move to selection of bacterial strains as probiotics. The main issue raised 
      is the critical evaluation of probiotics in randomized clinical trials for
      conditions such as: infectious diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea;
      inflammatory bowel disease; pouchitis and diverticulitis; H. pylori infection;
      irritable bowel syndrome. Safety of probiotics is mentioned with respect to
      susceptible individuals and bacterial translocation. As a conclusion the authors 
      again recall the strain specific actions of probiotics in different clinical
      situations and that so far probiotics play a role in rotaviral and post
      antibiotic diarrhoea and pouchitis. An important issue still to be solved in
      order to confidently recommend probiotics as efficacious therapy is the
      regulatory aspect of probiotics.

TI  - Treating irritable bowel syndrome with a food elimination diet followed by food
      challenge and probiotics.
PG  - 514-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the gut-associated immune system may be
      up-regulated resulting in immune complex production, low-grade inflammation, loss
      of Class I bacteria, and translocation of inflammatory mediators and
      macromolecules outside of the GI lumen. Since food intolerance may be one of the 
      reasons for this upregulation, our goal was to investigate the role of food
      intolerance in IBS patients. METHODS: In this open label pilot study, we enrolled
      20 patients with IBS by Rome II criteria (15 women, ages 24-81) who had failed
      standard medical therapies in a tertiary care GI clinic. Baseline serum IgE and
      IgG food and mold panels, and comprehensive stool analysis (CSA) were performed. 
      Breath-hydrogen testing and IBS Quality-of-Life (QOL) questionnaires were
      obtained. Patients underwent food elimination diets based on the results of food 
      and mold panels followed by controlled food challenge. Probiotics were also
      introduced. Repeat testing was performed at 6-months. We followed up with this
      cohort at 1 year after trial completion to assess the reported intervention and
      for placebo effect. RESULTS: Baseline abnormalities were identified on serum IgG 
      food and mold panels in 100% of the study subjects with significant improvement
      after food elimination and rotation diet (p < 0.05). Significant improvements
      were seen in stool frequency (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and IBS-QOL scores (p <
      0.0001). Imbalances of beneficial flora and dysbiotic flora were identified in
      100% of subjects by CSA. There was a trend to improvement of beneficial flora
      after treatment but no change in dysbiotic flora. The 1-year follow up
      demonstrated significant continued adherence to the food rotation diet (4.00 +/- 
      1.45), minimal symptomatic problems with IBS (4.00 +/- 1.17), and perception of
      control over IBS (4.15 +/- 1.23). The continued use of probiotics was considered 
      less helpful (3.40 +/- 1.60). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that identifying
      and appropriately addressing food sensitivity in IBS patients not previously
      responding to standard therapy results in a sustained clinical response and
      impacts on overall well being and quality of life in this challenging entity.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a practical review.
PG  - 1235-42; quiz 1243-4, 1284
AB  - The epidemiology and current understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable
      bowel syndrome is reviewed, beginning with a historical perspective. The roles of
      genetics, environment, allergy, infection and inflammation, bacterial overgrowth,
      hormones and motility abnormalities are discussed. Using the current
      evidence-based literature, the practical approach of diagnosis and treatment is
      outlined, including traditional modalities and newer therapeutic agents such as
      serotonin modulators.

TI  - Lipid-induced colonic hypersensitivity in the irritable bowel syndrome: the role 
      of bowel habit, sex, and psychologic factors.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Duodenal lipid infusion increases colonic hypersensitivity in 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Whether this is affected by bowel habit,
      psychologic factors, or sex is unknown. METHODS: We included 61 patients with IBS
      (50 women, 11 men), 25 with diarrhea-predominant IBS, 17 with
      constipation-predominant IBS, 19 with alternating-type IBS, and 20 healthy
      controls (15 women, 5 men). A colonic distension trial was performed with a
      barostat before and after a 1-hour duodenal lipid infusion (3 kcal/min). Colonic 
      thresholds, colonic tone, and the viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed
      and compared between groups. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression scale. RESULTS: The reduction in colonic pressure thresholds after vs 
      before duodenal lipids was greater in patients than in controls for discomfort (P
      = .006) and pain (P < .0001). An increased viscerosomatic referral area for pain 
      and discomfort during colonic distensions after vs before duodenal lipids was
      observed in patients but not in controls. The response was similar in IBS
      subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit, in patients with vs without
      anxiety and/or depression, and in women and men with IBS. The colonic tone
      response during lipid infusion was similar in IBS patients and controls, and in
      the different IBS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients show increased colonic
      sensitivity and altered viscerosomatic referral pattern after duodenal lipids.
      This response is largely unaffected by the predominant bowel habit, psychologic
      factors, or sex, but seems to be related to IBS per se.

TI  - Role of gut microflora and probiotic effects in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though the cause of irritable bowel sindrome (IBS) is not yet
      known, alterations of the intestinal microflora may be important in its
      pathogenesis. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of rifaximine alone or in association
      with the probiotic strain of Bifidobacterium longum W11 in reducing symptoms in
      patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a monocentric, prospective, randomized
      open trial including 70 patients randomized in to two groups: Group A (41
      patients) receiving rifaximin 200 (2 cp bid for ten days in a month) followed by 
      a formulation of the probiotic strain of Bifidobacterium longum W11(one
      granulated suspension for 6 days on alternate weeks ) and Group B (29 patients)
      receiving only rifaximin 200 (2 cp bid for ten days in a month). The clinical
      evaluation was performed at admission and after 2-months, taking into account the
      method of visual analogous. RESULTS: At the 2-month follow-up, Group A patients
      reported a greater improvement of symptoms compared to patients in group B (p =
      0.010) even if the physician's opinion at T1 did not confirm these results (p =
      0.07). CONCLUSION: The increased colonisation by Bifi-dobacterium longum W11,
      after the cyclic administration of rifaximin, which eradicates the bacterial
      overgrowth of the small intestine, may reduce symptoms, especially those related 
      to bowel habit and stool frequency in patients with IBS. The abnormalities
      observed in the colonic flora of IBS suggest, in fact, that a probiotic approach 
      will ultimately be justified.

TI  - Relationship between asthma and irritable bowel syndrome: role of food allergy.
PG  - 773-5
AB  - The increasing prevalence of both asthma and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are
      major health problems. One hundred twenty-five patients with asthma and 95
      healthy subjects were included in this study. The rate of IBS was 29.6% and 12.7%
      (p < 0.005), and the incidence of food allergy was 7.2% and 2.1% (p > 0.05)
      respectively for asthma and control group. There was no significant association
      between asthma related parameters, IBS, and food allergy. There is not a single
      clear reason as to what causes IBS, so further studies are needed to clarify the 
      potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying the association between IBS and
      asthma.

TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus modulates intestinal pain and induces opioid and
      cannabinoid receptors.
PG  - 35-7
AB  - Abdominal pain is common in the general population and, in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome, is attributed to visceral hypersensitivity. We found
      that oral administration of specific Lactobacillus strains induced the expression
      of mu-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells, and
      mediated analgesic functions in the gut-similar to the effects of morphine. These
      results suggest that the microbiology of the intestinal tract influences our
      visceral perception, and suggest new approaches for the treatment of abdominal
      pain and irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Health-related quality of life, work productivity, and health care resource
      utilization of subjects with irritable bowel syndrome: baseline results from
      LOGIC (Longitudinal Outcomes Study of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Canada), a
      naturalistic study.
PG  - 1726-35; discussion 1710-1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and constipation are
      gastrointestinal dysmotility and sensory symptoms associated with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). No studies have followed patients with IBS symptoms for 1 year
      under conditions of routine clinical practice to assess prospectively the impact 
      of treatments on health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this ongoing,
      naturalistic study is to assess the long-term impact of IBS treatments on quality
      of life (QOL), work productivity, and resource utilization. This report describes
      the baseline characteristics and patterns of care of the patients enrolled in
      this study. METHODS: Patients with physician-diagnosed IBS symptoms were enrolled
      from 147 physician sites across Canada between May 4, 2004, and March 31, 2005.
      Clinical data were collected at baseline and at the end of the 12-month follow-up
      (patients were followed for 1 year between May 4, 2005, and March 31, 2006).
      Patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and at months 1, 2, 6, 9,
      and 12. Health-related QOL, health status, and work productivity were assessed
      with the IBS-QOL, a 5-item EuroQol descriptive system, and Work Productivity and 
      Activity Impairment questionnaires, respectively. A resource utilization
      questionnaire elicited information on physician; visits, treatments, and
      procedures. Baseline data are reported here. RESULTS: Data were obtained from
      1555 patients; 85.1% (1320/1552) were women. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 45.8
      (15.0) years and mean (SD) duration of IBS symptoms of 11.4 (11.5) years.
      Self-reported bowel patterns were predominantly constipation (41.0%, 587/1433)
      and constipation alternating with diarrhea (39.4%, 564/1433); 60.3% (938/1555) of
      subjects used > or =3 IBS treatments in the previous 4 weeks. Approximately 50%
      of all patients reported distress "quite a bit or "extremely" for abdominal pain,
      gas, bloating, and constipation. The mean overall IBS-QOL score (0-100 scale,
      with 0 indicating poor QOL) was 66.3; food avoidance (51.8) and health worry
      (59.3) were the most serious concerns. Patients reported 5.6% work absenteeism,
      31.4% presenteeism, and 34.6% overall work productivity loss, equivalent to 13.8 
      hours lost productivity per 40-hour workweek. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline data from
      this ongoing, prospective, naturalistic study are consistent with previous
      findings that suggested significant use of health care resources with concomitant
      low QOL and decreased work productivity in patients with IBS symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of live combined Bifidobacterium, 
      Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
      METHODS: Eighty-five patients [male 32, female 53; age (45.31+/-11.72) years]
      were given live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules
      1260 mg/d t.i.d.x4 weeks. Syndrome scales were used to evaluate the efficacy in
      gastrointestinal syndrome. Fecal flora was also measured before and after the
      treatment. Six bacteria were cultured and the colony forming units were counted
      in stool. SPSS was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients
      finished the follow-up. No side-effect was found. For treatment of irritable
      bowel syndrome, the effective rate of live combined Bifidobacterium,
      Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules was 56.8% in the second week, 74.3% in
      the fourth week and 73.0% in the sixth week. Single symptom was improved,
      especially in abdominal pain and stool character. The probiotica containing live 
      combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus could increase
      bifidobacterium count (P<0.01) and lactobacillus count (P<0.05); decrease
      bacteroides count (P<0.05) and enterococci count (P<0.01); No obvious changes
      were observed in clostridium difficile colonitis and enterobacteriaceae (P>0.05).
      CONCLUSION: The result of the study indicated that the administration of live
      combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus improved the symptom of 
      irritable bowel syndrome and that there was a gradual increase of this effect.
      Thereafter conditions remained stable for 2 weeks. That improvement may be
      associated with alterations in gastrointestinal flora.

TI  - Role of motility in chronic diarrhoea.
PG  - 1045-55
AB  - Patients complaining of 'chronic diarrhoea' usually mean the passage of loose,
      urgent stools. Chronic diarrhoea is a feature of malabsorption; it may also be
      seen in the 'dumping syndrome' which follows gastric surgery, small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth, bile salt malabsorption and in malabsorption of simple
      sugars including most commonly lactose, fructose and sorbitol. Excessively rapid 
      entry of chyme into the small or large intestine generates propulsive motor
      patterns leading to accelerated transit. Inflammation is associated with
      decreased normal mixing motor patterns but increased propulsive motility
      including high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs). Evidence for abnormal
      small intestinal motility in the diarrhoea associated with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) is conflicting and any difference appears small. Increased colonic
      HAPCs with increased propulsion is seen in IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D).
      Stress-induced colonic motility is increased in IBS-D with hyper-responsiveness
      to corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Long-lasting increases in mucosal
      serotonin availability may contribute to the chronic diarrhoea seen in IBS-D and 
      coeliac disease. Treatments for abnormal motility in chronic diarrhoea include
      those designed to correct specific underlying abnormalities including octreotide,
      antibiotics, colestyramine, specific food avoidance and anti-inflammatory agents.
      There are also treatments aimed primarily at altering motility directly including
      opiates, 5HT3 receptor antagonists and amitriptyline.

TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. A case control experience.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - AIM: As optimal therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains elusive,
      current approach to therapy is based on symptomatic treatment. With this
      case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS
      patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, 
      angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and
      probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus
      thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 
      women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean
      period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men
      and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their
      customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the
      presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and
      alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values,
      the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55%
      (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in 
      diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared
      with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was
      found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups
      showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was
      statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension
      (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a 
      significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of 
      bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term
      benefit of the study product.

TI  - Effect of a symbiotic preparation on the clinical manifestations of irritable
      bowel syndrome, constipation-variant. Results of an open, uncontrolled
      multicenter study.
PG  - 349-58
AB  - AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently associated with an imbalance in
      intestinal bacteria. To date, few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety 
      of probiotic administration in patients with constipation-variant IBS. A new
      agent recently available in clinical practice is a symbiotic consisting of a
      probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum W11, and the short chain oligosaccharide
      prebiotic Fos Actilight. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of this symbiotic in patients with constipation-variant IBS. METHODS: A
      total of 636 patients (250 men, 386 women) diagnosed with constipation-type IBS
      according to the Roma II criteria were enrolled in 43 centers and received the
      symbiotic at a dose of 3 g/die for at least 36 days. A validated questionnaire
      investigating symptoms and stool frequency was administered before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: Based on patient responses to visual scale items, frequency
      increased significantly after treatment in the ''no symptom'' class from 3% to
      26.7% for bloating and from 8.4% to 44.1% for abdominal pain (P<0.0001). In the
      more severe symptoms classes (moderate-severe), symptom frequency dropped
      significantly from 62.9% to 9.6% and from 38.8% to 4.1% for bloating and
      abdominal pain, respectively. Stool frequency significantly increased from
      2.9+/-1.6 times/week to 4.1+/-1.6 times/ week. CONCLUSIONS: The study product can
      increase stool frequency in patients with constipation-variant IBS and reduce
      abdominal pain and bloating in those with moderate-severe symptoms.

TI  - Effects of fasting therapy on irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 214-20
AB  - How to treat patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who do not respond to
      pharmacotherapy is an unsolved problem. Psychotherapy, which has been reported on
      in previous studies, is available only in specific centers. We describe in this
      study a novel and simple psychotherapy; that is, the fasting therapy (FT) for
      treatment of patients with IBS. Of 84 inpatients with IBS, 58 patients who still 
      had moderate to severe IBS symptoms after 4-week basic treatment were
      investigated retrospectively. Of the 58 patients enrolled in this study, 36
      underwent FT, whereas the remaining 22 received a consecutive basic treatment
      (control therapy). There were no significant differences in the 4-point severity 
      scales of gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms between the 2 groups before
      the start of FT. The basic treatment consisted of pharmacotherapy and brief
      psychotherapy, whereas the FT consisted of 10 days of starvation followed by 5
      days of refeeding. Changes in scores of symptoms before and after each treatment 
      were analyzed. FT significantly improved 7 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that 
      is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p < .001), abdominal distension (p < .001),
      diarrhea (p < .001), anorexia (p = .02), nausea (p < .01), anxiety (p < .001),
      and interference with life in general (p < .001). However, the control therapy
      significantly improved only 3 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal
      pain-discomfort (p = .03), abdominal distension (p < .01), and interference with 
      life (p = .01). Our results suggest that FT may have beneficial effects on
      intractable patients with IBS.

TI  - Clinical studies on alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 576-80
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common diagnoses in
      gastroenterology, but current therapies are inefficient. Recent clinical trials
      suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in IBS. Because of the
      heterogeneity of IBS a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single 
      strain. We screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic
      combination consisting of L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, P. freudenreichii 
      ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The clinical efficacy of the
      probiotic combination was evaluated in IBS patients in a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. During six months the
      subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. IBS symptoms
      were followed by symptom diaries. The probiotic supplementation demonstrated
      significant value in reducing IBS symptoms. At the end of the study period the
      total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had
      reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory
      effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the
      probiotic. The probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the
      combination that each strain alone would not hold. In conclusion, we found a
      probiotic combination of LGG and three other strains to be effective in
      alleviating IBS symptoms.

TI  - Intestinal colonisation, microbiota and future probiotics?
PG  - 558-62
AB  - The human intestine is colonized by a large number of microorganisms,
      collectively termed microbiota, which support a variety of physiological
      functions. As the major part of the microbiota has not yet been cultured,
      molecular methods are required to determine microbial composition and the impact 
      of specific dietary components including probiotics. Probiotics are viable
      microbial food supplements, which have a beneficial impact on human health.
      Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic
      products. The most significant demonstrations for probiotic efficacy include
      prevention and treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea
      and allergy prevention. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (=ATCC 53103) and
      Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 are the among the best-characterized and most studied
      probiotic strains with demonstrated impact on human health. New complex targets
      for probiotics include irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori
      infection. For future probiotics the most important target is a demonstrated
      clinical benefit supported by knowledge on the mechanistic actions in the
      microbiota of the target population. Molecular and genomics-based knowledge of
      the composition and functions of the microbiota, as well as deviations from the
      balanced microbiota, will advance the selection of new and specific probiotics.
      Potential combinations of specific probiotics may prove to be the next step to
      reduce the risk on intestinal diseases and reconstruct specific microbial
      deviations.

TI  - Bacterial overgrowth as a cause of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 669-73
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recently published studies investigating any
      association between gut flora and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Experimental studies demonstrate associations between gut flora, gut
      motility, mucosal inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Scientific bases
      for possible benefits of selected probiotics on irritable bowel symptoms have
      been identified. Disturbances in viable counts of fecal flora have been
      demonstrated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Results of studies based 
      on breath tests are conflicting as to whether the prevalence of small intestinal 
      bacterial overgrowth is increased in this group. Nonetheless, a longitudinal
      analysis based on bacteriological assessments of serial small intestinal
      aspirates suggests that this entity should be considered in patients with
      irritable bowel symptoms, especially in the setting of predisposition to
      bacterial overgrowth. Clinical trials of probiotic treatment for irritable bowel 
      syndrome have yielded conflicting results. SUMMARY: Recent studies provide
      increasing support for the concept that disturbances in gut flora occur in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome and that such abnormalities may contribute
      to irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms. The relative importance of disturbed
      gut flora to symptom pathogenesis, along with the therapeutic potential of
      modulation of the gut flora for amelioration of irritable bowel syndrome
      symptoms, however, remains to be fully defined.

TI  - Allergy and intestinal dysmotility--evidence of genuine causal linkage?
PG  - 664-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The relationship between allergy and motility has been
      controversial. There is, however, accumulating evidence demonstrating that
      mucosal allergic responses may disrupt gut motility, and may also potentially
      alter nociceptive pathways to cause visceral hyperalgesia. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Experimental studies implicate T helper 2 cells and the cytokines interleukin-4
      and -13 in antigen-induced dysmotility, and interleukin-5 in the pathogenesis of 
      mucosal eosinophilia. Both mast cells and eosinophils play obligatory roles in
      different forms of experimental antigen-induced dysmotility. Overall clinical
      findings appear to implicate eosinophil infiltration in proximal and distal
      dysmotility syndromes (oesophageal, gastric and colorectal), and induced mast
      cell degranulation in mid-gut dysmotility. There is also evidence that mucosal
      allergic responses may induce long-term changes in visceral perception, including
      alteration of limbic response, leading to sustained abnormality in visceral
      sensation. SUMMARY: Clinical evidence implicating mucosal allergic responses in
      dysmotility has been extended to include disorders considered previously entirely
      functional, such as in some cases of irritable bowel syndrome. Only a proportion 
      of cases are, however, caused by food allergy and a future challenge is to
      differentiate patients with similar symptoms, but induced by different
      mechanisms.

TI  - Probiotics as functional food in the treatment of diarrhea.
PG  - 717-21
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A disturbance in microbial balance of the gastrointestinal
      tract is often associated with diarrhea. Therefore, probiotics, as beneficial
      microorganisms for host health, have attracted clinical attention for their
      potential therapeutic application in the treatment of diarrhea. This review
      focuses on new research findings relevant to the effects of probiotics on
      diarrhea prevention and treatment and potential mechanisms of action for this
      alternative therapy for diarrhea. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials suggest
      potential beneficial effects of probiotic therapy for preventing and treating
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute diarrhea including rotavirus-induced
      diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
      The most extensively studied probiotics for diarrhea are Lactobacillus,
      Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces, with potential mechanisms of therapeutic
      action based on the protection of intestinal epithelial cell and barrier
      function, prevention of enterotoxin binding to intestinal epithelial cells, and
      regulation of intestinal microbial environment. SUMMARY: Growing evidence
      suggests that probiotics may serve as a functional food in the treatment of
      diarrhea. Remaining challenges include identifying mechanisms of action to
      provide the basis of more refined hypothesis-driven clinical trials. The correct 
      combination and concentration of probiotics applied to the appropriate
      gastrointestinal disorders may improve the efficacy of this approach for diarrhea
      and other diseases.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children.
PG  - 550-7
AB  - Probiotics are marketed in several countries and widely used by pediatric health 
      care providers. Although probiotics can be helpful for specific disorders, they
      have been broadly prescribed for disorders without clear evidence to support
      their use. Furthermore, in certain specific conditions, probiotics cause clinical
      deterioration. This report is a review and evaluation of the evidence or lack
      thereof to support a beneficial effect of probiotic agents in a variety of
      pediatric conditions and to review the safety and potential adverse events that
      may be encountered when using probiotics. It is also important to emphasize that 
      probiotics are highly heterogeneous with differences in composition, biological
      activity, and dose among the different probiotic preparations.

TI  - Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients show mast cell activation and hyperplasia in
      the jejunum.
PG  - 203-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased numbers of mast cells and mast cell activation in distal
      gut segments are associated with symptom onset and severity in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Although upper gut symptoms are common, mast cells have not been 
      thoroughly evaluated in proximal gut in IBS patients. METHODS: Jejunal biopsies
      obtained by Watson's capsule, aspiration of intestinal fluid and one blood sample
      were obtained in 20 diarrhoea-predominant patients with IBS (D-IBS) and 14
      healthy volunteers (H). Psychological stress (Holmes-Rahe Scale) and depression
      (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated at baseline and food and respiratory
      allergy excluded. Biopsies were processed for H&E staining and microscopic
      inflammation assessed by counting intraepithelial lymphocytes. Mast cells in
      lamina propria were counted by immunohistochemistry with CD117 (c-kit). Tryptase 
      concentration was measured in intestinal fluid and serum. RESULTS: D-IBS patients
      showed higher psychological stress than healthy volunteers (D-IBS: 203 (SD 114) v
      H: 112 (SD 99); p = 0.019). Immunohistochemical staining of jejunal mucosa
      revealed mild increase in intraepithelial CD3+ cells in D-IBS patients (D-IBS:
      15.3 (SD 5.5; 95% CI 12.7 to 17.9) v H: 10.3 (SD 3.9; 95% CI 8.0 to 12.5); p =
      0.006). Moreover, D-IBS patients showed marked increase in mast cells numbers
      (D-IBS: 34 (SD 9.3); H: 15.3 (SD 4.4) mast cells/hpf; p<0.001) and higher
      tryptase concentration in jejunal fluid (D-IBS: 0.45 (SD 0.38); H: 0.09 (SD 0.10)
      microg/l; p = 0.005). Upper gut symptoms were not associated with gender, mast
      cell counts, jejunal tryptase or basal stress. CONCLUSION: This jejunal mucosal
      inflammatory profile may help identify diarrhoea-predominant IBS, a
      stress-related disorder.

TI  - Is there any food I can eat? Living with inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
      and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI)
      disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or
      irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair
      quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living.
      Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the
      evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders,
      particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the
      strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning 
      coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall
      objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had
      been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome.
      This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable
      bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females,
      diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were
      recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada.
      Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires,
      e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed 
      for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means 
      by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or
      controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of
      determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of 
      stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research,
      predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates 
      the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women
      identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that
      they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health 
      nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.

TI  - Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, 
      or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore
      expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics,
      whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to
      incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for 
      prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the
      Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large 
      intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer,
      focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language.
      Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or
      meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose,
      galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large
      bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These
      carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and
      intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small.
      Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few,
      although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel
      disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early
      days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial
      balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.

TI  - Is there a role of food allergy in irritable bowel syndrome and functional
      dyspepsia? A systematic review.
PG  - 595-607
AB  - A significant proportion of adults believe they suffer from food allergy, and
      20-65% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their symptoms
      to something in food that activates an abnormal response. This systematic review 
      evaluates the role of food allergy in aetiology and management of these
      disorders. Activation of gastrointestinal mucosal immune system may be one of the
      causative factors in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia and IBS. This
      activation may result from effects of bacterial infection or other luminal
      factors including commensal microbial flora and food antigens. Some studies have 
      reported on the role of food allergy in IBS; only one epidemiological study on
      functional dyspepsia and food allergy has been published. The mechanism by which 
      food activates mucosal immune system is uncertain, but food specific IgE and IgG4
      appeared to mediate the hypersensitivity reaction in a subgroup of IBS patients. 
      Exclusion diets based on skin prick test, RAST for IgE or IgG4, hypoallergic diet
      and clinical trials with oral disodium cromoglycate have been conducted, and some
      success has been reported in a subset of IBS patients. Further well-controlled
      studies are needed to establish whether food allergy plays a role in the
      pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia and IBS.

TI  - [Probiotic drug therapy with E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN): results of a
      prospective study of the records of 3,807 patients].
PG  - 651-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Living microorganisms that enter the gut in an active state and
      exert a positive influence on the host are called probiotics. Numerous
      experimental and clinical studies were performed recently and confirm both the
      efficacy and modes of action of probiotic drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a
      post-marketing-surveillance study with the probiotic Escherichia Coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) data on the range of indications as well as on efficacy and
      tolerance were gathered prospectively in 446 centres. The intended treatment
      duration was limited to a maximum of 12 weeks. RESULTS: EcN was used in 3,807
      patients with more than 20 different indications, n = 3,511 of whom had
      gastrointestinal complaints: Among others, 1,067 patients presented with
      chronically recurring (n = 728) or protracted diarrhoea (n = 339), 415 with
      inflammatory bowel disease, 679 with irritable bowel syndrome, and 253 with
      chronic constipation. The overall efficacy was assessed as good to very good by
      an average of 81.4 % of the therapists. The stool frequency and consistency as
      well as the symptoms of meteorism and abdominal pain were improved in very many
      patients. Suspected cases of side effects were documented in only 2.8 % of the
      patients. CONCLUSION: EcN is frequently used in practice for the treatment of
      various, mostly gastrointestinal, complaints and is well tolerated.

TI  - [Role of allergy in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 1532-5
AB  - Preliminary studies have noted a possible association between IBS and allergic
      disorders. An increased prevalence of bronchial hyper-responsiveness in IBS has
      been reported. Moreover, foods are thought to often play a role in the diarrhea
      type IBS particularly in patients with atopic dermatitis. More than 50% of
      diarrhea type IBS patients have a history of allergies to some food and positive 
      skin prick tests. Surveys indicate that as many as 20-30 % of adults have some
      problems to foods, however, careful studies have suggested a range from <1% to
      7.5%. A systematic review of the literature concluded that it is still unclear
      whether diet is a key factor in exacerbating IBS symptoms and whether dietary
      manipulation is a valid treatment. The further studies are needed to evaluate the
      association between IBS and allergic disorders.

AB  - While the precise pathophysiology of IBS remains to be elucidated, dysmotility
      and altered visceral perception/sensation are currently the most popular
      hypotheses. More recently, roles for enteric infection and intestinal
      inflammation have been proposed. Probiotics, defined as live or attenuated
      bacteria or bacterial products that confer a significant health benefit to the
      host, have the potential to provide a clinical tool to explore these
      interactions. We reviewed the effects of probiotics on IBS symptoms.

TI  - New insights and directions in travelers' diarrhea.
PG  - 337-53, viii-ix
AB  - Since first studied more than 5 decades ago the risk of travelers'diarrhea for
      persons going from industrialized regions to developing countries has remained
      high. Most cases of illness are caused by bacterial agents. Travelers' diarrhea
      is associated with temporary disability and it may progress to chronic intestinal
      illness and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Exercising care about food
      and beverage intake, the use of rifaximin prophylaxis for selective patients, and
      self-treatment of all resultant illness will continue to be the way in which the 
      disease is prevented or managed best by travelers. Future approaches will be
      aimed at making host regions safer and providing more effective methods of
      treatment and prevention of enteric disease during short-term international
      travel.

TI  - Bran and irritable bowel syndrome: the primary-care perspective.
PG  - 737-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have shown that bran exacerbates irritable bowel syndrome symptoms
      in a large proportion of secondary-care patients. However, it is unknown if this 
      also happens in primary-care or whether a better response to bran occurs, leading
      to bran failures being selected for referral to the specialist. AIMS: To assess
      the response to bran in primary-care irritable bowel syndrome comparing it to
      that obtained in secondary-care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive
      primary-care irritable bowel syndrome patients were asked how bran or soluble
      fibre products affected their symptoms. RESULTS: Bran improved symptoms in 27% of
      primary-care and 10% of secondary-care patients (p<0.01) and exacerbated symptoms
      in 22% of primary-care and 55% of secondary-care patients (p<0.001). Fifty-one
      percent of primary-care and 33% of secondary-care patients reported no change
      with bran. In primary-care, proprietary fibre led to improvement in 25%,
      deterioration in 19% and no change in 56% which was not significantly different
      to secondary-care. CONCLUSION: Although not especially effective in primary-care 
      irritable bowel syndrome patients, bran does not cause so many problems and is
      more helpful than in secondary-care. The effects of soluble fibre are similar in 
      both primary-care and secondary-care. This study highlights the problem of
      extrapolating the response to treatment in irritable bowel syndrome from
      different care settings.

TI  - Sex differences in irritable bowel syndrome in Japanese university students.
PG  - 562-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among young
      adults are few, especially in Asian countries. Our aim was to examine the
      prevalence of IBS, whether there was a sex difference, and whether allergic
      diseases were important risk factors for IBS in young adults. METHODS: Newly
      enrolled university students completed health survey questionnaires regarding
      general health. Those with gastrointestinal symptoms completed the
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and an additional questionnaire
      covering the presence of allergic manifestations. IBS was diagnosed based on the 
      Rome II criteria. RESULTS: IBS was diagnosed in 268 of 2495 students [10.7%;
      constipation-predominant type (IBS-C), 128; diarrhea-predominant type (IBS-D),
      117; unclassified, 23]. IBS-C was associated with female sex (odds ratio, 6.4;
      95% confidence interval, 4.1-9.7; P < 0.001), whereas there was no sex difference
      in IBS-D. The proportions of subjects with food sensitivity were significantly
      different among the three groups (4.0%, subjects without IBS; 8.6%, IBS-C group; 
      and 15.4%, IBS-D group) (P < 0.001). The median GSRS scores for pain (1.67 vs 1, 
      P = 0.001), indigestion (1.75 vs 1.5, P < 0.001), and constipation (2.0 vs 1.33, 
      P < 0.001) were higher, and the median diarrhea score was lower (1.33 vs 1.67) (P
      < 0.001), in women than in men. The median score for diarrhea (2.33 vs 1.67, P = 
      0.001) was significantly higher in subjects with food sensitivity than in those
      without. CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong relationship between IBS-C and female
      sex, and food sensitivity seemed to be an exacerbating factor for IBS-D.

TI  - Efficacy of an encapsulated probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 in women
      with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1581-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria exhibit a variety of properties, including
      immunomodulatory activity, which are unique to a particular strain. Thus, not all
      species will necessarily have the same therapeutic potential in a particular
      condition. We have preliminary evidence that Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 may
      have utility in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was
      designed to confirm the efficacy of the probiotic bacteria B. infantis 35624 in a
      large-scale, multicenter, clinical trial of women with IBS. A second objective of
      the study was to determine the optimal dosage of probiotic for administration in 
      an encapsulated formulation. METHODS: After a 2-wk baseline, 362 primary care IBS
      patients, with any bowel habit subtype, were randomized to either placebo or
      freeze-dried, encapsulated B. infantis at a dose of 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(8), or 1 x 
      10(10), cfu/mL for 4 wk. IBS symptoms were monitored daily and scored on to a
      6-point Likert scale with the primary outcome variable being abdominal pain or
      discomfort. A composite symptom score, the subject's global assessment of IBS
      symptom relief, and measures of quality of life (using the IBS-QOL instrument)
      were also recorded. RESULTS: B. infantis 35624 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) cfu was
      significantly superior to placebo and all other bifidobacterium doses for the
      primary efficacy variable of abdominal pain as well as the composite score and
      scores for bloating, bowel dysfunction, incomplete evacuation, straining, and the
      passage of gas at the end of the 4-wk study. The improvement in global symptom
      assessment exceeded placebo by more than 20% (p < 0.02). Two other doses of
      probiotic (1 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(10)) were not significantly different from
      placebo; of these, the 1 x 10(10) dose was associated with significant
      formulation problems. No significant adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS:
      B. infantis 35624 is a probiotic that specifically relieves many of the symptoms 
      of IBS. At a dosage level of 1 x 10(8) cfu, it can be delivered by a capsule
      making it stable, convenient to administer, and amenable to widespread use. The
      lack of benefits observed with the other dosage levels of the probiotic highlight
      the need for clinical data in the final dosage form and dose of probiotic before 
      these products should be used in practice.

AB  - Over the past several years, a number of studies have addressed the role of
      specific strains of bacteria, or combinations thereof, to alleviate certain
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). More importantly, the precise factors
      that contribute to this therapeutic effect, such as modulations in cytokine
      levels and alterations in colonic motility, are being clarified. This review
      serves to summarize the evidence for the use of probiotics in the treatment of
      IBS and to place this information in clinical context. Potential future
      developments and areas of possible research are also discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the best program for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS) of constipation type. METHODS: Ninety-five cases of IBS were randomly
      divided into 3 groups. Group A (n = 30) were treated by acupuncture combined with
      microorganism pharmaceutical preparations, group B (n = 35) by oral
      administration of medicine for loosening the bowel to relieve constipation plus
      microorganism pharmaceutical preparations, and group C (n = 30) by simple
      acupuncture. RESULTS: The total effective rates were 90.0%, 77.2% and 66.7%, in
      the group A, B and C, respectively, with a very significant differences as the
      group A compared with those in the groups B, C (P < 0.01), and with no
      significant difference as the group B compared with that of the group C (P > 0.
      05). The intestinal available bacteria, bilidobacteria and lactobacillus,
      increased and enteric bacilli decreased in varying degrees in the 3 groups.
      CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with microorganism pharmaceutical preparations
      has a better therapeutic effect on irritable bowel syndrome of constipation type.

TI  - [The effects of probiotics on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 413-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal 
      (GI) tract disorder that has heterogeneous clinical presentations such as
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distension. It is known
      that several mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Probiotics may
      target one or more pathophysiologic pathways in IBS and may improve the symptoms 
      of IBS. However, the results of studies about probiotics on IBS are
      controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      probiotics on GI symptoms and intestinal gas volume changes in patients with IBS.
      METHODS: Forty patients were randomly allocated to be treated with Medilac DS
      (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecium) (n=20) or placebo (n=20) in a
      double-blind, prospective manner. The change in intestinal gas volume and symptom
      scores after 4-week treatment were evaluated for the efficacy. RESULTS: There was
      no significant difference in bloating, frequency of gas expulsion, frequency of
      defecation, and hardness of stool before and after the treatment. However, the
      severity of abdominal pain and the frequency of abdominal pain decreased
      significantly in Medilac DS group (2.4+/-1.3 cm/day --> 1.6+/-1.6 cm/day,
      1.7+/-1.3/day --> 1.0+/-1.0/day) (p=0.044, p=0.038), but not in placebo group
      (2.1+/-2.0 cm/day --> 1.8+/-2.1 cm/day, 1.3+/-1.2/day --> 1.4+/-1.9/day). In both
      groups, intestinal gas volume at baseline, after 2-week treatment, and after
      4-week treatment did not show significant change. Medilac DS was well tolerated
      without adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Medilac DS is a safe and useful probiotic
      agent for the treatment of abdominal pain in patients with IBS.

TI  - Probiotics and their potential health claims.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - Many studies have attempted to identify specific positive health effects of
      probiotics. One of the challenges in generalizing health effects of probiotics is
      that different strains exert disparate effects on human health. As a result, the 
      efficacy of one strain or species cannot necessarily be inferred from another.
      The objective of this review is to examine the current scientific literature that
      could be used as the basis for potential health claims. More specifically, this
      paper will review existing evidence of different probiotic strains to prevent and
      treat diarrhea, treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treat inflammatory bowel
      disease, and prevent colon cancer. The strongest evidence is related to the use
      of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the prevention and treatment of
      rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Further examination of the literature also shows
      promise in the treatment of some forms of IBS with probiotics. Future studies
      that use consistent supplementation regimes will allow more definitive
      conclusions to be drawn on the effects of probiotics on IBS, inflammatory bowel
      disease, and colon cancer.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: recent and novel therapeutic approaches.
PG  - 1073-88
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal 
      disorder affecting up to 3-15% of the general population in Western countries. It
      is characterised by unexplained abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating in
      association with altered bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered
      to be multifactorial, involving disturbances of the brain-gut-axis: IBS has been 
      associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor functions, visceral
      hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, autonomic dysfunction and mucosal
      inflammation. Traditional IBS therapy is mainly symptom oriented and often
      unsatisfactory. Hence, there is a need for new treatment strategies. Increasing
      knowledge of brain-gut physiology, mechanisms, and neurotransmitters and
      receptors involved in gastrointestinal motor and sensory function have led to the
      development of several new therapeutic approaches. This article provides a
      systematic overview of recently approved or novel medications that show promise
      for the treatment of IBS; classification is based on the physiological systems
      targeted by the medication. The article includes agents acting on the serotonin
      receptor or serotonin transporter system, novel selective anticholinergics,
      alpha-adrenergic agonists, opioid agents, cholecystokinin antagonists, neurokinin
      antagonists, somatostatin receptor agonists, neurotrophin-3, corticotropin
      releasing factor antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase-c
      agonists, melatonin and atypical benzodiazepines. Finally, the role of probiotics
      and antibacterials in the treatment of IBS is summarised.

TI  - Rectal sensation, pelvic floor function and symptom severity in Hispanic
      population with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.
PG  - 488-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C,
      Rome II) we determined if pelvic floor function correlates with rectal
      sensitivity and tone, and if the pelvic and rectal measurements correlate with
      symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sensory thresholds and tone in fasting and
      postprandial states were evaluated with an electronic barostat in 34 patients and
      10 normal controls. The pelvic floor was assessed by defaecography. RESULTS: Pain
      threshold to rectal distension was lower in IBS-C patients (P = 0.007).
      Postprandially, IBS-C patients showed lower values for sensation of gas,
      perception of urge, and pain threshold compared with controls. In IBS-C the
      anorectal angle widened less and showed less perineal mobility during defecation;
      the rectal tone in fasting IBS-C patients correlated with the angle at rest (P = 
      0.04) and with the perineal descent at rest (P = 0.01). The severity of abdominal
      discomfort or pain, and abdominal fullness correlated with the anorectal angle.
      The duration of symptoms and frequency of bowel movements correlated with
      perineal descent. Straining, mucus expulsion, and the feeling of incomplete
      evacuation correlated with rectal sensitivity variables. CONCLUSION: Patients
      with IBS-C have lowered sensory thresholds for noxious and non-noxious stimuli,
      increased visceral sensitivity after food, less perineal mobility during
      defecation, and symptoms that correlate with rectal sensitivity and pelvic floor 
      parameters.

AB  - Chronic constipation is defined as a symptom-based disorder based on the presence
      for at least 3 months in the last year of unsatisfactory defecation characterized
      by infrequent stools, difficult stool passage, or both. On the other hand, the
      presence of clinically important abdominal discomfort or pain associated with
      constipation defines irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation. Intake of 
      dietary fibre and bulking agents (psyllium) may be effective in alleviating
      chronic constipation in patients without slow colonic transit or disordered
      constipation. On the other hand, fibre may improve stool consistency in patients 
      with IBS with constipation, but it is considered to be not effective in improving
      abdominal pain, distension or bloating. Probiotics may be effective in relieving 
      constipation; however, the effect of lactic acid bacteria ingestion may be
      dependent on the bacterial strain used and the population being studied.
      Lactulose, which is a substrate for lactic acid bacteria (prebiotic), is
      effective to treat patients with chronic constipation.

TI  - Current and future developments in travelers' diarrhea therapy.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - Diarrhea continues to be the leading health problem among international travelers
      to developing tropical and semi-tropical regions. Despite more than 50 years of
      research providing information about the etiology and pathogenesis of the
      disease, the rate of illness and consequences remain unchanged. An estimated 40% 
      of travelers to developing nations will become ill with diarrhea. Although
      travelers' diarrhea is considered a self-limited disease, novel and effective
      approaches to disease prevention and treatment have been realized in recent
      years. Also, recent evidence has identified a potential for long-term
      complications of the illness, including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. 
      With the advent of poorly absorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin, a treatment option for the 
      common watery diarrhea syndrome equivalent to previously used absorbed
      antibacterial drugs has emerged. Rifaximin with an excellent safety profile and
      limited potential to induce coliform resistance, prevents most of the diarrhea
      that would otherwise occur. With further studies in different settings, new
      consideration should be given to the routine use of chemoprophylaxis for
      travelers to high-risk countries. Antibacterial drugs will continue to be the
      optimal treatment for travelers' diarrhea subjects for the most part caused by
      bacterial enteropathogens and shorten the duration of diarrhea by 1-2 days
      compared with no active drug treatment.

TI  - Nucleotide supplementation: a randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial of
      IntestAidIB in people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome [ISRCTN67764449].
PG  - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary nucleotide supplementation has been shown to have important
      effects on the growth and development of cells which have a rapid turnover such
      as those in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract. Work with infants
      has shown that the incidence and duration of diarrhoea is lower when nucleotide
      supplementation is given, and animal work shows that villi height and crypt depth
      in the intestine is increased as a result of dietary nucleotides. Dietary
      nucleotides may be semi-essential under conditions of ill-health, poor diet or
      stress. Since people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome tend to fulfil these
      conditions, we tested the hypothesis that symptoms would be improved with dietary
      nucleotide supplementation. METHODS: Thirty-seven people with a diagnosis of
      Irritable Bowel gave daily symptom severity ratings for abdominal pain,
      diarrhoea, urgency to have a bowel movement, incomplete feeling of evacuation
      after a bowel movement, bloating, flatulence and constipation for 28 days
      (baseline). They were then assigned to either placebo (56 days) followed by
      experimental (56 days) or the reverse. There was a four week washout period
      before crossover. During the placebo and experimental conditions participants
      took one 500 mg capsule three times a day; in the experimental condition the
      capsule contained the nutroceutical substances. Symptom severity ratings and
      psychological measures (anxiety, depression, illness intrusiveness and general
      health) were obtained and analysed by repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Symptom 
      severity for all symptoms (except constipation) were in the expected direction of
      baseline>placebo>experimental condition. Symptom improvement was in the range 4 -
      6%. A feeling of incomplete evacuation and abdominal pain showed the most
      improvement. The differences between conditions for diarrhoea, bloating and
      flatulence were not significant at the p < .05 level. There were no significant
      differences between the conditions for any of the psychological measures.
      CONCLUSION: Dietary nucleotide supplementation improves some of the symptoms of
      irritable bowel above baseline and placebo level. As expected, placebo effects
      were high. Apart from abdominal pain and urgency to have a bowel movement, the
      improvements, while consistent, are modest, and were not accompanied by
      improvements in any of the psychological measures. We suggest that the percentage
      improvement over and above the placebo effect is a physiological effect of the
      nucleotide supplement on the gut. The mechanisms by which these effects might
      improve symptoms are discussed.

TI  - Increased cholecystectomy rate in the laparoscopic era: a study of the potential 
      causative factors.
PG  - 883-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that an increased cholecystectomy rate in the
      laparoscopic era may be due to a reduced threshold for surgery or diagnostic
      confusion with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aims to determine the
      validity of these suggestions. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to patients who 
      had undergone cholecystectomy between 1988-1990 (open) and 1998-2000
      (laparoscopic). Patients were asked about abdominal pain, fatty food intolerance,
      jaundice, and indigestion pre- and postoperatively. Questionnaires included Rome 
      II criteria for the diagnosis of IBS and SF-36 quality-of-life data. Histological
      severity of gallbladder disease was assessed using a standard scoring system.
      RESULTS: A total of 124 of 196 patients in the open group and 264 of 400 patients
      in the laparoscopic group replied. There was no difference between the groups in 
      gender, age at surgery, IBS incidence, or quality-of-life scores. The
      laparoscopic group reported a lower incidence of preoperative fat intolerance
      (45.8 vs 58.1%, p < 0.05) and a higher incidence of persistent postoperative
      abdominal pain (27.3 vs 17.7%, p < 0.05). Mean histopathology severity scores
      were higher in the open group (4.42 vs 3.95, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased
      cholecystectomy rate in the laparoscopic era cannot be attributed to diagnostic
      confusion with IBS. However, a reduction in the threshold for surgery may have
      contributed to the increased rate of cholecystectomy.

TI  - Functional dyspepsia: the role of visceral hypersensitivity in its pathogenesis.
PG  - 2672-6
AB  - Functional, or non-ulcer, dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common reasons for
      referral to gastroenterologists. It is associated with significant morbidity and 
      impaired quality of life. Many authorities believe that functional dyspepsia and 
      irritable bowel syndrome represent part of the spectrum of the same disease
      process. The pathophysiology of FD remains unclear but several theories have been
      proposed including visceral hypersensitivity, gastric motor dysfunction,
      Helicobacter pylori infection and psychosocial factors. In this review, we look
      at the evidence, to date, for the role of visceral hypersensitivity in the
      aetiology of FD.

TI  - Probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases in children: hard and not-so-hard
      evidence of efficacy.
PG  - 454-75
AB  - The use of probiotics, once discussed primarily in the context of alternative
      medicine, is now entering mainstream medicine. However, only a few of the
      potential health benefits attributed to probiotics have been confirmed in
      well-designed, well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials. This is especially 
      true in the pediatric population. We review here the available evidence on
      efficacy of probiotics in children in the prevention and treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases. Although we restrict our analysis to the pediatric
      age, whenever potentially relevant information is available only from adult
      studies, they are examined as well. Probiotics have been most extensively studied
      in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, where their efficacy can be considered
      well established. Studies documenting effects in other childhood gastrointestinal
      illnesses are few, although some preliminary results are promising. Furthermore, 
      only a limited number of probiotic strains have been tested, and, as the effects 
      of different probiotic microorganisms are not equivalent, results cannot be
      generalized. Thus, at present, we have some positive certainties, lots of
      exciting promises and many unanswered questions.

PG  - 2382-7
AB  - AIM: To correlate the clinical features of treated and untreated patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to the results of skin prick test (SPT) for food
      and inhalant allergens. METHODS: We recruited 105 subjects to form three
      different target groups: treated group (n=44) undergoing treatment for IBS,
      untreated group (n=31) meeting the Rome II criteria without treatment for IBS,
      control group (n=30) with no IBS symptoms. RESULTS: SPT results were different
      among the three groups in which SPT was positive in 17 (38.6%) treated patients, 
      in 5 (16.1%) untreated patients and in 1 (3.3%) control (P<0.01). The number of
      positive SPTs was greater in the IBS group than in the control group (P<0.001).
      The number of positive food SPTs was higher in the treated IBS group than in the 
      untreated IBS group (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Positive food SPT is higher in IBS
      patients than in controls.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or 
      in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful
      in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the
      prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the
      maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results
      indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent 
      atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say
      they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend
      probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention
      of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger
      and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative
      and dose-ranging trials.

TI  - Probiotics and chronic disease.
PG  - 270-4
AB  - In today's climate, changed lifestyles and the increased use of antibiotics are
      significant factors that affect the preservation of a healthy intestinal
      microflora. The concept of probiotics is to restore and maintain a microflora
      advantageous to the human body. Probiotics are found in a number of fermented
      dairy products, infant formula, and dietary supplements. Basic research on
      probiotics has suggested several modes of action beneficial for the human body
      and clinical research has proven its preventive and curative features in
      different intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Chronic diseases cause
      considerable disablement in patients and represent a substantial economic burden 
      on healthcare resources. Research has demonstrated a crucial role of nutrition in
      the prevention of chronic disease. Thus, positive, strain-specific effects of
      probiotics have been shown in diarrheal diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, and in
      atopic diseases and in the prevention of cancer. As the majority of probiotics
      naturally inhabit the human intestinal microflora, their use has been regarded as
      very safe. However, in view of the range of potential benefits on health that
      might be achieved by the use of some probiotic bacteria, major and thorough
      evaluation is still necessary. In conclusion, probiotics act as an adjuvant in
      the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of chronic diseases.

TI  - Probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome: rationale, putative mechanisms, and
      evidence of clinical efficacy.
PG  - 264-9
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) follows an acute, presumably infectious
      diarrheal illness in approximately 15% of patients. There may be a persistent,
      mild inflammatory state with changes in mucosal function or structure. Changes in
      the colonic bacterial flora reported in IBS seem related to predominant bowel.
      Colonic bacteria normally metabolize nutrients with the formation of gas and
      short chain fatty acids. The latter may induce propulsive contractions and
      accelerate colonic transit or they may enhance fluid and sodium absorption in the
      colon. This review addresses the mechanisms, rationale and current evidence for
      the efficacy of probiotics, including Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and VSL#3, in
      the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms influenced by probiotics include immune
      function, motility, and the intraluminal milieu. Probiotics may suppress the
      low-grade inflammation associated with IBS or restore normal local immune
      function. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria subspecies are able to deconjugate and 
      absorb bile acids, potentially reducing the colonic mucosal secretion of mucin
      and fluids that may contribute to functional diarrhea or IBS with diarrhea.
      Therapeutic trials show the potential benefit of Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli
      species alone or in the specific probiotic combination, VSL#3, on symptoms in
      IBS. Colonic transit was retarded in IBS patients treated with VSL#3 without
      induction of significant changes in bowel function. In summary, probiotics are
      promising therapies in IBS.

TI  - Prevalence, sociodemography, and quality of life of older versus younger patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome: a population-based study.
PG  - 446-53
AB  - We studied the prevalence as well as the sociodemographic characteristics and QOL
      of older adults (> 50 years) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among the
      population at large and compared it to their younger counterparts'. We
      hypothesized that IBS is less prevalent among older persons and they suffer
      poorer QOL compared to younger IBS patients. A total of 1000 adults from nine
      sites, including a medical center, churches, and a blood bank in our metropolitan
      area (670 African Americans, 320 Caucasians, and 10 others), completed
      self-administered questionnaires providing sociodemographic information and
      details regarding bowel habits and associated symptoms for diagnosing the IBS
      based on Rome II criteria. QOL was assessed by the SF-12 questionnaire. The study
      database was divided into two groups, younger (< 50 years) and older (> or = 50
      years). The two age groups were similar with respect to gender and household
      income. Ninety-five of the 1000 participants had IBS, giving a total sample
      prevalence of 9.5% (< 50 years, 9.9%, vs > or = 50 years, 7.6%). The prevalence
      of IBS was similar in the two groups irrespective of race, sex, marital status,
      size of household, location of residence (rural versus urban), level of
      educational status, and household income. Compared to the older group, there was 
      a trend toward a higher prevalence of IBS among divorced subjects (12.7% vs 0%; P
      = 0.1) and those below poverty level of income (15.3% vs 7.5%; P = 0.09) in the
      younger subjects. In contrast, older IBS patients were more likely to attend
      church regularly (32.5% vs 58.8%; P < 0.05). There were no differences in history
      of traveler's diarrhea, food intolerance, and drug allergies between the two
      groups. Health care utilization was similar between the two IBS groups in terms
      of number of physician visits, use of prescription and alternative medications,
      and being disabled due to IBS. There was no difference in the overall QOL score
      means (27.8 vs 29.5; P = NS) or in its general health and physical functioning
      components. However, older IBS patients had better social functioning (9.1 vs
      9.8; P < 0.05). Although in our study IBS occurred less frequently among older
      adults than among younger patients, the difference is not statistically
      significant. While IBS affects QOL at all ages, social functioning was actually
      better on average among older compared to younger IBS patients.

TI  - Probiotics: their role in the treatment and prevention of disease.
PG  - 261-75
AB  - A probiotic is a "live microbial food ingredients that, when ingested in
      sufficient quantities, exerts health benefits on the consumer". Probiotics exert 
      their benefits through several mechanisms; they prevent colonization, cellular
      adhesion and invasion by pathogenic organisms, they have direct antimicrobial
      activity and they modulate the host immune response. The strongest evidence for
      the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in their use for the prevention
      of symptoms of lactose intolerance, treatment of acute diarrhea, attenuation of
      antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal side effects and the prevention and
      treatment of allergy manifestations. More research needs to be carried out to
      clarify conflicting findings on the use of probiotics for prevention of
      travelers' diarrhea, infections in children in daycare and dental caries, and
      elimination of nasal colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria. Promising
      ongoing research is being conducted on the use of probiotics for the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile colitis, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection,
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and prevention of relapse, treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome, treatment of intestinal inflammation in cystic fibrosis
      patients, and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
      Finally, areas of future research include the use of probiotics for the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis, prevention of cancer and the treatment of
      graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients.

TI  - Probiotics as flourishing benefactors for the human body.
PG  - 26-34
AB  - This article provides a comprehensive review of the beneficial effects of various
      strains of probiotics in preventing and treating certain diseases. Currently,
      changed lifestyles as well as the increased use of antibiotics are significant
      factors challenging the preservation of a healthy intestinal microflora. The
      concept of probiotics is to restore and uphold a microflora advantageous for the 
      human body. Probiotics are found in a number of fermented dairy products, infant 
      formula, and dietary supplements. In the presence of prebiotics, which are
      nondigestible food ingredients favorable for probiotic growth, their survival in 
      the intestine is ameliorated.

TI  - [Naturopathic dietary treatment in functional disorders].
PG  - 34-6
AB  - When applied to functional disorders, dietary treatment- the most important
      measure in natural medicine - has its greatest effect when these disorders affect
      the gastrointestinal tract, in particular epigastric dyspepsia and irritable
      bowel syndrome. On the basis of a comprehensive dietary anamnesis, it is often
      possible to identify foodstuffs and eating behavior capable of aggravating the
      patient's symptoms. The underlying basic principle of treatment is that the
      gastrointestinal tract first undergo a temporary period of rest before being
      gradually re-accustomed to a biologically high-quality diet. A central approach
      includes various forms of fasting therapy, in particular in the case of severe
      conditions, which can usefully be supported by additional relaxation techniques, 
      psychotherapy, hydrotherapy, massage and special manual techniques.

TI  - Travellers' diarrhoea: contemporary approaches to therapy and prevention.
PG  - 303-14
AB  - Travellers' diarrhoea remains a major public health problem, contributing to
      significant morbidity and disability. Because bacterial enteropathogens cause a
      majority of this form of diarrhoea, antibacterial drugs are effective when used
      in chemoprophylaxis or for empirical treatment.A review of the MEDLINE listings
      for travellers' diarrhoea for the past 4 years was conducted; a library of >1,000
      scientific articles on the topic was also considered in developing this review.
      Persons who travel from industrialised countries to developing countries of the
      tropical and semi-tropical world are the individuals who experience travellers'
      diarrhoea. While diarrhoea occurs with reduced frequency among persons travelling
      to low-risk areas from other low- or other high-risk areas, and there remain
      areas of intermediate risk, this review looks primarily at the illness occurring 
      in persons from industrialised regions visiting high-risk regions of Latin
      America, Africa and Southern Asia. The material reviewed deals with the high
      frequency of acquiring diarrhoea during international travel to high-risk areas, 
      seen in approximately 40%, and the expected bacterial causes of illness, of which
      diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli is the most important. The host risk factors
      associated with increased susceptibility to diarrhoea include young age, lack of 
      previous travel to high-risk regions in the past 6 months, indiscriminate food
      and beverage selection patterns, and host genetics. It appears feasible to
      decrease the rate of illness among the travelling public by careful food and
      beverage selection or through chemoprophylaxis with nonabsorbed rifaximin.
      Chemoprophylaxis with rifaximin should help to reduce the occurrence of
      travellers' diarrhoea and hopefully prevent post-diarrhoea complications,
      including irritable bowel syndrome. Early empirical therapy with antibacterial
      drugs, including rifaximin, a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, will decrease the 
      duration of illness and return travellers more quickly to their planned
      activities.With collaboration between local governments and public health
      researchers, it may be possible to improve hygiene in areas to be visited, which 
      may translate into reduced rates of illness. More liberal use of rifaximin
      prophylaxis is likely to reduce the occurrence of illness and complications of
      disease. Vaccines and immunoprophylactic products may be beneficial for
      prevention of a subset of individuals otherwise developing diarrhoea.

TI  - Probiotics and the gastrointestinal tract: where are we in 2005?
PG  - 853-7
AB  - Probiotic agents are live microbes or components of microbes that have a positive
      effect on the host. They exert their action through interplay with the immune
      system of the host. Some of this effect is local and some is systemic. The full
      story is yet to be discovered. Probiotics have a definite positive effect on
      rotavirus diarrhea, post antibiotic diarrhea and pouchitis. Their exact role in
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, other forms of infectious
      diarrhea, and prevention of cancer is yet to be determined. This review
      summarizes the data about probiotics in these conditions.

AB  - This study comprises assessment of autonomic function in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) patients, focusing on meal-related changes. In 18 IBS patients (4 males,
      mean age 45+/-3.0 [SEM] years) and 19 healthy volunteers (6 males, mean age
      41+/-3.5 years) blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability and muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were assessed before, during and after
      consumption of a standardized meal. In pre- and postprandial phase Valsalva
      maneuver, cold pressor test (CPT) and deep breathing test were carried out and
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for nausea, bloating and pain were obtained. In 
      the IBS group, the meal induced significantly higher VAS scores for pain
      (P=0.002) and bloating (P=0.02). During food intake, the increase in blood
      pressure, heart rate and MSNA was equal in patients and controls, but the
      increase of LF/HF ratio of heart rate variability was significantly higher in the
      IBS group (median [quartiles] 2.29 [1.14-3.00] versus 0.77 [0.25-1.81]; P=0.03). 
      IBS patients scored lower on pre- and postprandial RRmax/RRmin ratio during deep 
      breathing (DB ratio, P=0.03). The increase in MSNA (burst frequency) in response 
      to CPT tended to be higher in the IBS patients (P=0.07). We conclude that
      reactivity to food intake, measured as muscle sympathetic nerve activity, is
      normal in IBS patients. The lower DB ratio and higher LF/HF ratio during food
      intake in IBS patients is an indication of a reduced parasympathetic reactivity. 
      These results suggest that reduced baseline activity as well as responsiveness of
      the parasympathetic system could play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS.

TI  - Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests.
PG  - 297-303
AB  - Hydrogen breath tests are widely used to explore the pathophysiology of
      functional gastrointestinal disorders. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and 
      carbohydrate malabsorption are disorders detected by these tests that have been
      proposed to be of great importance for symptoms in, for instance, irritable bowel
      syndrome. However, conclusions drawn from these studies are highly controversial 
      and divergent results exist. There is also an extensive use of these tests in
      clinical practice with difficulties regarding interpretation of the tests and
      sometimes erroneous conclusions. The limitations and pitfalls of these tests will
      be reviewed in this article, and hopefully the occasional abuse of these tests
      can be turned into proper clinical and scientific use instead in the future.

TI  - Systematic review: Complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel 
      syndrome.
PG  - 465-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medical therapies and practices are
      widely employed in the treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: To review 
      the usage of complementary and alternative medicine in the irritable bowel
      syndrome, and to assess critically the basis and evidence for its use. METHODS: A
      systematic review of complementary and alternative medical therapies and
      practices in the irritable bowel syndrome was performed based on literature
      obtained through a Medline search. RESULTS: A wide variety of complementary and
      alternative medical practices and therapies are commonly employed by irritable
      bowel syndrome patients both in conjunction with and in lieu of conventional
      therapies. As many of these therapies have not been subjected to controlled
      clinical trials, some, at least, of their efficacy may reflect the high-placebo
      response rate that is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome. Of those that
      have been subjected to clinical trials most have involved small poor quality
      studies. There is, however, evidence to support efficacy for hypnotherapy, some
      forms of herbal therapy and certain probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.
      CONCLUSIONS: Doctors caring for irritable bowel syndrome patients need to
      recognize the near ubiquity of complementary and alternative medical use among
      this population and the basis for its use. All complementary and alternative
      medicine is not the same and some, such as hypnotherapy, forms of herbal therapy,
      specific diets and probiotics, may well have efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome. Above all, we need more science and more controlled studies; the
      absence of truly randomized placebo-controlled trials for many of these therapies
      has limited meaningful progress in this area.

TI  - Meal induced rectosigmoid tone modification: a low caloric meal accurately
      separates functional and organic gastrointestinal disease patients.
PG  - 1409-14
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on
      arbitrary criteria due to the lack of an accurate diagnostic test. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate whether rectosigmoid tone modification after a meal
      represents an accurate diagnostic approach. METHODS: In a secondary care setting,
      32 constipation predominant and 24 diarrhoea predominant IBS patients, 10
      functional diarrhoea and 10 functional constipation patients, 29 organic
      gastrointestinal disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers underwent a rectal
      barostat test to measure fasting and postprandial rectosigmoid tone. Rectosigmoid
      response was assessed following three meals containing different amounts of
      calories: 200 kcal, 400 kcal and 1000 kcal. RESULTS: After 200 kcal, healthy
      volunteers and patients with organic diseases showed a reduction in rectosigmoid 
      volume of at least 28% of fasting volume, indicating a meal induced increase in
      muscle tone. In contrast, patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS showed dilation
      of the rectosigmoid colon, indicative of reduced tone, and patients with
      constipation predominant IBS showed a mild volume reduction or no modification.
      Functional diarrhoea and constipation patients showed rectosigmoid tone
      modification resembling that of the corresponding IBS subtype. A 400 kcal meal
      normalised rectosigmoid tone in more than half of the constipation predominant
      IBS patients but none of the diarrhoea predominant IBS patients. In contrast, a
      1000 kcal meal normalised tone response in all IBS patients. Sensitivity of the
      test was 100%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 96%, and negative
      predictive value 100%. CONCLUSION: A postprandial reduction in rectosigmoid tone 
      of at least 28% of fasting value after a low caloric meal accurately separates
      organic and functional gastrointestinal disease patients. This parameter may
      therefore be used in the positive diagnosis of IBS.

TI  - Role of partially hydrolyzed guar gum in the treatment of irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 334-42
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the world's most common gastrointestinal
      functional disorder and is associated with several social and economic costs.
      Health-related quality of life is often impaired in patients with IBS. The
      pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IBS remain poorly defined. The therapeutic
      approach to patients with IBS is based on symptoms, and fibers may play an
      important role in treatment. Among the various types of fiber, water-soluble,
      non-gelling fibers seem to be a promising option for treatment of IBS. Partially 
      hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble, non-gelling fiber that has
      provided therapeutic benefits. In clinical trials, PHGG decreased symptoms in
      constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS and decreased
      abdominal pain. Further, an improvement in quality of life was observed in
      patients with IBS during and after treatment with PHGG. Moreover, PHGG seems to
      have prebiotic properties because it increases the colonic contents of
      short-chain fatty acids, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria.

TI  - The role of fiber in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: therapeutic
      recommendations.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical condition that often presents a
      therapeutic challenge. There is no standard therapy and a multilevel approach is 
      recommended. A high-fiber diet is often one of these components. Many
      investigators have studied the effectiveness of either fiber supplementation or
      bulking agents in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this
      review is to summarize the current literature on the use of fiber in irritable
      bowel syndrome and to provide some specific recommendations. Systematic reviews
      of these trials have generally not found fiber to be significantly more effective
      than placebo at relieving global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. There may be 
      differences between results obtained with soluble and insoluble fiber. Adverse
      effects of fiber use may include abdominal discomfort and bloating. Although
      dietary fiber or bulking agents do not appear to be useful as sole treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome, they may have a limited role in empiric therapy
      depending upon the patient's symptom complex, especially if constipation is the
      most significant symptom. The basic principles for using fiber therapy are to
      start with a low dose and increase slowly, to give an adequate trial and to
      evaluate the results early and periodically.

TI  - Diet and functional gastrointestinal disorders: a population-based case-control
      study.
PG  - 2743-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet has been implicated to play a role in functional
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in clinic-based studies. No population-based
      data comparing food and nutrient consumption between individuals with FGID and
      without gastrointestinal symptoms are available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this 
      study was to compare the dietary consumption of specific food items and nutrients
      between individuals with FGID and without symptoms in a population-based sample. 
      METHODS: A validated self-report Bowel Disease Questionnaire was mailed to an
      age- and gender-stratified random sample of participants aged 20-50 yr from
      Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients who reported either FGID symptoms
      (irritable bowel or dyspepsia) or no gastrointestinal symptoms were invited to
      undergo a blinded physician interview and physical exam and to complete a
      validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and
      logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 222 of
      the 260 eligible (85%) subjects participated and 218 provided diet data: 99 were 
      FGID cases and 119 were healthy controls. Cases and controls consumed similar
      number of servings per week of wheat-containing foods, lactose-containing foods, 
      caffeinated drinks, and fructose-sweetened beverages. Cases were slightly more
      likely to consume >or=7 servings per week of norepinephrine- and
      epinephrine-containing foods (57%vs 45%, p= 0.10), but not serotonin- or
      tryptophan-containing foods. No differences were observed for amount of intake of
      calories, fiber, protein, iron, calcium, niacin, and vitamins C, D, E, niacin,
      B(1), B(2), B(6), and B(12). Cases reported consuming more fat (median, 33%vs
      31%) and less carbohydrates (median, 49%vs 52%) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: No
      differences were seen in the consumption of frequently suspected "culprit" foods 
      between community residents with and without FGID symptoms. While symptoms may be
      due to food sensitivity rather than altered diet composition, the role of fat and
      perhaps norepinephrine and epinephrine in foods in gut symptoms needs to be
      studied further.

TI  - Perceived food intolerance in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome-- etiology, 
      prevalence and consequences.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study estimates the prevalence of perceived food intolerance and
      its consequences in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), evaluates the
      utility of common tests for food intolerance, studies the relation between
      perceived food intolerance and other disorders, and discusses the etiology.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National health survey. SUBJECTS: A
      selection of the population (n=11,078) in Oppland county, Norway, was invited to 
      a health screening, and a sample of subjects with IBS were included in the study.
      INTERVENTIONS: A medical history of food intolerance, musculoskeletal pain, mood 
      disorders and abdominal complaints was taken, and tests were performed for food
      allergy and malabsorption. A dietician evaluated the dietary habits of the
      subjects. RESULTS: Out of 4,622 subjects with adequately filled-in
      questionnaires, 84 were included in the study, 59 (70%) had symptoms related to
      intake of food, 62% limited or excluded food items from the diet and 12% had an
      inadequate diet. The mean numbers of food items related to symptoms and the
      number of foods limited or excluded from the diet were 4.8 and 2.5, respectively.
      There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption
      and perceived food intolerance. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to
      musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food intolerance 
      is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population
      with IBS. The uselessness of current antibody tests and tests for malabsorption
      and the lack of correlation to psychiatric co-morbidity make the etiology
      obscure.

TI  - Probiotics. Some evidence of their effectiveness.
PG  - 1487-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the term probiotics, to indicate how to identify products
      that have been proven beneficial, and to assess the quality of evidence regarding
      probiotics. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A few level I studies support the effectiveness 
      of specific probiotics for certain diagnoses. For most so-called probiotics,
      however, weak or no evidence supports their effectiveness. MAIN MESSAGE:
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer a health benefit on the host. Level I evidence supports use of VSL#3 for
      maintaining remission of inflammatory colitis. Probiotics for treating vaginal
      infections, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, have
      level I evidence of effectiveness, but are not available in Canada. Specific
      probiotics taken for certain indications improve health and have few side
      effects. CONCLUSION: Limited but good evidence supports the role of certain
      probiotics in medical practice. Because consumer pressure will undoubtedly
      stimulate further interest in probiotics, family doctors need to be informed
      about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.

TI  - Celiac disease: evaluation of the diagnosis and dietary compliance in Canadian
      children.
PG  - e754-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as
      well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance
      with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY
      DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed
      with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac
      disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS:
      The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age
      at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms
      included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%),
      nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%).
      Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation
      of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses
      received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%),
      gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A
      serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in
      this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a
      first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported 
      strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions 
      after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5
      and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included
      abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%),
      headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although
      most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major
      disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time
      about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the
      time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. 
      More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time.
      Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate
      stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding
      gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three
      percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian
      Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent
      information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When
      asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling
      of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in
      the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier
      diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%.
      CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a
      variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common.
      Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children
      experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods
      remain difficult to obtain.

TI  - Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome patients form a heterogeneous group
      with a variable contribution of central and peripheral components. The peripheral
      component is prominent in irritable bowel syndrome developing after infection
      (post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome) and this has proved a profitable area 
      of research. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have overthrown the dogma that
      irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by no abnormality of structure by
      demonstrating low-grade lymphocytic infiltration in the gut mucosa, increased
      permeability and increases in other inflammatory components including
      enterochromaffin and mast cells. Furthermore, increased inflammatory cytokines in
      both mucosa and blood have been demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome. While
      steroid treatment has proved ineffective, preliminary studies with probiotics
      exerting an anti-inflammatory effect have shown benefit. SUMMARY: The study of
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome has revealed the importance of low-grade
      inflammation in causing irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. It has suggested novel
      approaches to irritable bowel syndrome including studies of serotonin and
      histamine metabolism which may be relevant to other subtypes of the disease.

TI  - Selective expression of histamine receptors H1R, H2R, and H4R, but not H3R, in
      the human intestinal tract.
PG  - 498-504
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Histamine is known as a regulator of gastrointestinal
      functions, such as gastric acid production, intestinal motility, and mucosal ion 
      secretion. Most of this knowledge has been obtained from animal studies. In
      contrast, in humans, expression and distribution of histamine receptors (HR)
      within the human gastrointestinal tract are unclear. METHODS: We analysed HR
      expression in human gastrointestinal tissue specimens by quantitative reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. RESULTS: We found
      that H1R, H2R, and H4R mRNA were expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract,
      while H3R mRNA was absent. No significant differences in the distribution of HR
      were found between different anatomical sites (duodenum, ileum, colon, sigma, and
      rectum). Immunostaining of neurones and nerve fibres revealed that H3R was absent
      in the human enteric nervous system; however, H1R and H2R were found on ganglion 
      cells of the myenteric plexus. Epithelial cells also expressed H1R, H2R and, to
      some extent, H4R. Intestinal fibroblasts exclusively expressed H1R while the
      muscular layers of human intestine stained positive for both H1R and H2R. Immune 
      cells expressed mRNA and protein for H1R, H2R, and low levels of H4R. Analysis of
      endoscopic biopsies from patients with food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome 
      revealed significantly elevated H1R and H2R mRNA levels compared with controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that H1R, H2R and, to some extent, H4R, are
      expressed in the human gastrointestinal tract, while H3R is absent, and we found 
      that HR expression was altered in patients with gastrointestinal diseases.

TI  - Clinical manifestations of food allergy: the old and the new.
PG  - 1287-91
AB  - Food allergies are increasing in incidence, and the variety of triggering
      antigens is widening. There is also an increased recognition of the breadth of
      immunologically mediated responses to dietary antigens; the area of
      non-IgE-mediated food allergy is belatedly acquiring scientific respectability,
      aided by improved clinical recognition and basic scientific studies. The role of 
      mucosal mast cells and eosinophils in intestinal allergic responses is now better
      recognized, and conditions such as eosinophilic oesophagitis are more prevalent
      than previously thought. However, the diagnostic difficulties of non-IgE-mediated
      allergies remain challenging.

TI  - [Food intolerance and allergy in the irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 744-9
AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a complex and heterogeneous entity that
      concerns about 1/4 of adults and would be responsible for 50% of
      gastro-enterology medical consultations. IBS etiopathogenesis and physiopathology
      are not yet fully known. Implications of food intolerance and allergy in this
      syndrome remain controversial. In this review we recall numerous mechanisms of
      allergy or food intolerance generating IBS, as well as clinical entities
      mimicking an IBS. We present a series of diagnostic tests and potential
      treatments. We finally propose a management strategy for these patients.

TI  - Travelers' diarrhea: antimicrobial therapy and chemoprevention.
PG  - 191-8; quiz 1 p following 198
AB  - The use of preventive measures and self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea is
      routine in regions where the occurrence of diarrhea is predictably high. People
      traveling to these areas who do not exercise care in their selection of consumed 
      foods and beverages will suffer high rates of illness. Such diarrhea normally
      affects the traveler for a day, although it can result in chronic postinfectious 
      irritable bowel syndrome. Although systemic antibacterial drugs are effective in 
      preventing diarrhea, their use is not routinely recommended because of side
      effects and their importance as a therapy for extra-intestinal infections. This
      review focuses on current and future uses of antibacterial drugs in the
      prevention and therapy of travelers' diarrhea. Minimally absorbed (< 0.4%)
      rifaximin can effectively reduce the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea without
      side effects. Bismuth subsalicylate is a useful alternative, although it is less 
      effective than rifaximin for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and the
      required doses are less convenient. All people who travel to high-risk areas
      should take curative antimicrobial agents with them for self-treatment of
      illness: rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, or an absorbable agent
      such as a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin taken in a single dose initially, with 
      the need for a second or third dose determined by clinical response. Loperamide
      (up to 8 mg per day for < or = 2 days) can be given with the antibiotic to offer 
      rapid symptomatic improvement. In the future, the ability to evaluate the genetic
      risk of illness acquisition might allow person-specific recommendations to be
      made.

TI  - Significance of salicylate intolerance in diseases of the lower gastrointestinal 
      tract.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced
      pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an
      organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or
      inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or
      life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local
      disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the
      characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of
      gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University.
      On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of
      chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID
      intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to
      clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.)
      including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory
      bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When
      presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these 
      symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility
      of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic,
      diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.

TI  - Food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 708-11
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common and likely a
      multifactorial gastrointestinal disorder in which a disturbed brain-gut axis has 
      been thought to have a mandatory role. Recent clinical and experimental studies
      imply that dietary factors may be more important in the pathogenesis of irritable
      bowel syndrome than was earlier anticipated. The purpose of this review is to
      present those studies and discuss their findings in relation to the crosstalk
      between the gastrointestinal immune and nervous systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Food
      elimination based on serum immunoglobulin G antibodies in irritable bowel
      syndrome has been found to result in a significant decrease in symptoms, compared
      with diets in which dietary restrictions are not guided by those antibodies. Both
      numbers of mast cells and their mediators have been shown to be increased in
      intestinal mucosa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, especially in the
      close proximity of intestinal nerves. Animal studies have demonstrated that this 
      increase in intestinal mast cell density could be a consequence of local
      hypersensitivity to food antigens. That kind of local gastrointestinal
      hypersensitivity seems to be beyond the reach of current diagnostic methods
      available in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Dietary factors may significantly
      contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. Elimination diets 
      based on the detection of local food hypersensitivity may offer a treatment
      option for irritable bowel syndrome patients in the future.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and probiotics: from rationale to clinical use.
PG  - 697-701
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Few therapies are of proven efficacy in irritable bowel
      syndrome. Thus, there is great interest in the development of a natural therapy
      that can be both safe and effective. An understanding that probiotics are
      heterogeneous, with multiple targets and mechanisms of action, is fundamental to 
      the development of clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: A bidirectional model for
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome is proposed in which gut-driven and 
      brain-driven mechanisms contribute to the genesis of gut dysfunction and
      symptoms. In-vitro and animal studies have generated most of the mechanistic
      rationale for the use of probiotics in functional bowel disorders. A MEDLINE
      search of publications from 1989 to date revealed only eight placebo-controlled
      clinical trials on the subject of probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome. All
      these studies suffer from methodologic problems. By contrast, numerous reviews
      have been published in the past 2 years on this subject. SUMMARY: Animal research
      will continue to identify novel targets and elucidate the mechanisms of action of
      probiotics, thus providing a rational basis for their use in irritable bowel
      syndrome. The notion of treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics is
      particularly attractive to patients and generates great interest, although
      clinical evidence is not yet sufficient to enable clear guidelines to be
      designed. Large, well-designed, controlled clinical trials using specific
      probiotics are warranted.

TI  - Probiotics and nutraceuticals: non-medicinal treatments of gastrointestinal
      diseases.
PG  - 596-603
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial and bioactive plant species has extended the known
      mechanism(s) of action of nutraceuticals and probiotics beyond simple nutrition
      and/or antimicrobial effects. The progressive unravelling of these plant and
      bacterial effects on systemic immune and intestinal epithelial cell function has 
      led to new credence for the use of probiotics and nutraceuticals in clinical
      medicine. Level I evidence now exists for the therapeutic use of probiotics in
      infectious diarrhea in children, recurrent Clostridium difficile-induced
      infections and post-operative pouchitis. Additional evidence is being acquired
      for the use of probiotics in other gastrointestinal infections, irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Not all individual probiotic strains
      have the same efficacy, and future clinical trials may focus on multistrain
      preparations agents with known efficacy. The use of nutraceuticals and probiotics
      as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders is rapidly moving into
      clinical usage. Scientific studies are providing mechanisms of action to explain 
      the therapeutic effects, and randomized controlled trials are providing the
      necessary evidence for their incorporation into the therapeutic armamentarium.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a probiotic combination VSL# 3 and placebo in
      irritable bowel syndrome with bloating.
PG  - 687-96
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of a combination probiotic on symptoms and colonic
      transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and significant bloating.
      METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Rome II IBS were randomized in a parallel
      group, double-blind design to placebo or VSL# 3 twice daily (31 patients received
      4 weeks and 17 patients 8 weeks of treatment). Pre- and post-treatment colonic
      transit measurements were performed using scintigraphy with (111)In charcoal.
      Symptoms were summarized as an average daily score for the entire period of
      treatment and separately for the first 4 weeks of treatment. Weekly satisfactory 
      relief of abdominal bloating was assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with VSL# 3 was
      associated with reduced flatulence over the entire treatment period (placebo 39.5
      +/- 2.6 vs VSL# 3 29.7 +/- 2.6, P = 0.011); similarly, during the first 4 weeks
      of treatment, flatulence scores were reduced (placebo 40.1 +/- 2.5 vs VSL# 3 30.8
      +/- 2.5, P = 0.014). Proportions of responders for satisfactory relief of
      bloating, stool-related symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating scores were not
      different. Colonic transit was retarded with VSL# 3 relative to placebo (colon
      geometric center 2.27 +/- 0.20 vs 2.83 +/- 0.19, P = 0.05 respectively).
      CONCLUSION: VSL# 3 reduces flatulence scores and retards colonic transit without 
      altering bowel function in patients with IBS and bloating.

TI  - An epidemiologic study of irritable bowel syndrome in adolescents and children in
      China: a school-based study.
PG  - e393-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its
      distribution characteristics of adolescents and children in China and its
      contributing factors. METHODS: This study was a stratified, randomized study by
      clustering samples, which involved 5403 students whose age range was 6 to 18
      years from 9 schools, and was conducted in Heilongjiang Province and Shanghai.
      All students studied were requested to fill in a questionnaire. IBS was diagnosed
      according to Rome II criteria. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS according to Rome
      II criteria in adolescents and children in China was 13.25%. The ratio of boys to
      girls was 1:1.8. There was a higher prevalence (14.02%) of IBS in Heilongjiang
      province than that (11.72%) in Shanghai. The prevalence in children 12 years and 
      younger was not statistically significantly higher than that of adolescents 13
      years and older (11.86% and 11.44%, respectively). The prevalence of IBS in
      minority students (21.15%) was not statistically significantly higher than that
      in Han race students (16.08%). Our study indicated that psychological factors,
      food habit, bad exterior environment, personal habits, and family conditions
      might be important contributing factors, and exposure to coldness (odds ratio:
      2.83) is most prominent. CONCLUSION: IBS was a common disorder in adolescents and
      children in China. The prevalence of IBS in adolescents and children was
      different in different geographic areas. Our study indicated that IBS in
      adolescents and children might have possible relations with psychological
      factors, food habit, bad exterior environment, and family condition.

TI  - A probiotic mixture alleviates symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a
      controlled 6-month intervention.
PG  - 387-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder of unknown
      aetiology. The effect of probiotics in this syndrome remains unclear. AIM: To
      investigate whether a probiotic mixture containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L.
      rhamnosus LC705, Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii 
      ssp. shermanii JS is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. 
      METHODS: A total of 103 patients fulfilling the Rome I or II criteria took part
      in this 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients 
      received a probiotic capsule or a placebo capsule daily. Gastrointestinal
      symptoms and bowel habits were recorded. RESULTS: At the end the total symptom
      score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + borborygmi) was 7.7 (95% CI:
      -13.9 to -1.6) points lower in the probiotic group (P = 0.015). This represents a
      median reduction of 42% in the symptom score of the probiotic group compared with
      6% in the placebo group. In individual symptoms, borborygmi was milder in the
      probiotic group (P = 0.008), and for the rest of the symptoms there was a
      non-significant trend. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this probiotic
      mixture is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.
      Considering the high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and the lack of
      effective therapies, even a slight reduction in symptoms could have positive
      public health consequences.

TI  - The use of Lactobacillus GG in irritable bowel syndrome in children: a
      double-blind randomized control trial.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral administration of the probiotic
      Lactobacillus GG under randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled conditions 
      would improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in children. STUDY
      DESIGN: Fifty children fulfilling the Rome II criteria for IBS were given
      Lactobacillus GG or placebo for 6 weeks. Response to therapy was recorded and
      collected on a weekly basis using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale
      (GSRS). RESULTS: Lactobacillus GG was not superior to placebo in relieving
      abdominal pain (40.0% response rate in the placebo group vs 44.0% in the
      Lactobacillus GG group; P=.774). There was no difference in the other
      gastrointestinal symptoms, except for a lower incidence of perceived abdominal
      distention (P=.02 favoring Lactobacillus GG). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG was
      not superior to placebo in the treatment of abdominal pain in children with IBS
      but may help relieve such symptoms as perceived abdominal distention.

TI  - [Determination of placebo effect in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 1934-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The determinants of the placebo effect are not well
      established. Goal of this study was to explore likely predictive factors in an
      already published data set. METHODS: We re-analysed data from a study in 120
      patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that were randomly assigned to
      three arms of the study to receive (double-blind) either a drug (mebeverin) (n = 
      40) or placebo (n = 40), or (in an open trial) dietary treatment (fibre) (n = 40)
      for up to 16 week. Treatment was conducted by 3 different doctors (A, B, C) with 
      44, 27, and 18 patients, resp. A fourth group (n = 31) was treated by different
      varying physicians. Symptoms were assessed every 4 weeks, and the degree of
      patient compliance and the number of drop-outs, the number of patients
      improved/not improved (in %), symptom severity (Kruis Score) at enrolment, and
      age and gender as covariates were included into the analysis. RESULTS: Drop-out
      rate was 30 % for placebo, 30 % for mebeverin, and 15 % for the diet. For the
      patients remaining in the study, average compliance was 75 % with placebo, but 89
      % for the drug and 82 % for the diet. Response rates were 39 % for placebo, but
      20 % for the drug; response rate for the diet (open trial) was 43 % under all
      doctors. Response rates for drug and placebo combined were 32 % for doctor A
      (female,43 years), but 19 % for doctors B and C together (both males, 32 and 40
      years)); this effect was not significant. Placebo responders were more often
      women (47 %) than men (28 %), while age effects were only found with dietary
      treatment: responders were younger. Placebo responders had an overall lower Kruis
      Score than non-responders (45 vs 52 points), but this was also true for drug (52 
      vs. 62 points) and diet responders (56 vs 68 points). CONCLUSION: The major
      factors contributing to the placebo response are the treating physician (gender, 
      training), and the patients gender (female). Patients with lower Kruis score
      (more likely non-functionally disordered) may be prone to higher (placebo)
      response rates.

TI  - Prescript-Assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: a
      methodologically oriented, 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      clinical study.
PG  - 755-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The symptomatic efficacy of Prescript-Assist (Safer Medical, Inc.,
      Fort Benton, Montana), a treatment combining probiotic and prebiotic components, 
      has previously been evaluated clinically only in an open-label study in patients 
      with various gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted primarily to compare the effects of
      Prescript-Assist with placebo in patients with a diagnosis of IBS. Toward this
      objective, a secondary methodologic goal was to determine the number and nature
      of symptom clusters ("subsyndromic factors") that characterize IBS. METHODS: This
      was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in which patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either Prescript-Assist one 500-mg capsule BID or 1 
      placebo capsule BID for 2 weeks. Thirteen IBS symptoms identified from the
      clinical literature were embedded in a larger research instrument. Using a scale 
      from 0 to 5, patients rated the intensity of these symptoms for the 7-day period 
      immediately before the start of treatment, at the end of each study week, and
      after each of the 2 subsequent weeks (during which all patients received
      open-label Prescript-Assist as part of a larger study evaluating methodologic
      approaches to enhancing assessments of medication efficacy/safety). The
      symptom-intensity data were subjected to maximum likelihood factor analysis with 
      varimax rotation to identify any IBS subsyndromic factors, and the effect of
      treatment on each of the identified factors was evaluated using analyses of
      covariance with appropriate baseline-week assessments as covariate controls.
      RESULTS: The study included 25 patients with IBS (23 women, 2 men; age range,
      20-70 years). Three subsyndromic factors were identified that together accounted 
      for 60.2% of total IBS symptom variance: factor 1, general ill feelings/nausea;
      factor 2, indigestion/flatulence; and factor 3, colitis. Treatment with
      Prescript-Assist was associated with significant reductions in each of the
      subsyndromic factors. Factor 1 was significantly reduced by 0.345 standard score 
      units (F(1,46) = 4.26; P = 0.042), factor 2 by 0.544 standard score units
      (F(1,46) = 7.83; P = 0.008), and factor 3 by 0.826 standard score units (F(1,46) 
      = 10.20; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 3 subsyndromic factors of
      IBS: general ill feelings/nausea, indigestion/flatulence, and colitis. In this
      methodologically oriented double-blind study in patients with IBS, combined
      probiotic-prebiotic treatment with Prescript-Assist was associated with
      significant reductions in these factors.

TI  - Probiotics as a treatment strategy for gastrointestinal diseases?
PG  - 57-68
AB  - Current interest in probiotics is motivated not only by the clinical data showing
      efficacy of some probiotic bacteria but also by the increasing antibiotic
      resistance of pathogenic bacteria (particularly in hospitals) and the rise of
      consumers' demand for natural substitutes of drugs. Only few randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled human trials are available, and some involved
      only small numbers of patients. They are difficult to compare because of
      differences in probiotic strains employed, doses and formulation. Among probiotic
      applications, reduction of diarrhea is probably the best-documented effect
      confirmed by recent meta-analyses. Literature on Helicobacter pylori indicates
      that probiotics are unable to eradicate the infection but could be useful in
      decreasing infection levels and as adjuvants of therapy-associated side effects. 
      Studies performed in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that high doses of
      probiotics and most likely a combination of different lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria are more effective in decreasing inflammatory score and
      maintaining patients in remission than a single probiotic strain. Probiotic
      studies evaluating amelioration of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome would
      require more sustained patient numbers. However, accumulated data is encouraging 
      and suggests that efficacy is strain-dependent. Finally, too few probiotic
      intervention trials have been reported on colon cancer to allow any firm
      conclusion.

TI  - Food-specific IgG4 antibody-guided exclusion diet improves symptoms and rectal
      compliance in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 800-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary modification improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). Identification of offending foods by dietary elimination/re-challenge is
      cumbersome. IgG4 antibodies to common food antigens are elevated in IBS. The aim 
      of this article was to evaluate the effect of exclusion diet based on IgG4 titres
      on IBS symptoms and rectal sensitivity and compliance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      study comprised 25 patients with IBS (3 M, 22 F, mean age 43 years, Rome II
      criteria). IgG4 titres to 16 foods (milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes,
      chicken, beef, pork, lamb, soya bean, fish, shrimps, yeast, tomatoes and peanuts)
      were measured. Foods with titres >250 microg/l were excluded for 6 months.
      Symptom severity was assessed with a previously validated questionnaire at
      baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months. Rectal compliance and sensitivity were
      measured in 12 patients at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: IgG4 antibodies to 
      milk, eggs, wheat, beef, pork and lamb were commonly elevated. Significant
      improvement was reported in pain severity (p < 0.001), pain frequency (p =
      0.034), bloating severity (p = 0.001), satisfaction with bowel habits (p = 0.004)
      and effect of IBS on life in general (p = 0.008) at 3 months. Symptom improvement
      was maintained at 6 months. Rectal compliance was significantly increased (p =
      0.011) at 6 months but the thresholds for urge to defecate/discomfort were
      unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Food-specific IgG4 antibody-guided exclusion diet
      improves symptoms in IBS and is associated with an improvement in rectal
      compliance.

TI  - The efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 in the treatment of patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome--a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      study.
PG  - 925-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: It was suggested that the intestinal microflora may play a role in
      the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics may ease symptoms 
      in IBS patients by changing gut microflora, reducing mucosal inflammation and
      exerting antibacterial effects. AIM: To assess the short- and long-term effects
      of Lactobacillus reuteri administration on clinical symptoms of IBS. METHODS:
      This is a double blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial. Subjects consumed
      1x10(8)cfu/tablet twice a day. The clinical severity of the IBS symptoms was
      evaluated by the Francis Severity score and the IBS quality-of-life score at
      study entry and then monthly. RESULTS: In total, 54 subjects were randomized for 
      treatment and 39 concluded the study. Both groups (treatment and placebo)
      improved significantly in all the studied parameters with no significant
      differences between groups. Two parameters, constipation and passing gases, were 
      marginally different between the main groups (P=0.0714 and 0.0971, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms did not improve with probiotic treatment with L.
      reuteri. A strong placebo effect and a lack of uniformity of the IBS population
      may have hindered a clearer demonstration of the effect.

TI  - Frontiers in functional dyspepsia.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Functional dyspepsia (FD) refers to unexplained pain or discomfort in the upper
      abdomen and is commonly seen in gastroenterology practice. The underlying
      pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with FD are unclear, although
      traditionally, delayed gastric emptying, visceral hypersensitivity to acid or
      mechanical distention, and impaired gastric accommodation have been implicated as
      putative physiologic disturbances. It also remains uncertain whether FD and
      irritable bowel syndrome are different presentations of the same disorder. Recent
      data on pathophysiologic mechanisms of FD have focused on postprandial motor
      disturbances (accelerated gastric emptying, antral-fundic incoordination, and
      abnormal phasic contractions), alterations of neurohormonal mechanisms in
      response to a meal, and previous acute infection. Pharmacologic therapies for FD 
      may be guided by these novel mechanisms, as current available therapeutic options
      are limited. Novel prokinetics and gastric accommodation modulators, visceral
      analgesics, and agents targeting the neurohormonal response to food ingestion are
      the next therapeutic frontiers in FD. This review summarizes traditional
      knowledge and more recent advances in the pathophysiology of FD and potential
      therapeutic opportunities.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: a concise diagnostic and pharmacological therapy
      review].
PG  - 189-97
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) usually is considered a functional
      gastrointestinal disorder characterized by pain, bloating and either diarrhea or 
      constipation, but a small subgroup of patients report a sudden onset of their IBS
      symptoms after gastroenteritis, that is named postinfectious IBS. IBS can be
      diagnosed with confidence when a patient fulfills the Rome II criteria for IBS
      and displays no warning signs, as determined by a careful history and physical
      examination. In the past numerous test were considered routine for patients with 
      suspected IBS, however, available data do not support this approach. The etiology
      of IBS remains unknown and therefore the treatment is focused on relieving
      symptoms rather than curing the disease. The patient main complaints such as
      constipation, diarrhea or bloating-pain-gas, determine the therapies of choice,
      according the severity of them.

TI  - Treatment effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum on symptoms and quality of
      life of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. A multicenter randomized open
      trial.
PG  - 1107-12
AB  - The effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) were compared in patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome, at 10 g/day (N = 40) and 5 g/day (N = 46) for 12
      weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms (GSRS), quality of life (SF-36), and
      psychological symptoms (HADS) were evaluated at baseline, during treatment
      (months 1 and 3), and at follow-up (month 6). In both groups symptoms and quality
      of life improved significantly after the first month of administration until
      follow-up compared to those at baseline. However, the improvement was
      significantly reduced at follow-up compared to the end of treatment. PHGG was
      effective for improving somatic (gastrointestinal symptoms) and psychological
      (quality of life and psychological distress) symptoms over the short term. Since 
      the improvement tended to decrease after the end of the treatment period, further
      studies should evaluate the benefits of PHGG at a maintenance dosage.

TI  - Food-specific serum IgG4 and IgE titers to common food antigens in irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1550-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Food hypersensitivity is a common perception among irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) patients. Data from dietary elimination and food challenge studies
      support an etiopathological role of diet in IBS, but there are no
      well-established tests to identify food hypersensitivity. AIM: To compare IgG4
      and IgE titers to common food antigens in IBS and controls. METHOD: One hundred
      and eight IBS [52 diarrhea-predominant (D-IBS); 32 constipation-predominant
      (C-IBS); 24 alternating (Alt-IBS)], and 43 controls were included in the study.
      IgG4 and IgE titers and skin prick testing (SPT) to 16 common foods including
      milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish,
      shrimps, soya bean, yeast, tomatoes, and peanuts were measured. RESULTS: IBS had 
      significantly higher IgG4 titers (mug/L) to wheat (395 IQR +/- 1,011 vs 0 IQR +/-
      285, p < 0.001), beef (1,079 IQR +/- 930 vs 617 IQR +/- 435, p < 0.001), pork
      (481 IQR +/- 379 vs 258 IQR +/- 496, p < 0.001), and lamb (241 IQR +/- 460 vs 167
      IQR +/- 232, p= 0.009) compared to controls. These differences were maintained
      across all three subgroups. The antibody titers to potatoes, rice, fish, chicken,
      yeast, tomato, and shrimps were not significantly different. No significant
      difference in IgE titers was observed between IBS and controls. SPT was positive 
      for only a single antigen in 5 of 56 patients tested with the same panel of
      foods. No correlation was seen between the pattern of elevated IgG4 antibody
      titers and patients' symptoms. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG4 antibodies to common foods 
      like wheat, beef, pork, and lamb are elevated in IBS patients. In keeping with
      the observation in other atopic conditions, this finding suggests the possibility
      of a similar pathophysiological role for IgG4 antibodies in IBS.

TI  - Tegaserod treatment for IBS: a model of indirect costs.
PG  - S43-50
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with substantial time lost
      from work (absenteeism) and reduced productivity at work (presenteeism), which
      are the indirect costs of illness. This article presents a productivity model
      demonstrating the indirect costs associated with IBS and the reduction in those
      costs for a cohort of female employees hypothetically treated with tegaserod, a
      new selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) type 4 (5-HT4) receptor
      agonist, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating
      women with IBS-C. The model is based on economic and epidemiologic published
      literature and clinical trial results. In this model, tegaserod treatment
      resulted in 1882 dollars in avoided lost productivity per treated female
      employee. Considering only the benefits of decreased work loss and the costs of
      medical therapy, the model predicts a benefit/cost ratio of 3.75 in the base
      case. From an employer's perspective, medical therapy for IBS with tegaserod is
      cost-effective under a series of assumptions for the treatment of women with IBS 
      with constipation.

TI  - Coeliac disease in developing countries: Middle East, India and North Africa.
PG  - 351-8
AB  - Following the application of simple serological tests for the diagnosis of
      coeliac disease (CD) in the 1980s, it gradually became clear that the prevalence 
      of CD in different countries in the Middle East, North Africa and India is almost
      the same as that in Western countries. The prevalence of CD in at-risk
      populations in these regions is reported to range between 3 and 20% and the
      prevalence in people with type 1 diabetes is approximately 3-5%. Clinical
      manifestations of CD vary markedly with age, the duration and the extent of
      disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or 
      no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as it is in Europe. Wheat has been
      the major staple food in these regions for many centuries and it is possible that
      the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some
      degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms, which are misdiagnosed as
      irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. A high index 
      of suspicion for CD should be maintained in all developing countries for patients
      who present with chronic diarrhoea or iron deficiency anaemia. The best method
      for diagnosing CD in patients with diarrhoea is the panel of coeliac serological 
      tests followed by small-bowel biopsy. In the absence of supplies for a
      gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries, maintaining this diet represents a 
      real challenge to both patients and clinicians.

TI  - [Probiotics as therapeutic agents in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 467-71
AB  - Probiotics are defined as living micro-organisms which, when administered in
      large amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. The use of probiotics in the 
      therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of
      ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies
      proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the
      course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement 
      of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota 
      and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in
      reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather
      small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always
      closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the
      effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Potential future therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: will disease modifying
      therapy as opposed to symptomatic control become a reality?
PG  - 337-54
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome can remit spontaneously, implying cure is possible.
      Predictors of good prognosis include a short history, acute onset(possibly
      postinfective origin), absence of psychological disorders, and resolution of
      chronic life stressors. Possible-disease modifying treatments with long-lasting
      effects include diet and anti-inflammatory and psychological treatments. Dietary 
      modifications, which often involve excluding dairy and wheat products, are
      successful in some patients. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been subjected to 
      one RCT in postinfective IBS without benefit. Probiotics may have benefit in
      altering bacterial flora and as anti-inflammatory agents, but further trials are 
      needed before they can be recommended. Psychological treatments may produce
      long-lasting responses. Relaxation therapy appears to have a nonspecific benefit.
      Psychotherapy has been shown to have long-term benefit and is particularly
      acceptable to, and effective for, those with overt psychological distress.
      Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in randomized placebo controlled
      trials and has a sustained effect.

TI  - The role of food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 247-55
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome patients frequently believe that food intolerances are
      to blame for many of their symptoms, although not uncommonly this is caused by
      the nonspecific increase in gut motility that occurs with food ingestion.
      Nevertheless, dietary manipulation may result in substantial improvement in IBS
      symptomatology provided it is individualized to the particular patient. By
      further understanding the mechanisms involved in dietary intolerance, it should
      be possible to optimize the benefits of this approach to treatment.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: epidemiology, natural history, health care seeking and 
      emerging risk factors.
PG  - 189-204
AB  - IBS is a common condition, affecting approximately 3% to 15% of the general
      population based on various diagnostic criteria. There seem to be differences in 
      disease epidemiology between the eastern and the western world. As data from
      larger Asian epidemiological studies begin to surface,however, such differences
      appear to be less marked. The proportion of IBS patients who consult a physician 
      for their symptoms is around 50%. Psychological factors and the presence and
      duration of abdominal pain are all significant predictors for health care
      seeking. The natural history of IBS is characterized by frequent fluctuation of
      symptoms and by an overlap with other functional GI disorders, some of which
      share a number of risk factors for IBS. Unnecessary abdominal surgery is
      performed in a high proportion of IBS sufferers. Along with the established role 
      for psychosocial conditions in IBS, other risk factors are emerging. Evidence for
      postinfectious IBS is mounting, but the clinical usefulness of characterizing
      such patients remains unclear. Food sensitivities are frequently present in IBS, 
      but more well-conducted trials of avoidance diets and desensitization are needed.
      Finally,genetic markers in IBS are an increasing focus of attention, but the
      amount of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability remains to be
      established.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) a common worldwide problem,
      particularly women, and presents from the teenage years onward. OBJECTIVE: This
      article discusses the causes, diagnosis and management of IBS. DISCUSSION:
      Disturbed motility and sensory function underlie much of the disturbance in
      function that, not infrequently, begins following an episode of gastroenteritis. 
      There is an intimate role for the brain-gut axis in modulating symptoms relating 
      to underlying causes of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, food intolerance and
      sensitivity, and abnormalities of corticotropin releasing factors. Management
      requires long term involvement with the patient as there is no single therapeutic
      strategy that is predictably effective. However, diet, bulking agents,
      antispasmodics and a variety of alternative therapies including herbs,
      probiotics, and psychological intervention are important in individual patients.

TI  - Bulking agents, antispasmodic and antidepressant medication for the treatment of 
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - CD003460
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health problem, often
      presenting in primary care as well as in internal medicine and gastroenterology
      outpatient clinics. Therapeutic options are dominated by drug therapies but there
      is uncertainty about their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of
      this review was to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodic and
      antidepressant medication for the treatment of IBS. SEARCH STRATEGY: A computer
      assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and the Cochrane Library was
      performed for the years 1966-2001; local and national databases were searched in 
      10 European countries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing bulking
      agents, antispasmodic or antidepressant medications with a placebo, in IBS
      patients over 12 years of age. Only studies published as a full paper were
      included. No language criterion was applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The
      search identified 687 studies, 66 of which fulfilled all eligibility criteria.
      After removal of cross-over studies that did not report separately on the first
      phase, data from 40 studies remained for analysis. Relative risk (RR), risk
      difference (RD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence 
      intervals were calculated for all subgroups. The number needed to treat (NNT) was
      also calculated where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one study reports from 40 
      studies, comprising 78 comparisons, were analysed. These included 11 reports on
      bulking agents, 6 on antidepressants, and 24 on spasmolytics.BULKING AGENTS:
      Three studies comprising 159 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief
      of abdominal pain. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.22 (95% CI
      0.86 - 1.73). Three studies comprising 128 patients reported a continuous outcome
      for relief of abdominal pain. Using the random effects model, the SMD was 0.68
      (95% CI -0.86 - 2.33). Nine studies comprising 482 patients reported a
      dichotomous outcome for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR was 1.09 
      (95% CI 0.78 - 1.50). Five studies comprising 253 patients reported a dichotomous
      outcome for improvement of symptom score. The pooled RR using a random effects
      model was 0.93 (95% CI 0.56 - 1.54). Two studies comprising 70 patients reported 
      a continuous outcome for improvement of symptom score; the SMD using a fixed
      effects model was -0.44 (95% CI -1.20 - 0.31). SPASMOLYTIC AGENTS: Eleven studies
      comprising 1260 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal
      pain. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 - 1.59;
      RD=0.17, 95% CI 0.06 -0.28; NNT=6, 95% CI 4 - 15). Seven studies comprising 467
      patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using a
      fixed effects model the pooled SMD was -0.65 (95% CI -0.94 to -0.35). Sixteen
      studies comprising 1236 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for global
      assessment of improvement. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.42
      (95% CI 1.17 - 1.72; RD=0.20, 95% CI 0.09 -0.30; NNT=5, 95% CI 3 - 11). One study
      comprising 34 patients reported a dichotomous variable for improvement of symptom
      score. The RR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.96 - 1.85). Three studies reported a continuous 
      outcome for improvement of symptom score; two studies comprising 66 patients
      could be pooled. Using a fixed effects model, the SMD was -0.37 (95% CI -0.85 -
      0.12). ANTIDEPRESSANTS: Two studies comprising 81 patients reported a dichotomous
      outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using the random effects model, the pooled 
      RR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.33 - 2.12). Two studies comprising 101 patients reported a 
      continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The SMD using a random effects
      model was -0.53 (95% CI -2.29 - 1.23). Four studies comprising 241 patients
      reported a dichotomous variable for global assessment of improvement. The pooled 
      RR was 1.16 (95% CI 0.78 - 1.73). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for efficacy
      of drug therapies for IBS is weak. Although there is evidence of benefit for
      antispasmodic drugs for abdominal pain and global assessment of symptoms; it is
      unclear whether anti-spasmodic subgroups are individually effective. There is no 
      clear evidence of benefit for antidepressants or bulking agents. The physician
      should be aware that global assessment is a construct containing various
      dimensions. For each individual, these will have a different weighting and
      treatment should be aimed at the most debilitating symptom. Stool problems are by
      definition part of the IBS symptom complex. Bulking agents may improve
      constipation and can be used empirically, but should be evaluated at an early
      stage for individual benefit. Future research should pay attention to study
      methodology and the use of valid outcome measures.

TI  - Do interventions which reduce colonic bacterial fermentation improve symptoms of 
      irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 758-66
AB  - Abnormal fermentation may be an important factor in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). Gastroenteritis or antibiotic therapy may damage the colonic microflora,
      leading to increased fermentation and the accumulation of gas. Gas excretion may 
      be measured by whole-body calorimetry but there has only been one such study on
      IBS to date. We aimed to assess the relationship between IBS symptoms and
      fermentation rates in IBS. A purpose-built, 1.4-m3, whole-body calorimeter was
      used to assess excretion of H2 and CH4 in IBS subjects while consuming a standard
      diet and, again, after open randomization on either the standard diet together
      with the antibiotic metronidazole or a fiber-free diet to reduce fermentation.
      Metronidazole significantly reduced the 24-hr excretion of hydrogen (median value
      compared to the control group, 397 vs 230 ml/24 hr) and total gas (H2 + CH4; 671 
      vs 422 ml/min) and the maximum rate of gas excretion (1.6 vs 0.8 ml/min), as did 
      a no-fiber polymeric diet (hydrogen, 418 vs 176 ml/min; total gas, 564 vs 205
      ml/min; maximum rate of gas excretion, 1.35 vs 0.45 ml/min), with a significant
      improvement in abdominal symptoms. IBS may be associated with rapid excretion of 
      gaseous products of fermentation, whose reduction may improve symptoms.

TI  - Use of diet and probiotic therapy in the irritable bowel syndrome: analysis of
      the literature.
PG  - S243-6
AB  - GOAL: The goal of this report is to review the use of dietary intake and
      probiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in published reports. 
      BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can be important in inducing symptoms that occur in
      patients with the IBS. Dietary intolerances, dietary allergies, specific food
      metabolites, and regular diet contents all may act as triggers and aggravate the 
      symptoms of IBS; but when any of these mechanisms can be proven to cause the
      symptoms, then their elimination results in the resolution of that patient's IBS.
      METHODS: Our previous review was updated. In addition, a careful Medline search
      was made for the years from 1975 to 2004 to evaluate human research reports on
      diet and probiotics in the IBS. Forty-six manuscripts were reviewed on diet and
      six were available on probiotic use in IBS. The most common dietary factor
      evaluated in the literature was bran, and the most common probiotic used was
      Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSIONS: Although investigations have shown that
      bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does
      not reveal conclusive evidence that diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the
      limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing
      symptoms. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both
      dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.

TI  - Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in irritable bowel syndrome: symptom responses 
      and relationship to cytokine profiles.
PG  - 541-51
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the response of symptoms 
      and cytokine ratios in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with ingestion of probiotic
      preparations containing a lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strain. METHODS:
      Seventy-seven subjects with IBS were randomized to receive either Lactobacillus
      salivarius UCC4331 or Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, each in a dose of 1 x 10 10
      live bacterial cells in a malted milk drink, or the malted milk drink alone as
      placebo for 8 weeks. The cardinal symptoms of IBS were recorded on a daily basis 
      and assessed each week. Quality of life assessment, stool microbiologic studies, 
      and blood sampling for estimation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell release of
      the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 were performed at the beginning and
      at the end of the treatment phase. RESULTS: For all symptoms, with the exception 
      of bowel movement frequency and consistency, those randomized to B infantis 35624
      experienced a greater reduction in symptom scores; composite and individual
      scores for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and bowel movement
      difficulty were significantly lower than for placebo for those randomized to B
      infantis 35624 for most weeks of the treatment phase. At baseline, patients with 
      IBS demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, indicative of a proinflammatory, 
      Th-1 state. This ratio was normalized by B infantis 35624 feeding alone.
      CONCLUSIONS: B infantis 35624 alleviates symptoms in IBS; this symptomatic
      response was associated with normalization of the ratio of an anti-inflammatory
      to a proinflammatory cytokine, suggesting an immune-modulating role for this
      organism, in this disorder.

TI  - Evaluation of mucosal eosinophils in the pediatric colon.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - To evaluate the clinical significance of colonic eosinophilia, we conducted a
      retrospective study of all children older than 1 year evaluated at Children's
      Hospital of Pittsburgh from January 1999 to June 2001 with a description of
      colonic eosinophilia in the pathology report. Medical records were reviewed.
      Diagnoses were confirmed by contacting the patients. Histological slides (H&E)
      were reviewed by an investigator blind to the patients' data. Biopsies were
      grouped according to the site they were taken from and then screened at low power
      for areas of maximal eosinophilia for further quantitative analysis. Results of
      manual counts were validated by image analysis using Metaphor Image Analysis
      Software. Sixty-nine children with colonic eosinophilia were identified (36 male;
      mean age, 135.2 +/- 55.4 months). Their final diagnoses were inflammatory bowel
      disease in 32% (group A), irritable bowel syndrome in 33% (group B), food
      allergies in 10% (group C), and other diagnoses in 25% (group D). The maximal
      eosinophil count per crypt area was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in group A vs
      groups B, C, and D (34.8 +/- 17.1 vs 21.3 +/- 8.8, 25.4 +/- 16.7, and 24.2 +/-
      9.7, respectively). The total cellularity of the lamina propria was considered
      high only in group A (P < 0.05 vs groups B and C). A mostly equal vertical
      distribution of eosinophils throughout the lamina propria was found significantly
      more frequently in group A vs groups C (P = 0.04) and D (P = 0.007). We conclude 
      that children with inflammatory bowel disease have an equal distribution of
      eosinophils throughout the lamina propria, with intraepithelial and intracryptal 
      eosinophils and with a higher overall total cellularity. In irritable bowel
      syndrome and patients with a variety of other diagnoses, including allergies, the
      distribution is mostly superficial, with a lower total cellularity.

TI  - Randomised-controlled trial of a fibre supplement on the symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of coarse wheat bran on specific
      bowel function parameters and symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS). A longitudinal, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was
      undertaken. The duration of treatment was eight to 12 weeks and this consisted of
      10-20 g/day of coarse wheat bran or a low fibre placebo taken in addition to the 
      normal diet. Twenty-eight outpatients fulfilling the Rome criteria for
      constipation-predominant IBS were recruited to the trial (14 in the treatment
      group; 14 in the placebo group). Twelve people completed the trial in the
      treatment group and ten in the placebo group. The main outcome measures included 
      changes in symptoms recorded in a diary, changes in objective measurements of
      bowel function and subjective overall feelings of improvement. The bran group
      significantly increased their non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) intake over that of
      the placebo group (p < 0.05). Mean stool wet weight increased significantly more 
      in the bran group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05), but other bowel function 
      measurements and all recorded symptoms were not different. Many patients reported
      changes in bowel habit that were not reflected in the objective measurements. The
      addition of coarse wheat bran to the diet increased NSP ingestion and stool wet
      weight in this group of IBS patients, but no evidence was obtained that such
      treatment was of benefit to these patients, other than a placebo effect on
      symptoms.

TI  - A non-dairy probiotic's (poi) influence on changing the gastrointestinal tract's 
      microflora environment.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora
      adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are 
      probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts
      confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain
      health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a
      Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro
      plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of
      poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the
      gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study
      included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and
      control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week
      washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 
      4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as 
      their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed
      fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2
      cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary
      records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and
      post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no
      significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus
      following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of
      specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is
      analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not
      alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet
      feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus,
      Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency
      or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods.
      CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual
      bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might
      determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2
      days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations
      may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.

TI  - The Incidence of self-prescribed oral complementary and alternative medicine use 
      by patients with gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 138-41
AB  - GOALS: To assess the incidence of oral complementary and alternative medicine
      (CAM) usage by gastroenterology patients at a single university center and
      compare against controls. BACKGROUND: The public awareness and usage of CAM have 
      increased. The use of CAM has been described in patients with functional bowel
      disorders; however, their role in patients with gastrointestinal disease is less 
      clear. STUDY: Patients attending luminal gastroenterology clinics and customers
      at local supermarkets completed a 30-point, structured questionnaire assessing
      their use of CAM. RESULTS: A total of 1,409 subjects were recruited. The
      incidence of CAM use was 49.5% for inflammatory bowel disease, 50.9% for
      irritable bowel syndrome, 20% for general gastrointestinal diseases, and 27% for 
      controls. Pearson's chi(2) tests showed that patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome were more likely to use CAM than
      controls (P < 0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that females
      were more likely to take CAM than men (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of 
      CAM users among patients with IBD is similar to those with a functional
      diagnosis. Increasing numbers of IBD patients are using CAM in addition to
      conventional therapy. Awareness of this may prevent adverse CAM and conventional 
      drug interactions.

TI  - The perceived effect of various foods and beverages on stool consistency.
PG  - 109-12
AB  - AIM: Some people believe that chocolate and other foods or beverages may cause
      constipation. This study was undertaken to quantify the effect of potentially
      constipating foods and beverages on apparently healthy and constipated
      populations of German individuals. METHODS: A questionnaire asking for the effect
      of certain foods and beverages on stool form (perceived consistency) was answered
      by 200 healthy controls, 122 patients with chronic constipation, and 766 patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). RESULTS: Patients with
      constipation or IBS-C reported altered stool form after food and beverage
      consumption more often than controls (controls 42.5% vs constipation 52.0% vs
      IBS-C 57.0%, P < 0.001). Controls experienced hardening of stools less often and 
      experienced softening more often than either constipation or IBS-C patients. When
      patients were asked which foods or beverages caused constipation (open ended
      question), chocolate was most frequently mentioned, followed by white bread and
      bananas. The results of systematic questioning yielded chocolate (48-64% of
      respondents), bananas (29-48%), and black tea (14-24%) as constipating, while
      prunes (41-52%), coffee (14-24%), wine (8-30%), beer (14-24%), and smoking
      (42-70% in those who smoked) were considered stool softeners. CONCLUSION: Several
      foodstuffs may exert an effect on stool consistency. Chocolate, bananas and black
      tea are perceived to cause constipation, while prunes are perceived to soften
      stools in many people. Coffee, wine and beer were perceived to soften stools in a
      minority of people. Cigarettes are perceived to soften stools by about half of
      the smokers.

TI  - Probiotics and gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 78-92
AB  - There is increasing evidence indicating health benefits by consumption of foods
      containing microorganisms, i.e. probiotics. A number of clinical trials have been
      performed to evaluate the effects in the prevention and treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms or by disturbances 
      in the normal microflora. Gastrointestinal infections caused by Helicobacter
      pylori, traveller's diarrhoea, rotavirus diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhoea are conditions that
      have been studied. There are also studies performed on the preventive effect of
      probiotics on radiation-induced diarrhoea and diarrhoea in tube-fed patients.
      Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, two idiopathic
      conditions where alterations in the normal microflora have been implicated as
      responsible for initiation, are two further areas where the use of probiotics has
      been regarded as promising. The results from clinical studies have not been
      conclusive in that the effects of probiotics have been strain-dependent and
      different study designs have been used. Treatment of acute diarrhoea in children 
      and prevention of AAD are the two most justified areas for the application of
      probiotics.
