AB  - Symptoms of IBS are very prevalent. One quarter of symptomatic individuals
      present for medical care because of symptom severity and psychologic factors. The
      pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial, involving abnormalities in the gut, immune
      system, enteric sensory and motor nerves, and the CNS. IBS is diagnosed by
      symptomatology according to the Rome criteria and the absence of alarm findings
      suggestive of organic disease. Minimal testing is advocated to confirm the
      diagnosis in patients presenting with typical symptoms. Therapy is based on the
      dominant symptom (IBS subtype). Therapeutic options include dietary
      modifications, counseling, medications, and psychologic treatments. Novel
      therapies are being investigated to correct potentially pathogenetic peripheral
      and CNS abnormalities in IBS.

TI  - When fiber is not enough: current thinking on constipation management.
PG  - 30-41
AB  - Constipation is a common disorder and many patients fail to respond to the simple
      constipation remedies of increased fiber and fluid intake. When secondary to
      other conditions, medications, or disease processes, the focus of constipation
      management is correction of causative factors. However, primary constipation -
      ie, constipation with no identifiable causative factor - is very common. Patients
      generally present with one of three patterns: constipation-predominant irritable 
      bowel syndrome, slow transit constipation, or pelvic floor dysfunction resulting 
      in dyssynergic defecation. Baseline evaluation for patients with chronic
      constipation includes a careful history, focused physical examination, and
      limited laboratory studies. Patients with dyssynergic defecation usually respond 
      best to biofeedback therapy and pelvic muscle re-education.
      Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is best managed with dietary
      monitoring and modifications, fiber therapy, and education regarding
      self-monitoring and self-care. Patients with slow transit constipation may
      benefit from fiber therapy and increased activity, but most also will require
      laxative therapy. Current guidelines for prescribing laxatives suggest bulk
      agents as first line and osmotic agents as second line therapy. Stimulant
      laxatives should generally be reserved for PRN use. Current understanding about
      the etiology, pathology, and classification of different types of constipation
      are summarized and a stepwise approach to evaluation and management is presented.

TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on colonic fermentation and symptoms of
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 2615-20
AB  - A number of recent clinical trials have promoted the use of probiotic bacteria as
      a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The recent demonstration of
      abnormal colonic fermentation in some patients with this condition provides an
      opportunity for the objective assessment of the therapeutic value of these
      bacteria. This study was designed to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus
      plantarum 299V on colonic fermentation. We conducted a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over, four-week trial of Lactobacillus plantarum 299V
      in 12 previously untreated patients with IBS. Symptoms were assessed daily by a
      validated composite score and fermentation by 24-hr indirect calorimetry in a
      1.4-m3 canopy followed by breath hydrogen determination for 3 hr after 20 ml of
      lactulose. On placebo, the median symptom score was 8.5 [6.25-11.25 interquartile
      range (IQR)], the median maximum rate of gas production was 0.55 ml/min (0.4-1.1 
      IQR), and the median hydrogen production was 189.7 ml/24 hr (118.3-291.1 IQR). On
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299V the median symptom score was 8 (6.75-13.5 IQR), the 
      median maximum rate of gas production 0.92 ml/min (0.45-1.5 IQR), and the median 
      hydrogen production 208.2 ml/24 hr (146-350.9 IQR). There was no significant
      difference. Breath hydrogen excretion after lactulose was reduced by the
      probiotic (median at 120 min, 6 ppm; placebo, 17 ppm; P = 0.019). In conclusion, 
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299V in this study did not appear to alter colonic
      fermentation or improve symptoms in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Role of food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 403-12
AB  - A significant proportion of IBS patients attribute their symptoms to adverse food
      reactions. Dietary elimination and re-challenge studies support the role of diet 
      in the pathogenesis of IBS. The aetiopathogenesis of IBS is thought to be
      multifactorial involving an interaction between diet, infection, antibiotics and 
      psychosocial factors. Serum IgE and IgG4 antibodies are elevated in food
      hypersensitivity induced atopic conditions and a similar mechanism has been
      postulated in IBS. Increased number of mast cells is present in the ileocaecal
      region of IBS patients. Once sensitized, they are capable of inducing secretory
      and sensorimotor abnormalities of the gut. The management of IBS is usually aimed
      at controlling symptoms, however, evaluation of food hypersensitivity may provide
      a useful adjunct in those with severe symptoms or a clear history of adverse food
      reaction. There are no well-established tests available but skin prick tests and 
      food specific serum IgG4 and IgE antibodies may help in identifying the offending
      foods. Other options, which may be explored in individual cases, include
      sequential dietary exclusion, use of hypoallergenic diets, disodium cromoglycate 
      and novel techniques such as colonoscopic allergen provocation test.
      Pathophysiology of hypersensitivity induced IBS has been discussed in the light
      of current data and a management algorithm has been proposed for managing food
      hypersensitivity in IBS.

TI  - Intestinal microflora and oral bacteriotherapy in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - S48-53
AB  - On the basis of many clinical and experimental observations, it would appear
      feasible to hold that the characteristics of the luminal milieu, the
      relationship, the balance between luminal prokaryotic cells and mucosal
      eukaryotic cells and the consequent immunological and humoral local and systemic 
      responses take part in the pathophysiology of several diseases and, consequently 
      bacteriotherapy can play a relevant role in the treatment and prevention of
      irritable bowel syndrome and more in general, of the intestinal functional
      disorders. The irritable bowel syndrome is characterised by sudden and
      unforeseeable changes in the two main symptoms, constipation and diarrhoea, even 
      within a few days. The amount and composition of proximal colon microflora,
      increasing with regard to the above-mentioned factors, and the time in which this
      development occurs, are, in our opinion, elements taking part, together with
      colon dysmotility and alterations of visceral perception, in the onset of the
      variability in stool frequency, typical of these patients. The present open
      noncontrolled trial is the first observation showing a clinical improvement
      related to changes in the composition of the faecal bacterial flora and in faecal
      biochemistry and, remarkably, in the colonic motility pattern, all of which
      induced by administration of probiotics, in patients with functional diarrhoea.

TI  - Probiotics in the third millennium.
PG  - S2-7
AB  - Probiotics are "living microorganisms which upon ingestion in certain numbers
      exert health benefits beyond inherent general nutrition". Since 1987, when the
      first publication on the properties of the Lactobacillus GG was done, overall,
      there have been over 200 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. This 
      paper will report the status and the prospectus of probiotics research at the
      beginning of the Third Millennium. Probiotics have proven benefits in treatment
      and prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea in children and reduction of
      antibiotic-associated intestinal side-effects. Interesting results have recently 
      been published regarding food allergies and atopic eczema in children. Prevention
      of vaginitis and of travellers' diarrhoea have also been reported. Promising
      results are being reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, cystic
      fibrosis, dental caries and irritable bowel syndrome. It has also been suggested 
      that probiotics could enhance oral vaccine administration, and that they may help
      treatment against Helicobacter pylori infection, but further studies are needed. 
      Future areas of research regard probiotics' role in the process of
      carcinogenesis, given their influence on the gut microflora, and as immune
      modulators in autoimmune disorders. The possibility of introducing appropriate
      genes to the probiotics to make them produce various compounds is also under
      investigation. However, there is still confusion in the minds of the authorities 
      over whether a probiotic is a drug, a food, or a dietary supplement. The
      challenge is to continue research to define the appropriate uses of probiotics
      and discover new applications which will bring benefit to humankind.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of tegaserod, a serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor partial
      agonist with promotile activity.
PG  - 1021-42
AB  - Tegaserod, a selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 5-HT(4) receptor
      partial agonist, is indicated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who
      identify abdominal pain or discomfort and constipation as their predominant
      symptoms. Tegaserod at dosages of 1 to 12 mg/day exerts pharmacodynamic actions
      in the upper and the lower gastrointestinal tract, accelerating small bowel and
      colonic transit in patients with IBS. Tegaserod is rapidly absorbed following
      oral administration; peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) are reached after
      approximately 1 hour. Absolute bioavailability is about 10% under fasted
      conditions. Food reduces the bioavailability of tegaserod by 40 to 65% and the
      C(max) by 20 to 40%. Systemic exposure to tegaserod is not significantly altered 
      at neutral gastric pH compared with the fasted state (pH 2). Tegaserod is
      approximately 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha(1)-acid
      glycoprotein, and has a volume of distribution at steady-state of 368 +/- 223L.
      Tegaserod is metabolised mainly via two pathways. The first is a presystemic
      acid-catalysed hydrolysis in the stomach followed by oxidation and conjugation
      which produces the main metabolite of tegaserod, 5-methoxyindole-3-carboxylic
      acid glucuronide (M 29.0). This metabolite has negligible affinity for 5-HT(4)
      receptors and is devoid of promotile activity. The second is direct
      glucuronidation which leads to generation of three isomeric N-glucuronides. The
      plasma clearance of tegaserod is 77 +/- 15 L/h, with an estimated terminal
      half-life of 11 +/- 5 hours following intravenous administration. Approximately
      two-thirds of the orally administered dose of tegaserod is excreted unchanged in 
      faeces, with the remainder excreted in urine, primarily as M 29.0. The
      pharmacokinetics of tegaserod are dose-proportional over the range 2 to 12mg
      given twice daily for 5 days, with no relevant accumulation. The pharmacokinetics
      of tegaserod in patients with IBS are comparable to those in healthy individuals,
      and similar between men and women. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly
      patients or those with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment. Tegaserod
      should not be used in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. No
      clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with tegaserod have been identified.
      In vivo drug-drug interaction studies with theophylline [a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      1A2 prototype substrate], dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 prototype substrate),
      digoxin, warfarin and oral contraceptives have indicated no clinically relevant
      interactions and no requirement for dosage adjustment.

TI  - [Probiotics: history, definition, requirements and possible therapeutic
      applications].
PG  - 157-65
AB  - The ingestion of probiotics is associated with various beneficial effects on
      human health and modifies the physiological homeostasis of the intestinal flora. 
      Probiotics are microorganisms with some particular characteristics: human origin,
      safety in human use, bile and acid resistance, survival in the intestine, at
      least temporary colonization of the human gut, adhesion to the mucosa and
      bacteriocine production. Thanks to these characteristics, probiotics block the
      invasion of human intestinal cells by the enteroinvasive bacteria. Furthermore,
      they should be able to stimulate and modulate the intestinal immune response, and
      to protect and stabilize the mucosal barrier. Finally, the efficacy of probiotics
      should be evident and documented with valid studies. All their properties should 
      be maintained during processing and storage. Probiotics are usually used to
      protect the host from pathogens. With regard to this, they are useful in the
      prevention of antibiotic and traveler's diarrhea and they may play a role in the 
      management of gastric Helicobacter pylori infection. Furthermore, their efficacy 
      in the treatment of infectious diarrhea, in inflammatory bowel diseases, in
      pouchitis and in food allergy has been shown. Probiotics can improve the symptoms
      of irritable bowel syndrome and of lactose malabsorption. Finally, it has been
      suggested that such microorganisms may play a role in the prevention of
      carcinogenesis and of tumor growth.

TI  - Gastrointestinal melatonin: localization, function, and clinical relevance.
PG  - 2336-48
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of vertebrate species is a rich source of extrapineal 
      melatonin. The concentration of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tissues
      surpasses blood levels by 10-100 times and there is at least 400x more melatonin 
      in the gastrointestinal tract than in the pineal gland. The gastrointestinal
      tract contributes significantly to circulating concentrations of melatonin,
      especially during the daytime and melatonin may serve as an endocrine, paracrine,
      or autocrine hormone influencing the regeneration and function of epithelium,
      enhancing the immune system of the gut, and reducing the tone of gastrointestinal
      muscles. As binding sites for melatonin exhibit circadian variation in various
      species, it has been hypothesized that some melatonin found in the
      gastrointestinal tract might be of pineal origin. Unlike the photoperiodically
      regulated production of melatonin in the pineal, the release of gastrointestinal 
      melatonin seems to be related to the periodicity of food intake.
      Phylogenetically, melatonin and its binding sites were detected in the
      gastrointestinal tract of lower vertebrates, birds, and mammals. Melatonin was
      found also in large quantities in the embryonic tissue of the mammalian and avian
      gastrointestinal tract. Food intake and, paradoxically, also longterm food
      deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue and plasma concentrations of
      melatonin. Melatonin release may have a direct effect on many gastrointestinal
      tissues but may also well influence the digestive tract indirectly, via the
      central nervous system and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin 
      prevents ulcerations of gastrointestinal mucosa by an antioxidant action,
      reduction of secretion of hydrochloric acid, stimulation of the immune system,
      fostering epithelial regeneration, and increasing microcirculation. Because of
      its unique properties, melatonin could be considered for prevention or treatment 
      of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers, irritable bowel
      syndrome, and childhood colic.

TI  - Abnormalities of GI transit in bloated irritable bowel syndrome: effect of bran
      on transit and symptoms.
PG  - 2315-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bloating is an important but poorly understood symptom in irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) that is often aggravated by bran. The aim of our study was
      to determine whether IBS patients with bloating responded to bran differently
      from healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 12 patients with IBS (according to
      Rome I criteria), all with moderate to severe bloating, and 12 healthy controls
      participated in a two way, double blind, randomized, cross-over trial of bran
      versus placebo (crushed biscuits) 15 g b.i.d. An average daily pain index and
      bloating score were derived from daily symptom diaries. On day 14, gastric
      emptying, small bowel transit, percent remaining in ascending colon, and
      geometric center of a meal marker at 24 h were calculated from scintigraphic
      images obtained after ingesting a Tc99m-labeled rice pudding meal with 15 g of
      either placebo or coarse bran. RESULTS: Results are given as median (range). Bran
      significantly increased the pain index and bloating (p < 0.02) in IBS patients
      but not controls. The most striking finding was that the small bowel transit time
      of the meal without bran was markedly faster in IBS patients than in controls,
      being 203 min (range 109-313) versus 367 min (219-543), p < 0.001. Although in
      controls bran accelerated small bowel transit time to 262 min (180-380), p =
      0.03, and significantly reduced % remaining in the ascending colon from 22%
      (0-46) to 3% (0-25), p = 0.03, this was not seen in the IBS patients. Bran
      accelerated whole gut transit as assessed by geometric center at 24 h in both IBS
      patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Bran accelerates small bowel transit and
      ascending colon clearance without causing symptoms in controls. Small bowel
      transit is rapid in IBS patients with bloating and, unlike in healthy control
      subjects, cannot be further accelerated by bran, which nevertheless aggravates
      symptoms of pain and bloating. We speculate that bran-induced bloating may
      originate in the colon rather than the small bowel.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: a little understood organic bowel disease?
PG  - 555-64
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome affects 10% of adults with an unexplained female
      predominance. Although only a few people see their family doctor, the disease
      causes reduced quality of life and represents a multi-billion pound health-care
      problem. The disorder clusters in families, which is possibly because of
      intra-familial learning and a genetic predisposition. Visceral hypersensitivity
      is a key feature in most patients. Results of imaging studies of regional
      cerebral blood flow during rectal distension suggest underlying disturbances of
      central processing of afferent signals, though this is not unique to the
      disorder, since it is seen in other chronic pain syndromes. Environmental factors
      that are strongly implicated in at least some patients include gastrointestinal
      infection and inflammation and chronic stress. Diagnosis is based on positive
      symptoms and absence of any alarm indicators. Treatment remains unsatisfactory
      and hinges on an excellent doctor-patient relationship, with drugs for symptom
      exacerbations. Cognitive behavioural treatment, psychotherapy, and hypnosis could
      provide long-lasting benefit in some patients. Tricyclic antidepressants in low
      doses seem to be the most effective class of drugs for the disorder on the basis 
      of limited data.

TI  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis.
PG  - 366-72
AB  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare gastrointestinal (GI) disorder of
      undetermined cause characterized by infiltration of eosinophils in the GI tract. 
      Eosinophils accumulate in tissues and may release highly cytotoxic granular
      proteins, which cause severe tissue damage characteristic of eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis. Eotaxin may play a role in the recruitment of eosinophils into
      tissue in combination with chemoattractants and cytokines, including interleukin 
      3 and 5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Food allergy,
      especially in children, can be a triggering factor, and an amino acid-based diet 
      may be helpful. Accumulation of eosinophils in the gut is a common feature in
      food-induced GI disorders that can be regulated through a complex molecular
      network involving Th2 cells, various cytokines, and chemokines. Eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation depending on the
      site of involvement. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome or
      dyspepsia and, rarely, mimics pancreatitis or appendicitis. Diagnosis is
      important and is usually made by a pathologist. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a
      treatable disease; patients generally respond to steroid therapy, although
      relapse is common. Non-enteric-coated budesonide, a locally acting corticosteroid
      with little risk of adrenal suppression, may be substituted, although more
      experience is needed. Promising new drugs for eosinophilic gastroenteritis
      include montelukast, a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, and suplaplast 
      tosilate, a selective Th2 cytokine inhibitor with inhibitory effects on
      allergy-induced eosinophilic infiltration and IgE production. Although it is
      likely a separate disease, more experience has accumulated, and an elimination or
      specific amino acid-based diet appears to be helpful in treatment.

TI  - Probiotics and intestinal health effects: a clinical perspective.
PG  - S51-7
AB  - Probiotics are viable non-pathogenic micro-organisms which, when ingested, exert 
      a positive influence on host health or physiology. We have critically analysed
      the evidence for the efficacy of specific probiotic strains in human
      gastrointestinal diseases. The best evidence can be obtained with randomised
      controlled trials which avoid bias. Good evidence has been obtained with several 
      strains in the prevention or treatment of antibiotic-associated disorders, in the
      treatment (and to a lesser extent prevention) of gastroenteritis and acute
      diarrhoea and in the alleviation of lactose intolerance. We also analysed the
      recent randomised controlled trials performed in patients with Clostridium
      difficile or Helicobacter pylori, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia and colon cancer.

      effects of probiotics.
PG  - S67-72
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multi-factorial gastrointestinal condition
      affecting 8-22 % of the population with a higher prevalence in women and
      accounting for 20-50 % of referrals to gastroenterology clinics. It is
      characterised by abdominal pain, excessive flatus, variable bowel habit and
      abdominal bloating for which there is no evidence of detectable organic disease. 
      Suggested aetiologies include gut motility and psychological disorders,
      psychophysiological phenomena and colonic malfermentation. The faecal microflora 
      in IBS has been shown to be abnormal with higher numbers of facultative organisms
      and low numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Although there is no evidence
      of food allergy in IBS, food intolerance has been identified and exclusion diets 
      are beneficial to many IBS patients. Food intolerance may be due to abnormal
      fermentation of food residues in the colon, as a result of disruption of the
      normal flora. The role of probiotics in IBS has not been clearly defined. Some
      studies have shown improvements in pain and flatulence in response to probiotic
      administration, whilst others have shown no symptomatic improvement. It is
      possible that the future role of probiotics in IBS will lie in prevention, rather
      than cure.

TI  - Probiotics as modulators of the gut flora.
PG  - S39-49
AB  - Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining 
      the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'.
      Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and
      disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the
      approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be
      the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most
      efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh
      physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes 
      gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A
      survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials,
      with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In
      theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against
      common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of
      acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites,
      immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such,
      persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic
      intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can
      help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for
      genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as
      effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome.
      The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance
      for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target
      groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the
      elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial
      microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions
      involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival
      issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem
      should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful
      probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate
      selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics 
      are known as synbiotics.

TI  - High-fiber diet supplementation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): 
      a multicenter, randomized, open trial comparison between wheat bran diet and
      partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG).
PG  - 1697-704
AB  - High-fiber diet supplementation is commonly used in IBS, although it poses
      several management problems. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) has shown
      beneficial effects in animal and human studies, but its potential role in IBS
      symptom relief has not been evaluated yet. We investigated PHGG in IBS patients
      and compared it to a wheat bran diet. Abdominal pain, bowel habits, and
      subjective overall rating were longitudinally evaluated in 188 adult IBS patients
      (139 women and 49 men) for 12 weeks. Patients were classified as having
      diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or changeable bowel habits and
      were randomly assigned to groups receiving fiber (30 g/day of wheat bran) or PHGG
      (5 g/day). After four weeks, patients were allowed to switch group, depending on 
      their subjective evaluation of their symptoms. Significantly more patients
      switched from fiber to PHGG (49.9%) than from PHGG to fiber (10.9%) at four
      weeks. Per protocol analysis showed that both fiber and PHGG were effective in
      improving pain and bowel habits, but no difference was found between the two
      groups. Conversely, intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater
      success in the PHGG group (60%) than in the fiber group (40%). Moreover,
      significantly more patients in the PHGG group reported a greater subjective
      improvement than those in the Fiber group. In conclusion, improvements in core
      IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bowel habits) were observed with both bran and
      PHGG, but the latter was better tolerated and preferred by patients, revealing a 
      higher probability of success than bran and a lower probability of patients
      abandoning the prescribed regimen, suggesting that it can increase the benefits
      deriving from fiber intake in IBS, making it a valid option to consider for
      high-fiber diet supplementation.

TI  - Diet in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - S45-52
AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often request dietary
      recommendations. They must eat, and they want to know what to eat. Present
      national guidelines recommend dietary treatment with fiber for IBS patients with 
      constipation. Diet recommendations are made based on symptoms. There may be
      different dietary recommendations for constipation, diarrhea, and pain or
      bloating. This article reviews the relationship of foods to IBS and issues of
      food intolerances and hypersensitivities, and recommendations for diet therapy.
      The role of dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble, is reviewed. Although
      there are few studies to substantiate exact diets, broad dietary plans are
      recommended for the different symptoms of IBS. In addition, the recent literature
      on probiotics and prebiotics pertinent to IBS is reviewed.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: basis of clinical management strategies.
PG  - S37-44
AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often described as challenging. 
      The diagnosis of IBS can safely be made using the Rome II criteria in conjunction
      with a thorough physical examination and a limited number of diagnostic studies. 
      Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the
      pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both
      patient and physician alike. Important areas of research focus on the psychology 
      of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g., heightened
      gastrocolonic response), and the "brain-gut axis." A multidisciplinary effort is 
      often required to ameliorate symptoms and improve the patients' quality of life. 
      This review article will discuss the myriad of treatments available for patients 
      with IBS, and provide both a clinical and practical discussion of their use,
      providing evidence where available and clinical experience where it is not.

PG  - 1407-30
AB  - This consensus document reviews the current status of the epidemiology, social
      impact, patient quality of life, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome. Current evidence suggests that two major mechanisms may
      interact in irritable bowel syndrome: altered gastrointestinal motility and
      increased sensitivity of the intestine. However, other factors, such as
      psychosocial factors, intake of food and prior infection, may contribute to its
      development. Management of patients is based on a positive diagnosis of the
      symptom complex, careful history and physical examination to exclude 'red flags' 
      as risk factors for organic disease, and, if indicated, investigations to exclude
      other disorders. Therapeutic choices include dietary fibre for constipation,
      opioid agents for diarrhoea and low-dose antidepressants or infrequent use of
      antispasmodics for pain, although the evidence basis for efficacy is limited or
      in some cases absent. Psychotherapy and hypnotherapy are the subject of ongoing
      study. Treatment should be tailored to patient needs and fears. Novel therapies
      are emerging, and drugs acting on serotonin receptors have proven efficacy and a 
      scientific rationale and, if approved, should be useful in the overall management
      of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Patient and physician education, early
      identification of psychosocial issues and better therapies are important
      strategies to reduce the suffering and societal cost of irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - [Implications of fiber in different pathologies].
PG  - 17-29
AB  - Three decades ago, the observations of Trowell and Burkitt gave rise to the
      "fibre theory", in which it was contended that there was a link between the
      consumption of a diet rich in fibre and non-processed carbohydrates and the level
      of protection against many of the "first world diseases" such as constipation,
      diverticulosis, cancer of the colon, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular
      disease. Since that time, numerous studies have been presented to analyze the
      relationship between fibre and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and other 
      processes with severe health implications. The present revision looks at the
      experience accumulated over this period regarding the importance of the
      consumption of fibre for certain phatologies. It not only deals with the
      epidemiological relationship existing between fibre intake and the development of
      diseases such as cancer of the colon or cardiovascular disorders but also reviews
      the interest of fibre a therapeutic agent, in view of the current information
      available on its different mechanism of action. Thus the possibility of using
      soluble fibre has taken on renewed interest for the treatment of inflammatory
      intestinal disease, for control of diarrhoea, in irritable bowel syndrome or no
      modulate the concentrations of glycaemia or cholesterol. Three is a discussion of
      the discrepancies found between the consumption of fibre and diverticular
      disease, the treatment of constipation and the association with obesity and
      cardiovascular disease. Despite the accumulated evidence on the consumption of
      fibre, there is currently no consensus as to recommendations on what type of
      fibre and the optimal amount that should be consumed. A high fibre intake (>
      25-30 g/day) based on a variety of food sources (fruit, vegetable, legumes,
      cereals) is the only way to avoid many of the disorders mentioned. The
      consumption of a particular type of fibre (soluble or insoluble) is limited to
      the treatment of certain processes, because its individual relationship with many
      disorders is still pending determination.

TI  - [Prevalence and relation of dyspepsia to irritable bowel syndrome in a native
      community of the Peruvian jungle].
PG  - 129-40
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two of the most
      frequent syndromes in gastroenterology. However, very few epidemiological studies
      have been conducted in Peru and none in the Peruvian Jungle. OBJECTIVES: The
      objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of dyspepsia and irritable
      bowel syndrome in a jungle community of Peru and the recurrence percentage of
      these syndromes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample was taken from 231 persons
      randomly selected using the "home by home" method, according to the map provided 
      by Punta del Este Medical Center (city of Tarapoto - Department of San Mart n).
      The persons, considered to best typify the general population of the city, took
      two tests (Dyspepsia Test and Manning Test) that were previously validated during
      the months of January through March 1999. RESULTS: The prevalence of dyspepsia
      was 37.6%, and that of IBS, 22.0%. From those with dyspepsia, 38% had also IBS.
      From those with IBS, 65% reported dyspepsia symptoms. Prevalence of IBS was
      higher in individuals with dyspepsia (37.9%) than in individuals without
      dyspepsia (12.5% p< 0.01). The prevalence of both dyspepsia and IBS decreases as 
      age increases. A statistically significant difference related to ethnicity was
      found in individuals with IBS. Dyspepsia and ethnicity were associated in 31.4%
      to individuals having both pathologies (p< 0.0001 and OR=4.28). The dyspepsia/IBS
      ratio was 1.7/1. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of IBS and dyspepsia in
      the study population. The high association found between both syndromes may be
      due to the common etiopathogenic mechanisms they share such as: a visceral
      hypersensibility due to peripheral or central mechanisms, bowel motility
      disturbances or parasitosis. Our study suggests that both dyspepsia and IBS are
      the manifestations of the same digestive disorder, which has not been fully
      clarified yet.

TI  - A role for inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - i41-4
AB  - Attention has been directed to the putative role of low grade mucosal
      inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on the basis of evidence showing
      that some patients with IBS have an increased number of inflammatory cells in the
      colonic and ileal mucosa. Previous episodes of infectious enteritis, genetic
      factors, undiagnosed food allergies, and changes in bacterial microflora may all 
      play a role in promoting and perpetuating this low grade inflammatory process.
      Human and animal studies support the concept that inflammation may perturb
      gastrointestinal reflexes and activate the visceral sensory system even when the 
      inflammatory response is minimal and confined to the mucosa. Thus abnormal
      neuroimmune interactions may contribute to the altered gastrointestinal
      physiology and hypersensitivity that underlies IBS. A brief review of the human
      and animal studies that have focused on the putative role of intestinal
      inflammation and infections in the pathogenesis of IBS is given.

PG  - 255-73
AB  - Probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms which, when ingested, exert a
      positive influence on the health or physiology of the host. Their mechanisms of
      action and effects are now studied using the same pharmacological approach as for
      drugs. This article summarizes and comments on evidence for the positive effects 
      of probiotics in various clinical situations. Substantial evidence can be
      achieved when randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses show positive
      results. The clinical situations studied include prevention or treatment of
      antibiotic-associated disorders, gastroenteritis, and diarrhea, lactose
      intolerance, intestinal infections and colonization by pathogenic bacteria
      (including Helicobacter pylori and Clostridium difficile), traveler's diarrhea,
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colonic cancer,
      urogenital infections and tumors, allergy (especially atopic eczema),
      vaccination, and cholesterol lowering. Current probiotics have an excellent
      safety record--another topic discussed in this article.

TI  - Functional foods in pediatrics.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - The philosophy that food can be health promoting beyond its nutritional value is 
      gaining acceptance. Known disease preventive aspects of nutrition have led to a
      new science, the 'functional food science'. Functional foods, first introduced in
      Japan, have no universally accepted definition but can be described as foods or
      food ingredients that may provide health benefits and prevent diseases.
      Currently, there is a growing interest in these products. However, not all
      regulatory issues have been settled yet. Five categories of foods can be
      classified as functional foods: dietary fibers, vitamins and minerals, bioactive 
      substances, fatty acids and pro-, pre- and symbiotics. The latter are currently
      the main focus of research. Functional foods can be applied in pediatrics: during
      pregnancy, nutrition is 'functional' since it has prenatal influences on the
      intra-uterine development of the baby, after birth, 'functional' human milk
      supports adequate growth of infants and pro- and prebiotics can modulate the
      flora composition and as such confer certain health advantages. Functional foods 
      have also been studied in pediatric diseases. The severity of necrotising
      enterocolitis (NEC), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal allergy and
      lactose intolerance may be reduced by using functional foods. Functional foods
      have proven to be valuable contributors to the improvement of health and the
      prevention of diseases in pediatric populations.

TI  - Sensitization, subjective health complaints, and sustained arousal.
PG  - 119-29
AB  - The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the possibility that sensitization
      is a psychobiological mechanism underlying not only multiple chemical sensitivity
      (MCS), but a much more general cluster of illness, referred to as "subjective
      health complaints". Sustained arousal, or sustained "stress" responses, may be an
      important factor for the development of these conditions. Patients with
      subjective complaints without objective changes are sometimes referred to as
      having "fashionable diagnoses" or "unexplained symptoms". They may be given
      diagnoses like MCS, epidemic fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, burnout, stress, 
      a variety of intoxications, environmental illness, radiation, multiple chemical
      hypersensitivity, food intolerance, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel,
      myalgic encephalitis, postviral syndrome, yuppie flu, fibromyalgia, or vital
      exhaustion. One issue is whether this is one general condition or separate
      entities. Another issue is whether sensitization may be the psychobiological
      mechanism for most or all of these conditions. Finally, is it likely that
      sustained arousal may facilitate the development of sensitization in some or many
      neural circuits? In this review, the main emphasis will be on musculoskeletal
      pain. This is the most frequent and most expensive condition for sickness
      compensation and disability. The comorbidity of other complaints, however, will
      also be taken into account.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome and nonspecific diarrhea in infancy and

PG  - 145-50
AB  - Lactose intolerance and malabsorbed carbohydrate present in some fruitjuice may
      trigger symptoms commonly seen in irritable bowel syndrome. In a two-site study, 
      28 subjects 9 months to 18 years old (mean 6.9 +/- 5.9 years) with significant
      intake of apple juice or pear nectar (> 6 oz a day) with the diagnoses of
      irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, or chronic nonspecific
      diarrhea were recruited. Breath hydrogen tolerance tests utilizing lactose,
      sucrose, and apple juice in the amount they typically consumed were positive in
      32%, 0%, and 50%, respectively. Subjects were asked to refrain from the ingestion
      ofjuice for 1 month: 13 of the 28 (46%) subjects improved while 15 (54%) showed
      no change in their symptoms. In fact, none consuming 6 to 12 oz of apple or pear 
      juice daily improved, 27% of those consuming 12 to 16 oz improved, and 91% of
      those consuming > 16 oz improved (P < 0.02). Subjects were then given comparable 
      amounts of white grape juice for 1 year. The initial symptoms did not recur in
      any of the subjects who initially responded to the juice-free diet. Of the 15
      subjects who did not respond to the juice-free diet, seven became asymptomatic.
      Overall, 20 subjects (71%) were asymptomatic, and eight (29%) had no change in
      their symptoms. Some individuals with irritable bowel syndrome have their
      symptoms based on their malabsorption of carbohydrates present in apple juice and
      pear nectar and may improve with adequate choices of fruit juice such as changing
      to white grape juice.

TI  - The burden of selected digestive diseases in the United States.
PG  - 1500-11
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases inflict a heavy
      economic burden. Although the burden is considerable, current and accessible
      information on the prevalence, morbidity, and cost is sparse. This study was
      undertaken to estimate the economic burden of GI and liver disease in the United 
      States for use by policy makers, health care providers, and the public. METHODS: 
      Data were extracted from a number of publicly available and proprietary national 
      databases to determine the prevalence, direct costs, and indirect costs for 17
      selected GI and liver diseases. Indirect cost calculations were purposefully very
      conservative. These costs were compared with National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
      research expenditures for selected GI and liver diseases. RESULTS: The most
      prevalent diseases were non-food-borne gastroenteritis (135 million cases/year), 
      food-borne illness (76 million), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; 19
      million), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; 15 million). The disease with the
      highest annual direct costs in the United States was GERD ($9.3 billion),
      followed by gallbladder disease ($5.8 billion), colorectal cancer ($4.8 billion),
      and peptic ulcer disease ($3.1 billion). The estimated direct costs for these 17 
      diseases in 1998 dollars were $36.0 billion, with estimated indirect costs of
      $22.8 billion. The estimated direct costs for all digestive diseases were $85.5
      billion. Total NIH research expenditures were $676 million in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: 
      GI and liver diseases exact heavy economic and social costs in the United States.
      Understanding the prevalence and costs of these diseases is important to help set
      priorities to reduce the burden of illness.

TI  - [Cognitive therapy for patients with refractory irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 156-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the procedure and tactics used in the cognitive therapy
      for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and to evaluate the efficacy of
      cognitive therapy in the treatment of refractory IBS. METHODS: A self-control
      study on the cognitive therapy for 22 patients with refractory IBS symptoms
      (according to Rome II criteria) was performed. The procedure of cognitive therapy
      included five steps, namely health education, patients' questioning, relaxing
      training, dissensitization training, and patients' homework for enforcing the
      effect of former four steps. The effects of cognitive therapy for IBS were
      evaluated by improvement of symptom-related-anxiety, index of symptom, quality of
      life specific for IBS and coping. RESULTS: All 22 cases completed cognitive
      therapy and first follow-up unit (FFU), at the end of FFU, clinical symptoms in
      all patients improved (P < 0.05), of them, 81.8% improved significantly (P <
      0.001); at 12-months-follow-up, complete remission of clinical symptoms occurred 
      in 72.7% (8/11) patients. Comparison of the scores of symptom-related-anxiety,
      index of symptom, quality of life specific IBS and coping at the end of 1st
      follow-up unit with that at basal level, the scores of symptom-anxiety, indexes
      of severity and frequency of symptoms decreased significantly (P < 0.001,
      respectively); the scores of depression and anxiety in SCL-90 also decreased
      significantly (P < 0.001). The scores of active coping rose significantly (P =
      0.000). IBS-QOL improved significantly (P < 0.05), of them, dysphoria, body
      image, food avoidence improved very significantly (P < 0.001, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive therapy for patients with refractory IBS is rational and
      effective. During cognitive therapy, we should follow the therapeutic procedure
      and the principle of individuation.

TI  - [Probiotics in gastroenterology].
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms of human origin. Their use may
      favorably influence human health and ameliorate or prevent certain diseases.
      Prebiotics are non-digestible foodstuffs (fiber, oligofructans - "colonic
      foods"), which enter the colon and are metabolized by the probiotics. Probiotics 
      should fulfill the following criteria: Phenotypic and genotypic classification,
      no pathogenic properties, human origin, application in the living state,
      resistance to gastric acid and bile, ability to adhere to colonocytes, ability to
      colonize the gut, clinically proved favorable health-effect, and safety.
      Experimental and clinical studies supplied evidence of the possible use of
      probiotics in the following diseases: Traveler's diarrhea, antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, infantile diarrhea, rotavirus 
      enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer,
      peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, and diarrhea associated with HIV infection.
      Probiotics displayed the following effects in these studies: Involvement in
      production of essential nutrients of the colonic mucosa, beneficial effect on
      intestinal immunity, recovery of the disturbed gut mucosal barrier and prevention
      of microbial translocation, elimination of toxins and eradication of microbial
      pathogens, production of steroids from cholesterol and reduction of its pool in
      circulation, participation in regulation of intestinal functions, reduced
      incidence of chemically induced colon tumors in rodents. Probiotics open new
      therapeutic modalities in a number of diseases and it may be expected that their 
      importance will increase with growing knowledge and experience.

TI  - Sensation of bloating and visible abdominal distension in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 3341-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Abdominal bloating and distension are common symptoms of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The postulated pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
      these symptoms include increased production, retention, or perception of gas or
      luminal contents. The aims of this study were to prospectively compare the
      prevalence of, and clinical factors related to, bloating and distension in an IBS
      patient population. METHODS: A total of 714 consecutive patients who met Rome I
      criteria for IBS were prospectively surveyed, and were classified as having
      bloating alone (B) or bloating and distension (B+D) based on a comprehensive
      bowel symptom questionnaire. GI, extraintestinal, and psychological symptoms, as 
      well as health-related quality of life measures were also assessed using
      validated survey instruments. RESULTS: A total of 542 IBS patients (76%) who
      reported abdominal bloating were studied. Of these, 132 patients fulfilled
      criteria for the B group, whereas 410 patients fulfilled criteria for the B+D
      group. There was a significantly different gender distribution in the B and B+D
      groups (female:male ratios, 1.4:1 and 2.8:1, respectively p < 0.02). There was
      also a significantly different bowel habit subgroup distribution, with a greater 
      predominance of constipation in B+D group and of diarrhea in the B group (p <
      0.03). Both groups were similar in other clinical parameters, including
      progressive worsening of symptoms during the day, and relief by passing stool or 
      gas. Both bloating and distension worsened when other abdominal symptoms
      worsened. Abdominal distension was associated with greater symptom severity and
      less diurnal variation in symptoms, and was less often perceived as associated
      with food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Bloating and visible abdominal distension may
      arise from two distinct but interrelated physiological processes. Although the
      sensation of bloating may be related to enhanced sensitivity to visceral afferent
      stimulation, abdominal distension in more severely affected patients may be
      related to triggering of a visceromotor reflex affecting the tone of abdominal
      wall muscles.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: an update on therapeutic modalities.
PG  - 1211-22
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common condition that a physician
      faces in the GI clinic. Of the general population, 10 - 25% suffer from symptoms 
      judged to be IBS. The negative impact of this disease includes not only pain,
      suffering and direct medical expenses but also significant social and job-related
      consequences. IBS can be the result of dysfunction in any part of the brain-gut
      axis: alterations in the CNS caused by psychological or other factors, abnormal
      gastrointestinal motility, or heightened visceral sensations. Diagnosis is based 
      on either the Manning or Rome-II criteria. Education, reassurance and emotional
      support are the cornerstones of successful treatment. The mainstays of the
      current therapeutic approach continue to be: stress management strategies,
      dietary modification entailing addition of dietary fibre and pharmacotherapy.
      Pharmacotherapy is still limited to treating symptoms. Newer drugs that modulate 
      motility or drugs that modulate visceral sensation may be useful in selected
      cases. Psychopharmacological agents are useful in the treatment of IBS,
      especially in those with psychological co-morbidity. Alternative therapies such
      as homeopathy, acupuncture, special diets, herbal medication and several forms of
      psychological treatments and hypnotherapy are sought by many patients and are now
      being offered by physicians as treatment options, either alone or in conjunction 
      with conventional forms of therapy in patients with refractory symptoms.

PG  - 244-50
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a remarkably frequent disorder that leads to
      relevant impairment in patients' quality of life. Four mechanisms are involved in
      the pathogenesis of IBS: altered intestinal motility; increased visceral
      sensitivity; disturbed intestinal reflexes (intrinsic and extrinsic), and
      psychological disorders. The close relationship between the central nervous
      system and the enteric nervous system (the brain-gut axis) is the basis of the
      actual research on IBS therapy. It is conceivable that in the near future a
      better understanding of IBS pathophysiology will help us to tailor treatment for 
      different IBS patients. At the moment, the subclassification of the diverse
      patterns of symptomatology allows the adjustment of treatments for IBS according 
      to the clinical predominance of each patient. Dietary modifications like fiber
      supplementation, antidiarrheal agents and antispasmodic drugs are the basis of
      the current treatment of IBS and depend on the predominant symptom (constipation,
      diarrhea or pain, respectively). If severe pain is present, antidepressant agents
      are an appropriate alternative. However, the scientific evidence supporting this 
      current therapeutic approach is limited. Visceral analgesics and serotonin
      agonists and antagonists may play an important therapeutic role in the near
      future. However, it is not likely that one single treatment will help every IBS
      patient and many of them will need a more complex approach with multidisciplinary
      therapy (diet, psychotherapy, medications).

TI  - Localization, physiological significance and possible clinical implication of
      gastrointestinal melatonin.
PG  - 350-66
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major source of extrapineal melatonin. In
      some animals, tissue concentrations of melatonin in the GIT surpass blood levels 
      by 10-100 times and the digestive tract contributes significantly to melatonin
      concentrations in the peripheral blood, particularly during the day. Some
      melatonin found in the GIT may originate from the pineal gland, as the organs of 
      the digestive system contain binding sites, which in some species exhibit
      circadian variation. Unlike the production of pineal melatonin, which is under
      the photoperiodic control, release of GI melatonin seems to be related to
      periodicity of food intake. Melatonin and melatonin binding sites were localized 
      in all GI tissues of mammalian and avian embryos. Postnatally, melatonin was
      localized in the GIT of newborn mice and rats. Phylogenetically, melatonin and
      melatonin binding sites were detected in GIT of numerous mammals, birds and lower
      vertebrates. Melatonin is probably produced in the serotonin-rich
      enterochromaffin cells (EC) of the GI mucosa and can be released into the portal 
      vein postprandially. In addition, melatonin can act as an autocrine or a
      paracrine hormone affecting the function of GI epithelium, lymphatic tissues of
      the immune system and the smooth muscles of the digestive tube. Finally,
      melatonin may act as a luminal hormone, synchronizing the sequential digestive
      processes. Higher peripheral and tissue levels of melatonin were observed not
      only after food intake but also after a long-term food deprivation. Such
      melatonin release may have a direct effect on the various GI tissues but may also
      act indirectly via the CNS; such action might be mediated by sympathetic or
      parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin can protect GI mucosa from ulceration by its
      antioxidant action, stimulation of the immune system and by fostering
      microcirculation and epithelial regeneration. Melatonin may reduce the secretion 
      of pepsin and the hydrochloric acid and influence the activity of the myoelectric
      complexes of the gut via its action in the CNS. Tissue or blood levels of
      melatonin may serve as a marker of GI lesions or tumors. Clinically, melatonin
      has a potential for a prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative
      colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, children colic and diarrhea.

TI  - A controlled, double-blind, randomized study on the efficacy of Lactobacillus
      plantarum 299V in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1143-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a widespread functional disorder of
      the digestive tract. Its aetiology is unknown and therapeutic options are
      limited. Recent reports suggest that probiotics may have a role in regulating the
      motility of the digestive tract. AIM: To assess the efficacy of Lactobacillus
      plantarum 299V (LP299V) in patients with IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty
      patients were randomized to receive either LP299V in liquid suspension (20
      patients) or placebo (20 patients) over a period of 4 weeks. Clinical examination
      was performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Additionally, patients
      assessed their symptoms by applying a scoring system. RESULTS: All patients
      treated with LP299V reported resolution of their abdominal pain as compared to 11
      patients from a placebo group (P = 0.0012). There was also a trend towards
      normalization of stools frequency in constipated patients in six out of 10
      patients treated with LP299V compared with two out of 11 treated with placebo (P 
      = 0.17). With regards to all IBS symptoms an improvement was noted in 95% of
      patients in the LP299V group vs 15% of patients in the placebo group (P <
      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: LP299V seems to have a beneficial effect in patients with
      IBS. Further studies on larger cohorts of patients and with longer duration of
      therapy are required in order to establish the place of L. plantarum in the
      treatment of IBS.

TI  - Probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome: a light in the darkness?
PG  - 1135-6
AB  - Probiotics have been used with apparent success for several gut disorders, so it 
      is not surprising they have been tried in the treatment of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). However, the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown, and
      opinions about how probiotics might work are speculative. Nevertheless, two small
      trials suggest they might benefit patients with IBS, particularly those suffering
      from pain and bloating. This possibility deserves further study. It is important 
      though, that future trials employ criteria-identified subjects, be sufficiently
      powered and strictly double blind, and select a suitable outcome measure. Until
      state-of-the-art trials of probiotics are available, their use should remain in
      the experimental arena.

AB  - Food products have variously been reported as causing, perpetuating or treating
      irritable bowel syndrome. The evidence for this is reviewed with regard to recent
      studies investigating symptom reporting, mono- and disaccharide malabsorption and
      probiotics. The development of objective measures remains an urgent priority
      because of the high placebo response to any dietary intervention in irritable
      bowel syndrome.

TI  - IgE binding to soluble and insoluble wheat flour proteins in atopic and
      non-atopic patients suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms after wheat
      ingestion.
PG  - 1771-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The involvement of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions in the
      genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of foods containing wheat
      has been rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To detect IgE specifically binding to wheat 
      proteins in the sera of atopic and non-atopic patients suffering from
      gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of wheat and to evaluate the
      reliability of skin prick test and CAP in the diagnosis of food allergy to wheat.
      METHODS: The sera of patients (10 atopic and 10 non-atopic) previously diagnosed 
      as suffering from irritable bowel syndrome and complaining of symptoms after
      wheat ingestion were analysed by immunoblotting for IgE binding to
      water/salt-soluble and insoluble wheat flour proteins. RESULTS: All the atopic
      patients and only one of the non-atopic patients were positive to wheat CAP. For 
      the patients tested, skin prick test was positive for all the atopic patients and
      for only one of the non-atopic patients. However, immunoblotting experiments
      showed the presence of specific IgE to wheat proteins in all the patients. Ten
      out of 11 of the wheat CAP-positive patients had IgE binding to a soluble 16-kDa 
      band, but the same band was recognized, in a slighter way, by only two out of
      nine of the wheat CAP-negative patients. Moreover, although almost all of the
      patients were negative in CAP testing with gluten, 19 out of 20 recognized
      protein bands belonging to the prolamin fraction. CONCLUSIONS: For the atopic
      patients the positivity to skin prick test and CAP to wheat was in accordance
      with the immunoblotting results and a food allergy to wheat could be diagnosed.
      In these patients a major allergen was a 16-kDa band corresponding to members of 
      the cereal alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors protein family, the major allergens
      involved in baker's asthma. In the non-atopic patients the positive
      immunoblotting results contrasted with the responses of the allergologic tests,
      indicating that the allergenic wheat protein preparations currently used are of
      limited value in detecting specific IgE to wheat and that the fraction of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with food allergy may be larger than
      believed.

TI  - Effects of probiotic administration upon the composition and enzymatic activity
      of human fecal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional
      diarrhea.
PG  - 735-41
AB  - In a clinical trial, 10 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or
      functional diarrhea were administered the probiotic preparation VSL-3.
      Preliminary results indicated that administration of VSL-3 improved the clinical 
      picture and changed the composition and biochemistry of fecal microbiota. Titer
      variations of intestinal bacterial groups were evaluated by culture and PCR
      techniques. A significant increase in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and
      Streptococcus thermophilus was observed as a consequence of probiotic treatment, 
      while enterococci, coliforms, Bacteroides and Clostridium perfringens did not
      change significantly. The strains Bifidobacterium infantis Y1 and Bifidobacterium
      breve Y8, included in VSL-3, were specifically detected in feces of patients
      treated with the probiotic by using strain-specific PCR primers. In addition,
      fecal beta-galactosidase increased and urease activities decreased as a result of
      changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by VSL-3 administration.

      measures, pharmacotherapy forms a major pillar in the treatment of IBS, despite
      the fact that because the pathophysiology is still unknown, we have no causal
      drug treatment available. In the first instance, medication is a recommended
      supportive measure for application during the symptom-free intervals. It is
      oriented to the patient's leading complaints, and is directed towards the
      regulation of bowel movements, treatment of flatulency, and amelioration of
      painful motility disorders (e.g. spasms).

TI  - Psychological and physiological responses to postprandial mental stress in women 
      with the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 805-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the psychological (affective and symptomatic) and
      physiological (autonomic and cortisol) responses to postprandial mental stress in
      women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It was hypothesized that patients with
      IBS would show exaggerated autonomic and cortisol responses to the psychological 
      stressor and that the stressor would enhance gastrointestinal symptoms. METHOD:
      Twenty-four women with IBS and 20 healthy women participated in the two-day study
      protocol. Both days were identical, with the exception that on one day, a
      stressful mental task was completed after ingestion of a standard meal. Heart
      rate variability, cortisol, affective, and symptomatic responses were measured
      before and after application of the stressor. RESULTS: Patients with IBS
      demonstrated increased negative affect at baseline and in response to the
      stressor. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not affected by the stressor. Appraisal 
      of the stressor by patients with IBS was not different from that of controls.
      There were no group differences in the autonomic response to the stressor. There 
      was no overall cortisol response to the stressor in either group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with IBS respond with greater negative affect to postprandial
      psychological stress as well as to food intake alone, and they can be
      distinguished from controls on the basis of self-report data. Patients with IBS
      cannot be differentiated from controls on the basis of the pattern of changes in 
      sympathetic activation after the mental stressor. The stressor used in this study
      did not elicit a cortisol response in either group.

TI  - The effect of a lactose-restricted diet in patients with a positive lactose
      tolerance test, earlier diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome: a 5-year follow-up
      study.
PG  - 941-4
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospectively, the effect of a lactose-restricted diet was
      evaluated among irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption.
      Lactose malabsorption was defined by a positive hydrogen breath test and a
      positive blood-glucose test. An analysis of symptoms was completed before,
      during, 6 weeks after and 5 years after starting the diet. In addition, the
      number of visits made by the patients to the outpatient clinic was scored during 
      6 years. RESULTS: In 17 out of 70 irritable bowel syndrome patients (24.3%),
      lactose malabsorption was detected. There was no difference in the symptom score 
      between patients with a positive lactose tolerance test and patients with a
      negative lactose tolerance test. After 6 weeks of the lactose-restricted diet,
      symptoms were markedly improved in lactose malabsorption-positive patients (P <
      0.001). After 5 years, one patient was lost for follow-up, and 14 out of the
      remaining 16 lactose malabsorption patients (87.5%) still had no complaints
      during the lactose-restricted diet. Two patients chose not to follow the diet
      continuously and accepted the discomfort caused by lactose intake. Only two out
      of 16 patients (12.5%) no longer experienced any benefit from lactose
      restriction. In the 5 years before their diagnosis of lactose malabsorption,
      these 16 patients visited the outpatient clinic a total of 192 times (mean 2.4
      visits per year per person; range 1-7 visits). In the 5 years after diagnosis,
      they visited the outpatient clinic a total of 45 times (mean 0.6 visits per year 
      per person; range 0-6 visits; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large majority of
      irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption, which was
      previously clinically unrecognized, a lactose-restricted diet improved symptoms
      markedly both in the short term and the long term. Furthermore, visits by all
      patients to the outpatient clinic were reduced by 75%. We conclude that diet
      therapy is extremely cost- and time-saving. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
      that lactose malabsorption, which is easily treatable, is excluded before
      diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      abdominal pain and a change in bowel habits. It is estimated to occur in 9% to
      22% of the US population, and is more often diagnosed in women than in men. There
      are no diagnostic markers for irritable bowel syndrome and no evidence of organic
      disease. Moreover, the pathophysiology is not completely understood; however,
      abnormal gastrointestinal motility, altered sensory activity, central neural
      dysfunction, psychological disturbances, and luminal factors have been proposed. 
      Treatment requires a multifaceted approach. Education, dietary measures, fiber
      supplementation, and pharmacological and psychological interventions have been
      used in the management of this disorder.

PG  - 666-71
AB  - Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, need to rush to the toilet, straining,
      feeling of incomplete bowel emptying and alternating periods of diarrhea and
      constipation is the clinical definition of the irritable bowel syndrome. The
      internationally used syndrome definition is based on expert opinions and answers 
      to patient questionnaires. When symptoms are registered prospectively, abdominal 
      pain starts or worsens after meals and is not relieved by defecation. As in the
      general population patients with the syndrome define diarrhea as loose stools and
      constipation as hard stools regardless of stool frequencies. Variation in
      defecatory symptoms and discrepancies between these symptoms and stool
      consistency are the hallmarks of the syndrome, and the degree of variation per
      fortnight is relatively stable in the individual patient. Fermentation of
      carbohydrates by colonic bacteria, increased sensitivity to bowel distention by
      gas, gas-producing food, increased secretion of cholecystokinin after fatty meals
      and/or increased sympathetic nerve tone at stress can give rise to symptoms.
      Symptoms can start after a single period of bacterial gastroenteritis. Although
      patients seeking medical care for the syndrome are more often anxious, the
      syndrome itself is not psychosomatic. Symptoms are possibly mediated through
      partial degranulation of mast cells in bowel mucosa, but this does not make it an
      allergic disease. If bowel dysmotility can be measured, early stage or a mild
      case of intestinal pseudoobstruction should be considered. Hyperreactivity in the
      enteric nervous system and/or in the brain is the likely main cause of the
      symptoms. More widespread activity in the brain after exposure to stimuli
      originating from bowel nerves or less inhibition of this stimulation in the brain
      are possible mechanisms.

TI  - Gender-related differences in IBS symptoms.
PG  - 2184-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women are more likely than men to report irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) symptoms as well as chronic visceral and musculoskeletal pain. The study
      tests the general hypothesis that female IBS patients differ from their male
      counterparts in symptoms related to the viscera and musculoskeletal system, and
      that these differences are related to the menstrual cycle. METHODS: Seven hundred
      fourteen Rome positive IBS patients were evaluated for GI and extracolonic
      symptoms, psychological symptoms (SCL-90R), and quality of life (QOL) (SF-36). In
      addition, 54 postmenopausal women were compared with 61 premenopausal women and
      54 age-matched males, all with IBS. RESULTS: Male and female subjects reported
      similar GI levels of symptom severity and psychological problems. Abdominal
      distension associated with a sensation of bloating was more commonly reported by 
      female patients, as were symptoms of constipation. Female patients more often
      reported nausea, alterations of taste and smell, and unpleasant sensations on the
      tongue, muscle stiffness in the morning, greater food sensitivity, and side
      effects from medications. Forty percent of female patients reported menstrual
      cycle-related worsening of symptoms, but few symptom differences were found
      between pre- and postmenopausal women, making it unlikely that most of the gender
      differences observed are directly tied to the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS:
      Female patients report higher levels of a variety of intestinal and nonintestinal
      sensory symptoms despite similar levels of IBS severity, abdominal pain,
      psychological symptoms, and illness impact. The apparent differences in
      sensitivity to nonpainful visceral sensations, medications, and food may
      represent altered sensory processes, autonomic responses, and/or cognitive
      hypervigilance.

TI  - Dietary treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: current evidence and guidelines
      for future practice.
PG  - 231-41
AB  - The aim of this literature review is to produce guidelines for dietetic practice 
      in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating the research available. In this
      area randomized control trials (RCT) only account for a small proportion of the
      literature and have been concentrated in the modification of dietary fibre in
      patients with IBS. The bulk of the literature is mainly observational trials from
      which no indisputable conclusions can be extracted. In this review, the evidence 
      available has been interpreted within the context of the current knowledge base. 
      Conclusions are drawn to facilitate the development of guidelines, enabling a
      starting point for discussion and an evaluation of current practice. The
      literature available on therapeutic dietary manipulation in IBS patients is
      centred around non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), mono and disaccharide
      sensitivity and food intolerance. The production of these guidelines has focused 
      on research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic
      management of patients with IBS. However, where there is a deficiency in the
      literature directly relating dietary intake to management of IBS patients,
      physiological function in relation to dietary components has been relied upon to 
      produce practical guidelines which can be applied realistically in a clinical
      environment. An interpretation of the evidence has revealed a limited role for
      exclusion diets, a move away from high-fibre diets towards the manipulation of
      fibre fractions in the diet, an evaluation of the effects of caffeine on gut
      function and the necessity for individual dietary assessment to identify dietary 
      issues pertinent to the patient's symptoms. These guidelines outline a positive
      role for dietitians in the treatment of IBS patients which draws on the unique
      skills possessed by dietitians regarding the assessment of habitual eating habits
      and therapeutic dietary manipulation.

TI  - Adaptation of bacteria to the intestinal niche: probiotics and gut disorder.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem host to a diverse and highly
      evolved microbial community composed of hundreds of different microbial species. 
      The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the
      human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the
      incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g.,
      gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea,
      constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers).
      Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional
      microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent
      analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an
      understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal
      adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also
      elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only 
      allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional
      food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific 
      basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to 
      prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome in a rural community in Bangladesh: prevalence, symptoms
      pattern, and health care seeking behavior.
PG  - 1547-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) and the pattern of symptoms and health care seeking behavior
      of IBS subjects in the rural population in Bangladesh. METHODS: This was an
      observational study to do a positive diagnosis of IBS. A total of 2426 persons > 
      or =15 yr old were interviewed by a predesigned questionnaire based on the Rome
      criteria. Two villages of a northern district in Bangladesh were included.
      RESULTS: A response of 95.4% yielded 2426 questionnaires for analysis. Mean age
      of the surveyed sample was 32.3+/-14.2 yr. In total, 1113 (45.9%) were men, and
      1313 (54.1%) were women. Farmers and housewives comprised 2058 (84.8%) persons.
      The apparent prevalence of IBS was 24.4% with a prevalence of 20.6% in men and
      27.7% in women. With strict Rome criteria, the overall prevalence was 8.5% (10.7%
      in women and 5.8% in men). Age was not found to influence the prevalence in
      either sex. Other than abdominal pain, the most common IBS symptom was altered
      stool passage (81.1%). Others in order of frequency were passage of mucus with
      stool (56.8%), abdominal distension (46.2%), altered stool form (46%), and
      altered stool frequency (18.2%). Spastic colon pain was noted in 339 (57.2%). IBS
      subjects with more prevalence of colonic symptoms in the nonspastic group.
      Drinking milk was found to have a little impact on IBS. A total of 35% IBS
      subjects consulted doctors for symptoms. Age, sex, and number of symptoms did not
      influence health care seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: IBS is also a problem in
      rural people in Bangladesh with a prevalence almost identical to most other
      countries, and only a minority of them seeks health care. Positive diagnosis of
      IBS can be done by precisely enquiring colonic symptoms in apparently healthy
      people.

TI  - Beneficial health effects of low-digestible carbohydrate consumption.
PG  - S23-30
AB  - Low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides
      that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small
      bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid
      metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In
      the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called
      fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is
      used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible
      carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to
      avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation
      products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are
      considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect
      of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates
      increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional
      constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel
      syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the
      maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs 
      between disease entities.

TI  - Drug treatment options for irritable bowel syndrome: managing for success.
PG  - 201-11
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gut disorder the diagnosis of
      which is based on clinical symptoms as set forth by the Rome criteria. As the
      population ages, especially with the population of patients >75 years of age
      expanding greatly over the next 10 years, IBS is becoming one of the most common 
      diseases of the elderly. Thus far, developing treatment strategies for patients
      with IBS has been difficult because of the lack of pharmacological targets and
      the wide range of symptomatology. Additionally, demonstration of a therapeutic
      benefit is difficult in the presence of a high placebo response observed
      regardless of the therapy employed. Fibre, antidiarrhoeals and antispasmodics all
      play some role in the symptomatic treatment of IBS. With the evolution of IBS as 
      a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity, new drugs have been developed that
      target the enteric nervous system. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been
      found to target the enteric neurons and play a role in pain modulation.
      Currently, the TCAs are recommended only for severe cases of IBS pain. The newest
      class of drugs to be approved for use in IBS are the serotonin
      (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) antagonists. Specifically, the 5-HT3 receptor
      antagonists have been shown to decrease symptoms in female patients with IBS. A
      related class of drugs, the 5-HT4 receptor agonists, is being developed for the
      treatment of constipation-predominant IBS. Further investigation into the role of
      spinal afferent neurons in visceral hypersensitivity is at the forefront of IBS
      research. Several experimental drug therapies for IBS are also discussed in this 
      review including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 receptor
      antagonists, octreotide, clonidine and the selective M3 receptor antagonist,
      zamifenacin.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome: is the search for lactose intolerance justified?
PG  - 219-25
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if confirmation of hypolactasia offers any benefit to
      the dietary treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS:
      One hundred and twenty-two consecutive IBS patients (37 male, 85 female) were
      given lactose hydrogen breath tests (LHBT). Those with positive LHBT followed a
      low lactose diet for 3 weeks. Those improving on the diet were given
      double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges (DBPCC) with 5 g, 10 g and 15 g of
      lactose and a placebo, to confirm lactose intolerance. Those who did not respond 
      to the low lactose diet followed either an exclusion or low fibre diet. Symptoms 
      scores were kept prior to the LHBT, 8 h post-LHBT and daily whilst following any 
      dietary change. Patients with negative LHBT returned to clinic and subsequent
      dietary interventions were recorded. RESULTS: LHBT was positive in 33/122 (27%)
      IBS patients. Syrr otom scores prior to LHBT were not significantly different
      between the two groups, but after LHBT the symptoms in the positive group were
      significantly worse. Twenty-three patients followed a low-lactose diet of which
      only nine (39%) improved. Six who did not improve followed an exclusion diet,
      three improved and all were intolerant of milk. Three tried a low fibre diet with
      two improving. DBPCC were inconclusive. In the negative LHBT group 35 agreed to
      try a diet and 24 improved (69%). Eight were intolerant of cow's milk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of a low lactose diet was disappointing in IBS patients with
      lactose malabsorption. Food intolerance was demonstrated in IBS patients with
      positive or negative LHBT and milk was identified as a problem in both groups.
      DBPCC were inconclusive. There appears to be little advantage in trying to
      separate patients who malabsorb lactose from others with IBS.

TI  - Food hypersensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 439-49
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common condition but its pathophysiology remains
      poorly understood. Many irritable bowel syndrome patients give a history of food 
      intolerance, but data from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are
      inconclusive. Multiple aetio-pathological mechanisms have been postulated. The
      gut has an extensive immune system but current understanding of processing of
      food antigens in health and disease is limited. There is no clinically useful
      marker available to test for food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.
      Researchers have employed both skin tests and serum immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE)
      as markers of food hypersensitivity in various disorders including irritable
      bowel syndrome, but published data are equivocal. In this article, the evidence
      for the role of food hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome is reviewed
      and, based on the available data, a possible pathophysiological hypothesis has
      been formulated.

TI  - Food-related gastrointestinal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 108-15
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). However, existing studies have come to different
      conclusions about the role of food in the pathophysiology of IBS. We explored the
      prevalence of subjective food-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and its
      relationship to clinical characteristics and psychological factors in IBS.
      METHODS: 330 patients with IBS and 80 healthy volunteers completed a food
      questionnaire developed for this study. The subjects graded their subjective
      symptoms after 35 different foods and a food score was obtained by adding the
      item scores. The relationship between subjective food-related GI symptoms and
      referral status, IBS subgroup (predominant bowel pattern), sex, anxiety,
      depression and body mass index (BMI) was estimated. RESULTS: In 209 (63%) of the 
      patients the GI symptoms were related to meals. Gas problems and abdominal pain
      were the most frequently reported symptoms. Foods rich in carbohydrates, as well 
      as fatty food, coffee, alcohol and hot spices were most frequently reported to
      cause symptoms. The food score was higher in patients than in controls (p <
      0.0001). In the IBS group higher scores were observed in patients with anxiety (p
      = 0.005), and females (p < 0.001), but the results were unrelated to IBS
      subgroup, referral status or BMI. The BMI did not differ between groups.
      CONCLUSION: A majority of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to
      meals. Especially foods rich in carbohydrates and fat cause problems.
      Nevertheless, the majority of IBS patients are normal or overweight. Female sex
      and anxiety predict a high degree of food-related symptoms in IBS.

TI  - Diarrhea- and constipation-predominant IBS patients differ in postprandial
      autonomic and cortisol responses.
PG  - 460-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As the primary link between brain and gut, autonomic and endocrine
      dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiology of the irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to assess autonomic, endocrine, and
      symptomatic responses to food intake in diarrhea-predominant and
      constipation-predominant IBS patients, compared to normals. METHODS: Twelve women
      with diarrhea-predominant or alternating IBS (IBS-D), 12 women with constipation 
      predominant IBS (IBS-C), and 20 healthy women participated. GI symptoms, saliva
      cortisol concentration, heart rate, and heart rate variability were assessed at
      baseline and after a meal. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used
      as a measure of the sympathovagal regulation of the heart rate. RESULTS: Both
      groups of IBS patients showed a significant postprandial increase in GI symptoms.
      IBS-D showed a significant increase in the low frequency/high frequency band
      ratio and a decrease in the high frequency band power during the first postmeal
      period, which was significantly different, not only from controls, but also from 
      IBS-C. IBS-D also showed a significant postprandial increase in cortisol, which
      was not evident in controls or IBS-C. There was a significant correlation between
      the vagal response and the postprandial increase in GI symptoms in IBS-D (r =
      0.6, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that the IBS
      symptom groups are characterized by different physiological responses to visceral
      stimuli, and point to a role of autonomic pathways in IBS symptomatology.

TI  - Alosetron improves quality of life in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 455-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of alosetron, a
      treatment recently approved in the United States for irritable bowel syndrome in 
      diarrhea-predominant female patients, on health-related quality of life. METHODS:
      Quality of life was assessed as part of two 12-wk randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled irritable bowel syndrome studies comparing alosetron 1 mg
      b.i.d. with placebo (S3BA3001 and S3BA3002). Patients completed a validated
      disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, the Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL), at baseline and at the 12-wk or final
      visit. The clinical relevance of data were also evaluated by a minimal meaningful
      difference instrument. RESULTS: A total of 626 and 647 patients were enrolled in 
      studies S3BA3001 and S3BA3002, respectively. Approximately 70% of patients in
      each study had diarrhea-predominant IBS. In diarrhea-predominant patients
      enrolled in S3BA3001, statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements with
      alosetron versus placebo were observed on all nine IBSQOL scales (emotional
      health, mental health, sleep, energy, physical functioning, food/diet, social
      functioning, role-physical, and sexual relations) and for all but one scale
      (mental health) in S3BA3002. In both studies, a significantly greater percentage 
      of patients treated with alosetron (p < 0.05) experienced clinically meaningful
      improvement on three of the nine IBSQOL scales (food/diet, social functioning,
      and role-physical) compared with patients treated with placebo. Patients treated 
      with alosetron did not show worsening in any quality of life domain compared with
      patients treated with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results in women with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS demonstrate that alosetron significantly improves
      health-related quality of life.

TI  - Artichoke leaf extract reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in a
      post-marketing surveillance study.
PG  - 58-61
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem reported to affect 22% of the general
      population. It is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habit, but
      has so far defied elucidation of its pathogenesis and proved difficult to treat. 
      There is a growing body of evidence which indicates therapeutic properties for
      artichoke leaf extract (ALE). Dyspepsia is the condition for which the herb is
      specifically indicated, but the symptom overlap between dyspeptic syndrome and
      IBS has given rise to the notion that ALE may have potential for treating IBS as 
      well. A sub-group of patients with IBS symptoms was therefore identified from a
      sample of individuals with dyspeptic syndrome who were being monitored in a
      post-marketing surveillance study of ALE for 6 weeks. Analysis of the data from
      the IBS sub-group revealed significant reductions in the severity of symptoms and
      favourable evaluations of overall effectiveness by both physicians and patients. 
      Furthermore, 96% of patients rated ALE as better than or at least equal to
      previous therapies administered for their symptoms, and the tolerability of ALE
      was very good. These results provide support for the notion that ALE has
      potential value in relieving IBS symptoms and suggest that a controlled trial is 
      justified.

TI  - Management of the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 652-68
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder diagnosed by
      gastroenterologists and one of the more common ones encountered in general
      practice. The overall prevalence rate is similar (approximately 10%) in most
      industrialized countries; the illness has a large economic impact on health care 
      use and indirect costs, chiefly through absenteeism. IBS is a biopsychosocial
      disorder in which 3 major mechanisms interact: psychosocial factors, altered
      motility, and/or heightened sensory function of the intestine. Subtle
      inflammatory changes suggest a role for inflammation, especially after infectious
      enteritis, but this has not yet resulted in changes in the approach to patient
      treatment. Treatment of patients is based on positive diagnosis of the symptom
      complex, limited exclusion of underlying organic disease, and institution of a
      therapeutic trial. If patient symptoms are intractable, further investigations
      are needed to exclude specific motility or other disorders. Symptoms fluctuate
      over time; treatment is often restricted to times when patients experience
      symptoms. Symptomatic treatment includes supplementing fiber to achieve a total
      intake of up to 30 g in those with constipation, those taking loperamide or other
      opioids for diarrhea, and those taking low-dose antidepressants or infrequently
      using antispasmodics for pain. Older conventional therapies do not address pain
      in IBS. Behavioral psychotherapy and hypnotherapy are also being evaluated. Novel
      approaches include alosetron; a 5-HT(3) antagonist, tegaserod, a partial 5-HT(4) 
      agonist, kappa-opioid agonists, and neurokinin antagonists to address the
      remaining challenging symptoms of pain, constipation, and bloating. Understanding
      the brain-gut axis is key to the eventual development of effective therapies for 
      IBS.

PG  - 319-38
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      whose hallmark is abdominal pain or discomfort associated with a change in the
      consistency or frequency of stools. In the western world, 8% to 23% of adults
      have IBS and its socioeconomic cost is substantial. Research-generated insights
      have led to the understanding of IBS as a disorder of brain-gut regulation. The
      experience of symptoms derives from dysregulation of the bidirectional
      communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, mediated
      by neuroendocrine and immunological factors and modulated by psychosocial
      factors. The biopsychosocial model integrates the various physical and
      psychosocial factors that contribute to the patient's illness. This model and the
      recently revised symptom-based criteria (i.e. the "Rome II criteria") form the
      basis for establishing a comprehensive and effective approach for the diagnosis
      and management of the disorder.

TI  - Ischemic colitis during treatment with alosetron.
PG  - 557-60
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common entities observed by
      both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Alosetron is a potent and
      selective serotonin antagonist that recently became the first Food and Drug
      Administration-approved agent for diarrhea-predominant IBS. However, since
      approval, significant side effects have been noted with the use of alosetron
      including severe constipation, fecal impaction, and ischemic colitis. We describe
      a case of ischemic colitis in a male patient with IBS who was briefly treated
      with alosetron. Clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features of the focal
      colitis strongly suggested ischemia. Symptoms correlated temporally with
      alosetron use, and symptoms abated with discontinuation of the drug. Endoscopic
      and pathologic resolution of the colitis were documented.

TI  - An exaggerated sensory component of the gastrocolonic response in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 20-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Visceral hypersensitivity is a feature of the irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Postprandial symptoms are common in these patients. The effects
      of nutrients on colonic perception in IBS are incompletely understood. SUBJECTS: 
      We studied 13 healthy subjects and 16 patients with IBS-eight had diarrhoea
      predominant (IBS-D) and eight constipation predominant (IBS-C) IBS. METHODS:
      Colonic perception thresholds to balloon distension and viscerosomatic referral
      pattern were assessed before and after duodenal infusion of lipid or saline,
      respectively. At the end of the infusions, plasma levels of gastrointestinal
      peptides were determined. RESULTS: Lipids lowered the thresholds for first
      sensation, gas, discomfort, and pain in the IBS group but only for gas in the
      control group. The percent reduction in thresholds for gas and pain after lipids 
      was greater in the IBS and IBS-D groups but not in the IBS-C group compared with 
      controls. IBS patients had an increased area of referred discomfort and pain
      after lipids compared with before infusion whereas the referral area remained
      unchanged in controls. No group differences in colonic tone or compliance were
      observed. In both groups higher levels of cholecystokinin, pancreatic
      polypeptide, peptide YY, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and neuropeptide Y
      were seen after lipids. Motilin levels were higher in patients and differences in
      the subgroups were observed. Levels of corticotrophin releasing factor were lower
      in the constipated group than in the diarrhoea group. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial
      symptoms in IBS patients may be explained in part by a nutrient dependent
      exaggerated sensory component of the gastrocolonic response.
