TI  - Turmeric extract may improve irritable bowel syndrome symptomology in otherwise
      healthy adults: a pilot study.
PG  - 1015-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of turmeric (Curcuma longa) extract on
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptomology in otherwise healthy adults. DESIGN: 
      Partially blinded, randomized, two-dose, pilot study. SUBJECTS: Five hundred
      (500) volunteers were screened for IBS using the Rome II criteria. Two hundred
      and seven (207) suitable volunteers were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: One or two
      tablets of a standardized turmeric extract taken daily for 8 weeks. OUTCOMES
      MEASURES: IBS prevalence, symptom-related quality of life (IBSQOL) and
      self-reported effectiveness. RESULTS: IBS prevalence decreased significantly in
      both groups between screening and baseline (41% and 57%), with a further
      significant drop of 53% and 60% between baseline and after treatment, in the one-
      and two-tablet groups respectively (p < 0.001). A post-study analysis revealed
      abdominal pain/discomfort score reduced significantly by 22% and 25% in the one- 
      and two-tablet group respectively, the difference tending toward significance (p 
      = 0.071). There were significant improvements in all bar one of the IBSQOL scales
      of between 5% and 36% in both groups, approximately two thirds of all subjects
      reported an improvement in symptoms after treatment, and there was a favorable
      shift in self-reported bowel pattern. There were no significant differences
      between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Turmeric may help reduce IBS symptomology. Placebo
      controlled trials are now warranted to confirm these findings.

TI  - [Dietary intake of a group of patients with irritable bowel syndrome; relation
      between dietary fiber and symptoms].
PG  - 577-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the oral dietary intake of a
      group of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and to compare with international
      recommendations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome was enrolled in a non-propabilistic sample. Patients were diagnose
      with Roma II criteria. In all patients were determined, weight, height, body mass
      index, dietary intake of 3 days and a symptoms scoring system. RESULTS: The
      average age of 53 patients was 45.67+/-13.6 years with a distribution of sex (22 
      males/31 females). Caloric intakes was right in absolute terms and corrected by
      weight. Distribution of calories was 41.5% of carbohydrates, a 19.8% of proteins,
      and a 38.7% of lipids, showing a high intake of lipids and low of carbohydrates. 
      A low intake of vitamin A and D was detected. High intake of vitamin B12, vitamin
      C and niacine was observed. A low intake of calcium, magnesium, yodo and zinc was
      detected. Intake of soluble fiber was lower than insoluble fiber (1.46+/-0.74
      g/day) (19%) vs 6.21+/-2.67 g/day (71%). Intake of fiber corrected by calories
      was low 4.5+/-1.2 g/1000 calories. In correlation analysis, insoluble fiber
      (r=0.46; p < 0.05) and soluble fiber (r=0.42; p < 0.05) were inverse correlated
      with general symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed
      a deviation of mineral and vitamin dietary. Fiber intake is low, a correlation
      between fiber intake and general symptoms was detected.

TI  - Dietary fiber assessment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome from Northern 
      India.
PG  - 217-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the absolute fiber intake and the source of dietary fiber
      intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been lacking in
      northern Indians. OBJECTIVE: To find out the absolute fiber intake from different
      sources of food items in patients with IBS and healthy subjects from northern
      India. METHODS: Using the 72-hour recall method, dietary intake of macronutrients
      and fiber was determined in 33 consecutive adult patients with IBS and 33 age-
      and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The patients consumed lower amounts
      of macronutrients (protein 60.4 g vs 79.3 g, fat 47.7 g vs 65.7 g, and
      carbohydrates 294.6 g vs 339.8 g) and dietary fiber (8.1 g vs 15.7 g) than the
      control subjects. Though the patients consumed similar amount of pulses as the
      controls (46.6 [25.0] vs 46 [19.6] g/day), their fiber intake from pulses was
      lower (0.8 [0.7] vs 1.4 [0.9] g/day). The intake of fiber from vegetables and
      fruits was also significantly lower in patients (2.1 and 0.5 g/day, respectively)
      than in control subjects (5.8 and 3.9 g/day, respectively; p< 0.001 each).
      CONCLUSION: Total dietary fiber intake and intake of fiber from vegetables,
      fruits and pulses are lower in patients with IBS from northern India than in
      control subjects.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis: 
      a comparison of symptomatology.
PG  - 1269-72
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Both irritable bowel syndrome and some gynaecological 
      diseases can give rise to lower abdominal pain, which may result in diagnostic
      confusion. Disorders such as endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory
      disease can be diagnosed definitively only by laparoscopy, which is seldom
      undertaken in the gastroenterological setting. It was the aim of this study to
      compare the symptomatology of irritable bowel syndrome with that of
      laparoscopically confirmed chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A symptom questionnaire was administered to 50 women with
      irritable bowel syndrome and 51 gynaecological patients (30 patients with
      endometriosis, 21 patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease). As the
      symptoms of the two gynaecological conditions were so similar, the groups were
      combined for the purposes of comparison with irritable bowel syndrome. RESULTS:
      Patients with irritable bowel syndrome suffered significantly more upper
      abdominal pain, colicky pain and exacerbation of pain by food or stress. They
      also experienced more disturbance of bowel habit, distension and nausea. In
      contrast, the only gynaecological features that were more common in the
      gynaecological patients were intermenstrual bleeding, premenstrual exacerbation
      of pain and forniceal tenderness. CONCLUSION: The presence of gastrointestinal
      symptomatology, especially bowel dysfunction, in a woman with lower abdominal
      pain is suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome. However, the history may not be
      so helpful in detecting gynaecological disease.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis.
PG  - 1251-2
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common. The symptom criteria for the diagnosis 
      of IBS remain non specific. Similarly, pelvic inflammatory disease and
      endometriosis present with symptoms that may be similar to those of IBS. The site
      of pain, intermenstrual bleeding and exacerbation of symptoms by food may be able
      to help differentiate the two groups. However, there is still considerable
      overlap in the symptomatology of the two conditions and to this end both
      specialties should work together to investigate and manage these patients.

TI  - Single-blind follow-up study on the effectiveness of a symbiotic preparation in
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 169-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical studies have shown that a novel symbiotic
      (known as SCM-III) exerts a beneficial effect on gut translocation and local and 
      systemic inflammatory and microbial metabolic parameters. The present
      investigation was a preliminary trial on the effectiveness of SCM-III for
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive adult patients
      with IBS who were free from lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt
      psychiatric disorders and ongoing psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse were
      studied prospectively and divided into 2 groups that were comparable for age,
      gender, body size, education and pattern of presenting symptoms. The 2 groups
      were blindly given for 12 weeks either SCM-III 10 mL t.i.d or the same dosage of 
      heat-inactivated symbiotic. RESULTS: Treatment with SCM-III was 'effective' or
      'very effective' in more than 80% of the patients (P < 0.01 vs baseline values
      and control). Less than 5% reported 'not effective' as the final evaluation
      compared with over 40% of patients in the control group. After 6 weeks of
      treatment, a significant improvement of pain and bloating was reported in the
      treatment group compared with control and baseline values. There was also a
      benefit for bowel habits, mostly for patients with constipation or alternating
      bowel habits. No overt clinical or biochemical adverse side-effects were
      recorded. CONCLUSION: Compared with baseline values and the control group,
      SCM-III resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilla, eubacteria and
      bifidobacteria, which suggests that some selected IBS patients could benefit
      substantially from symbiotics, but the treatment may need to be given on a cyclic
      schedule because of the temporary modification of the fecal flora.

TI  - Treatment of pain symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients.
PG  - 829-36
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome represents a common gastrointestinal disorder that
      significantly impacts patients' lives. It is defined by Rome II criteria and
      characterized by abdominal pain and bloating associated with changes in bowel
      habit. Visceral hypersensitivity is currently considered a biological marker for 
      the disease. Current therapeutic treatments include the use of fiber supplements,
      antidiarrheal agents, laxatives, antispasmodics, tricyclic antidepressants and
      serotonergic agents. Through a proper understanding of the diagnostic criteria,
      pathophysiology and treatment options, this disorder can be treated effectively
      in many patients.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome creates many diagnostic and treatment difficulties in a 
      general practitioner practice as well as in a specialist practice.
      Etiopathogenesis of this illness still elicit some controversy. In a diagnostic
      process, apart from an organic basis excluding, the most important is a medical
      history of a patient because of the fact that a right symptoms interpretation
      usually allows a correct diagnosis establishment. A treatment is in its premise a
      symptomatic treatment, is long-lasting and based on a mutual trust between a
      doctor and a patient. Basic information concerning this illness is presented in
      this article.

TI  - Clostridium difficile: causes and interventions.
PG  - 547-51
AB  - Human infection with Clostridium difficile can take many forms. It can exist in
      many patients who are relatively well or who have symptoms similar to irritable
      bowel syndrome. It can also infect the patient in the acute care facility. These 
      patients typically have received antibiotics for more than 3 days and begin to
      experience foul-smelling, watery stools within a few days of initiation of
      antibiotic coverage. Good hand washing and environmental cleanliness remain the
      primary ways of preventing the spread of this infection from patient to patient. 
      The possibility of using probiotics to replace the beneficial bacteria should be 
      pursued.

AB  - Chronic constipations in elderly people proved to be an important medical and
      social problem due to their high prevalence and serious complications caused by
      the very disease and administration of stimulating laxatives. They include as
      follows: anorectic incontinence, large intestine obstruction, stercoral ulcers,
      laxative dependence and bowels toxic affection (Cathartic colon). Morphological
      and physiological prerequisites of chronic constipation and anorectic
      incontinence occurrence are examined in this review. Drugs and tactics for
      monitoring constipations depending on their severity, dominance of transit and
      evacuation disturbances, occurrence of anorectic incontinence are described.
      Characteristics of laxatives and intestinal motility regulators, range of side
      effects as well as experience of their application in elderly patients with
      functional constipations and irritable bowel syndrome are presented.

TI  - Complementary and alternative medicine in gastroenterology: the good, the bad,
      and the ugly.
PG  - 957-67
AB  - A large proportion of the American population avails itself of a variety of
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. Allopathic
      practitioners often dismiss CAM because of distrust or a belief that there is no 
      sound scientific evidence that has established its utility. However, although not
      widely appreciated, there are thousands of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      that have addressed the efficacy of CAM. We reviewed the RCTs of herbal and other
      natural products, acupuncture, and homeopathy as examples of typical CAM
      modalities, focusing on conditions of interest to gastroenterologists. Peppermint
      (alone or in combination) has supportive evidence for use in patients with
      dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and as an intraluminal spasmolytic agent
      during barium enemas or endoscopy. Ginger appeared to be effective in relieving
      nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness or pregnancy. Probiotics were useful
      in childhood diarrhea or in diarrhea due to antibiotics; one particular
      formulation (VSL#3) prevented pouchitis. Acupuncture appeared to ameliorate
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and might be useful elsewhere. There is even a 
      suggestion that homeopathy has efficacy in treatment of gastrointestinal problems
      or symptoms. The major problem in interpreting these CAM data is the generally
      low quality of the RCTs, although that quality might not be different compared to
      RCTs in the general medical literature. Gastroenterologists should become
      familiar with these techniques; it is likely that their patients already are.

TI  - Coeliac disease in Middle Eastern countries: a challenge for the evolutionary
      history of this complex disorder?
PG  - 694-7
AB  - About 10,000 years ago domestication and farming of wheat and other cereals
      developed in the 'Fertile Crescent', an area including modern Turkey, Iraq and
      Iran. Agriculture then slowly spread from Middle East to Europe. Coeliac disease 
      is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of
      wheat. It has been until relatively recently hypothesised that wheat consumption 
      exerted a negative selective pressure on genes predisposing to coeliac disease,
      eventually leading to higher coeliac disease frequency in Northeastern Europe
      because of lack of exposure to cereals. This theory is at variance with recent
      studies showing that coeliac disease is as common in Middle Eastern countries as 
      in Europe. High prevalence of coeliac disease has been found in Iran, in both the
      general population and at-risk groups, e.g. patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome or type 1 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of coeliac disease vary
      markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and the extent of disease.
      Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no
      symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat represented a major 
      component of the Iranian diet for many centuries and it may be argued that the
      continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree
      of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as
      irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. The
      gluten-free diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians in
      this area. This is particularly difficult in the absence of any supply for
      gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries.

PG  - 56-68
AB  - Probiotics have been defined by The Food Agricultural Organization/World Health
      Organization (FAO/WHO) as "live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." They have been used for
      centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of
      probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal
      recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of
      English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship 
      between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been
      reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include
      diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune
      function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive,
      hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary
      tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further
      investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these
      medical conditions.

PG  - 427-41
AB  - The management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent, yet
      challenging task in both primary care and gastroenterology practice. A diagnostic
      strategy guided by keen clinical judgment should focus on positive symptom
      criteria and on the absence of alarm symptoms. In younger patients lacking alarm 
      features, invasive testing has a low-yield. The presence of food intolerance and 
      underlying celiac disease should be excluded. The usefulness of fecal tests such 
      as calprotectin and lactoferrin to exclude organic bowel disease is not
      adequately established. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms who fail
      initial therapeutic trials, further tests can be performed in tertiary care
      settings, such as transit measurement and tests for diagnosing pelvic floor
      dysfunction. Treatment strategies for IBS are currently directed at the
      predominant symptoms. In diarrhea-predominant IBS, opioids (e.g. loperamide) and 
      the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist alosetron are efficacious. In
      constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and bulk laxatives are traditionally used,
      but their efficacy is variable and may worsen symptoms. The 5-HT(4) receptor
      agonist tegaserod is efficacious in female patients with IBS and constipation. In
      patients with IBS and abdominal pain, antispasmodics and antidepressants can be
      used, with the best evidence supporting the prescription of tricyclic
      antidepressants. The efficacy of psychological treatments in terms of relieving
      the symptoms of IBS is still uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that
      anti-enkephalinase agents, somatostatin analogues, alpha(2)-receptor agonists,
      opioid antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, probiotics and
      herbal treatments may be useful in IBS patients.

TI  - Lactose malabsorption in a population with irritable bowel syndrome: prevalence
      and symptoms. A case-control study.
PG  - 645-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms after intake of milk are common in persons with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). The aims of this study were to compare the prevalence of
      lactose malabsorption (LM) and symptoms related to intake of milk and lactose in 
      subjects with IBS with that of healthy volunteers, and to search for symptoms
      that are characteristic of LM. METHODS: A case-control study in a Norwegian
      population was initiated. Subjects with IBS were asked for symptoms related to
      intake of milk and lactose, tested for LM, and compared with a group of healthy
      volunteers. RESULTS: The study comprised a total of 187 persons (82 with IBS and 
      105 volunteers), females/males: 138/49, mean age 47 years. In subjects with IBS
      and in healthy volunteers, LM was present in 3/74 (4.1%) and 4/105 (3.8%),
      respectively (ns), milk-related symptoms in 32/79 (40%) and 13/105 (12%),
      respectively (P < 0.001) and symptoms after intake of lactose in 28/74 (38%) and 
      21/104 (20%), respectively (P=0.01). Borborygmi starting within 5 h after intake 
      of lactose and lasting for more than 2 h indicated LM (OR 61 (95% CI: 8-475), P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IBS and LM are unrelated disorders in a Norwegian
      population. Milk-related symptoms and symptoms after intake of lactose are
      unreliable predictors for LM. Precise symptom-based criteria might enhance the
      diagnostic accuracy for LM.

TI  - Food elimination based on IgG antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome: a
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1459-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often feel they have
      some form of dietary intolerance and frequently try exclusion diets. Tests
      attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing but none
      has utilised IgG antibodies. AIMS: To assess the therapeutic potential of dietary
      elimination based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food. PATIENTS: A total of
      150 outpatients with IBS were randomised to receive, for three months, either a
      diet excluding all foods to which they had raised IgG antibodies (enzyme linked
      immunosorbant assay test) or a sham diet excluding the same number of foods but
      not those to which they had antibodies. METHODS: Primary outcome measures were
      change in IBS symptom severity and global rating scores. Non-colonic
      symptomatology, quality of life, and anxiety/depression were secondary outcomes. 
      Intention to treat analysis was undertaken using a generalised linear model.
      RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the true diet resulted in a 10% greater reduction in
      symptom score than the sham diet (mean difference 39 (95% confidence intervals
      (CI) 5-72); p = 0.024) with this value increasing to 26% in fully compliant
      patients (difference 98 (95% CI 52-144); p<0.001). Global rating also
      significantly improved in the true diet group as a whole (p = 0.048, NNT = 9) and
      even more in compliant patients (p = 0.006, NNT = 2.5). All other outcomes showed
      trends favouring the true diet. Relaxing the diet led to a 24% greater
      deterioration in symptoms in those on the true diet (difference 52 (95% CI
      18-88); p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be
      effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.

TI  - Food allergy in irritable bowel syndrome: new facts and old fallacies.
PG  - 1391-3
AB  - The notion of food allergy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not new. However,
      recent evidence suggests significant reduction in IBS symptom severity in
      patients on elimination diets, provided that dietary elimination is based on
      foods against which the individual had raised IgG antibodies. These findings
      should encourage studies dissecting the mechanisms responsible for IgG production
      against dietary antigens and their putative role in IBS

TI  - Probiotics and human health: a clinical perspective.
PG  - 516-26
AB  - There is unequivocal evidence that administration of probiotics could be
      effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea in children and the
      prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and nosocomial/community acquired
      diarrhoea. Encouraging evidence is also emerging for the effectiveness of
      probiotics in the prevention and management of pouchitis and paediatric atopic
      diseases, and the prevention of postoperative infections. There is also strong
      evidence that certain probiotic strains are able to enhance immune function,
      especially in subjects with less than adequate immune function such as the
      elderly. Efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of traveller's diarrhoea,
      sepsis associated with severe acute pancreatitis, and cancers, the management of 
      ulcerative colitis, and lowering of blood cholesterol remains unproven. In
      addition to firm evidence of efficacy (for a range of conditions), major gaps
      exist in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which probiotics modulate
      various physiological functions and the optimum dose, frequency, and duration of 
      treatment for different probiotic strains.

TI  - Artichoke leaf extract reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and improves 
      quality of life in otherwise healthy volunteers suffering from concomitant
      dyspepsia: a subset analysis.
PG  - 667-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Does artichoke leaf extract (ALE) ameliorate symptoms of Irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) in otherwise healthy volunteers suffering concomitant
      dyspepsia? METHODS: A subset analysis of a previous dose-ranging, open, postal
      study, in adults suffering dyspepsia. Two hundred and eight (208) adults were
      identified post hoc as suffering with IBS. IBS incidence, self-reported usual
      bowel pattern, and the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) were compared before and
      after a 2-month intervention period. RESULTS: There was a significant fall in IBS
      incidence of 26.4% (p < 0.001) after treatment. A significant shift in
      self-reported usual bowel pattern away from "alternating constipation/diarrhea"
      toward "normal" (p < 0.001) was observed. NDI total symptom score significantly
      decreased by 41% (p < 0.001) after treatment. Similarly, there was a significant 
      20% improvement in the NDI total quality-of-life (QOL) score in the subset after 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: This report supports previous findings that ALE
      ameliorates symptoms of IBS, plus improves health-related QOL.

TI  - Diagnosis and therapy of irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 10-22
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gut functional diseases,
      affecting 10-20% of people worldwide. Although most patients do not seek medical 
      help, the disease accounts for huge costs for both patients and health-care
      systems and worsens significantly patients' quality of life. Diagnosis is based
      on the identification of symptoms according to Manning, Rome I and Rome II
      criteria and exclusion of alarm indicators. IBS symptoms overlap with those of
      coeliac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies and bile salt malabsorption.
      The treatment of IBS is centred on an excellent doctor-patient relationship along
      with drugs targeting the predominant symptom, especially during exacerbations.
      Current pharmacological remedies are unsatisfactory due to the high number of
      patients complaining of lack of response and/or symptom recurrence. Although
      useful in some IBS patients, the validity of psychotherapy deserves further
      investigation. A wide array of potentially useful drugs are currently under
      consideration in pre-clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenetic 
      mechanisms underlying IBS may help to develop more effective drugs for this
      disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of dietary fiber on symptoms of irritable 
      bowel syndrome. METHODS: A single-blind randomized clinical trial was designed.
      Fifty-six subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were prospectively and randomly 
      assigned to one of two groups: group 1 received a diet containing 10.4 g/d of
      fiber and group 2 received a diet containing 30.5 g/d of fiber. Patients' body
      weights, nutritional intakes as assessed with 3-d written food records, and
      symptom scores were assessed at baseline and at 3 mo. RESULTS: There were no
      dropouts during the study. Total energy intake and the distribution of
      macronutrients were not significantly different between groups. Total dietary
      fiber intake did not reach recommended levels in either group but was higher in
      group 2 than in group 1 (25.95 +/- 2.12 g/d versus 6.06 +/- 2.7 g/d, P < 0.05).
      Initial fiber intake did not differ significantly between groups. Pain scores,
      bowel scores, and general scores improved in both groups (from baseline to 3 mo),
      and no significant differences were detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A
      modest fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome relieved symptoms, 
      but this therapeutic benefit of fiber may have been due to a placebo effect
      because the results were similar in the low-fiber group.

TI  - Treatment options in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 773-86
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is part of the spectrum of functional bowel
      disorders characterised by a diverse consortium of abdominal symptoms including
      abdominal pain, altered bowel function (bowel frequency and/or constipation),
      bloating, abdominal distension, the sensation of incomplete evacuation and the
      increased passage of mucus. It is not surprising therefore that no single,
      unifying mechanism has as yet been put forward to explain symptom production in
      IBS. The currently favoured model includes both central and end-organ components 
      which may be combined to create an integrated hypothesis incorporating
      psychological factors (stress, distress, affective disorder) with end-organ
      dysfunction (motility disorder, visceral hypersensitivity) possibly aggravated by
      sub-clinical inflammation as a residuum of an intestinal infection. There is
      currently no universally effective therapy for IBS. Standard therapy generally
      involves a symptom-directed approach; anti-diarrhoeal agents for bowel frequency,
      soluble fibre or laxatives for constipation and smooth muscle relaxants and
      anti-spasmodics for pain. New drug development has focused predominantly on
      agents that modify the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the gut,
      principally the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for painful diarrhoea predominant
      IBS and 5-HT(4) agonists for constipation predominant IBS. More speculative new
      therapeutic approaches include anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, probiotics,
      antagonists of CCK1 receptors, tachykinins and other novel neuronal receptors.

TI  - [Natural therapy instead of chemistry? Probiotics in gastroenterology].
PG  - 13-7
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that upon ingestion exert health benefits.
      The impact of probiotics on gut flora represents a new and interesting
      therapeutic approach in a number of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
      According to actual publications and guidelines of medical societies, the
      clinical relevance of probiotics can be described as follows: (a) In the case of 
      ulcerative colitis, available data demonstrate benefits of probiotic therapy. (b)
      The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect
      seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics
      is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before 
      probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome
      have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been
      encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and
      therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.

TI  - The causes of intestinal dysbiosis: a review.
PG  - 180-97
AB  - Alterations in the bowel flora and its activities are now believed to be
      contributing factors to many chronic and degenerative diseases. Irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing
      spondylitis have all been linked to alterations in the intestinal microflora. The
      intestinal dysbiosis hypothesis suggests a number of factors associated with
      modern Western living have a detrimental impact on the microflora of the
      gastrointestinal tract. Factors such as antibiotics, psychological and physical
      stress, and certain dietary components have been found to contribute to
      intestinal dysbiosis. If these causes can be eliminated or at least attenuated
      then treatments aimed at manipulating the microflora may be more successful

TI  - Bacteriotherapy using fecal flora: toying with human motions.
PG  - 475-83
AB  - The intestinal flora may play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Components of bowel flora such as Lactobacillus
      acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus have long been used empirically as
      therapeutic agents for GI disorders. More complex combinations of probiotics for 
      therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most
      elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire
      fecal flora. Fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a
      therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. This type of bacteriotherapy
      has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically
      against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort
      for patients with severe Clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent
      diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. Encouraging results have also
      been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation.
      The therapeutic use of fecal bacteriotherapy is reviewed here and possible
      mechanisms of action and potential applications explored. Published reports on
      fecal bacteriotherapy are few in number, and detail the results of small
      uncontrolled open studies and case reports. Nevertheless, given the promising
      clinical responses, formal research into fecal bacteriotherapy is now warranted.

PG  - S104-6
AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) may be diagnosed on the presence of symptoms,
      according to Rome II criteria, [corrected] and some studies have shown that
      abnormal colonic fermentation may be an important factor in the development of
      symptoms in some patients with IBS. Since the fermentation [corrected] of
      substrates by the intestinal flora may play a key role in the use of probiotics
      in the treatment of IBS, seventy [corrected] patients (31 [corrected] males, 39
      [corrected] females), mean age 40 years (range = 26-64 years) with IBS, according
      to Rome II criteria, were enrolled into the study after informed consensus.
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive for 4 weeks [corrected] either the
      active preparation containing Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 [corrected] and
      Bifidobacterium breve BR 03 [corrected] or Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 and
      Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 02, all strains at concentrations of 5 x 10(9)
      CFU/g) [corrected] or placebo powder containing starch identical to the study
      product [corrected] To evaluate treatment efficacy two different scores were
      considered [corrected] Pain score in different abdominal locations after
      treatment decreased in probiotics groups A and B 42% and 49% versus 25%
      [corrected] (P < 0.05) in [corrected] placebo group after 14 days and 45% and 49%
      versus 29.5% [corrected] (P < 0.001) after 28 days. The severity score of
      characteristic IBD symptoms significantly decreased in probiotic groups A and B
      [corrected] versus placebo group after 14 days, 49.3% and 55.6% [corrected]
      versus 8% [corrected] (P < 0.001), and these data were confirmed after 28 days
      (56% and 55.6% versus 14.4% [corrected] P < 0.001). In conclusion, short-term
      therapy with Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 and Bifidobacterium breve BR 03 or
      Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 02 [corrected] may
      be considered a promising approach for IBS therapy [corrected]

TI  - Tolerance of probiotics and prebiotics.
PG  - S67-9
AB  - The clinical efficacy of probiotics and prebiotics has been proved in several
      clinical settings. The authors review their proved or potential side effects.
      Probiotics as living microorganisms may theoretically be responsible for 4 types 
      of side effects in susceptible individuals: infections, deleterious metabolic
      activities, excessive immune stimulation, and gene transfer. Very few cases of
      infection have been observed. These occurred mainly in very sick patients who
      received probiotic drugs because of severe medical conditions. Prebiotics exert
      an osmotic effect in the intestinal lumen and are fermented in the colon. They
      may induce gaseousness and bloating. Abdominal pain and diarrhea only occur with 
      large doses. An increase in gastroesophageal reflux has recently been associated 
      with large daily doses. Tolerance depends on the dose and individual sensitivity 
      factors (probably the presence of irritable bowel syndrome or gastroesophageal
      reflux), and may be an adaptation to chronic consumption.

PG  - 353-9
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. The prevalence rate is 10-20% and women have a higher
      prevalence. IBS adversely affects quality of life and is associated with health
      care use and costs. IBS comprises a group of functional bowel disorders in which 
      abdominal discomfort or pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel
      habit, and with features of disordered defecation. The consensus definition and
      criteria for IBS have been formalized in the "Rome II criteria". Food,
      psychiatric disorders, and gastroenteritis are risk factors for developing IBS.
      The mechanism in IBS involves biopsychosocial disorders; psychosocial factors,
      altered motility, and heightened sensory function. Brain-gut interaction is the
      most important in understanding the pathophysiology of IBS. Effective management 
      requires an effective physician-patient relationship. Dietary treatment,
      lifestyle therapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapy play a major
      role in treating IBS. Calcium polycarbophil can benefit IBS patients with
      constipation or alternating diarrhea and constipation.

AB  - An increased traffic of circulating CD34+ Hemopoietic Precursors Cells (HPC) is
      an important feature of systemic allergic inflammation. Bacteria and bacterial
      products are capable of stimulating the transcription of the maturational
      cytokines IL12 and IFNs through the activation of Toll-Like-Receptor and the
      subsequent nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB factor. In this study the

      investigated. Fourteen consecutive subjects, 9M and 5F, aged 6-48, with clinical 
      symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic
      dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled.
      Allergen-specific serum IgE were found in twelve patients. Flow-cytometric
      measurement of peripheral blood CD34dim/bright HPC values were assessed before
      and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet
      a day of ENDOLAC (UCB Pharma, Turin, Italy). Each sachet contained a mixture of
      Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus for a
      total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. Circulating CD34+ cell values significantly (p 
      < 0.001) reduced after the treatment. ENDOLAC, thus, may improve the efficacy of 
      the standard treatments of allergic diseases.

TI  - Epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease: a general population-based study
      in Xi'an of Northwest China.
PG  - 1647-51
AB  - AIM: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder in the Western
      population, but detailed population-based data in China are limited. The aim of
      this study was to understand the epidemiology of symptomatic gastroesophageal
      reflux (SGER) in adults of Xi'an, a northwestern city of China, and to explore
      the potential risk factors of GERD. METHODS: Symptoms suggestive of GERD,
      functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), upper respiratory
      diseases and some potential risk factors were investigated in a face-to-face
      manner in a region-stratified random samples of 2789 residents aged 18-70 years
      in Xi'an by using a standardized questionnaire. METHODS: With a response rate of 
      91.8%, the prevalence of SGER was 16.98% (95% CI, 14.2-18.92) in Xi'an adults,
      and no gender-related difference was observed (P<0.05). SGER was more common
      among subjects aged 30-70 years than in those aged 18-29 years (P<0.01). The
      prevalence of SGER in rural, urban and suburban subjects was 21.07%, 17.44% and
      12.12%, respectively, and there was a significant difference between rural, urban
      and suburban regions (P<0.05). Compared with subjects without SGER, the
      prevalence of symptoms suggestive of FD and IBS, pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis,
      laryngitis, pharyngitis, chronic cough, wheeze, globus sensation, oral ulcer and 
      snore was significantly increased in subjects with SGER (P<0.01). Heavy smoking
      (OR=5.76; CI, 3.70-6.67), heavy alcohol use (OR=2.85; CI, 1.67-4.49), peptic
      ulcer (OR=5.76; CI, 3.99-8.32), cerebral palsy (OR=3.97; CI, 1.97-8.00),
      abdominal operation (OR=2.69; CI, 1.75-4.13), obesity (OR=2.16; CI, 1.47-3.16),
      excessive food intake (OR=1.43; CI, 1.17-1.15), sweet food (OR=1.23; CI,
      0.89-1.54), and consumption of coffee (OR=1.23; CI, 0.17-2.00) were independently
      associated with SGER. The episodes of GERD were commonly precipitated by dietary 
      factors (66.05%), followed by body posture (26.54%), ill temper (23.72%), fatigue
      (22.32%) and stress (10.93%). CONCLUSION: GERD is common in Xi'an's adult
      population with a mild or moderate degree. The etiology and pathogenesis of GERD 
      are probably associated with FD, IBS, and some respiratory, laryngopharyngeal and
      odontostological diseases or symptoms. Some lifestyles, diseases and dietary
      factors are the risk factors of GERD.

TI  - Update in the pharmaceutical therapy of the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 374-81
AB  - The therapeutic management of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is ineffective
      and not satisfying either patients or practitioners. Research in functions of the
      enteric nervous system and its interaction with the central nervous system is the
      basis for the development of emerging pharmaceuticals in therapy of the IBS.
      These pharmaceuticals include agents such as opioid agonists, psychotropic agents
      and particularly serotonin receptor modulators. These novel pharmaceuticals aim
      to provide a more comprehensive approach in the therapy of the IBS and will serve
      both patients and practitioners. So far, the US Food and Drug Administration has 
      approved two agents specifically for the treatment of the IBS, both belonging to 
      the group of serotonin receptor modulators. However, questions remain whether a
      single therapy is sufficient in the management of IBS because this disease is
      influenced by biological and psychological as well as cultural and social
      factors.

TI  - A population-based epidemiologic study of irritable bowel syndrome in South
      China: stratified randomized study by cluster sampling.
PG  - 1217-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detailed population-based data on irritable bowel syndrome in
      South China are lacking. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of irritable bowel
      syndrome in South China and its impact on health-related quality of life.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A face-to-face interview was carried out in South China to 
      assess the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome. Random clustered sampling of
      permanent inhabitants aged 18-80 years was carried out under stratification of
      urban and suburban areas. The impact of irritable bowel syndrome on
      health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Chinese version of SF-36. 
      RESULTS: A total of 4178 subjects (1907 male and 2271 female) were interviewed.
      The adjusted prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South China is 11.50%
      according to the Manning criteria and 5.67% according to the Rome II criteria.
      Factors including history of analgesic use such as non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (odds ratio 3.83), history of food allergies (odds ratio
      2.68), psychological distress (odds ratio 2.18), life events (odds ratio 1.89),
      history of dysentery (odds ratio 1.63) and negative coping style (odds ratio
      1.28) were significantly associated with the presence of irritable bowel syndrome
      (P < 0.05). Irritable bowel syndrome was significantly associated with a
      decrement in health-related quality of life score. CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel
      syndrome is a common disorder in South China and has a negative impact on
      health-related quality of life.

TI  - Paroxetine to treat irritable bowel syndrome not responding to high-fiber diet: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 914-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the trial was to determine whether a high-fiber diet
      (HFD) alone or in combination with paroxetine or placebo was effective treatment 
      for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: DESIGN: Trial of HFD
      alone (Group 1) followed by a randomized, double-blind trial of HFD with
      paroxetine or placebo (Group 2). SETTING: Gastroenterology office in a 524-bed
      university-affiliated community hospital in Pittsburgh. PATIENTS: Men and women, 
      aged 18-65 yr, previously diagnosed with IBS but otherwise healthy. INTERVENTION:
      Institution of HFD in 98 participants consuming low- or average-fiber diets.
      Allocation of paroxetine to 38 and placebo to 43 symptomatic participants
      consuming HFDs. MEASUREMENTS: Overall well-being, abdominal pain, and abdominal
      bloating (Groups 1 and 2); food avoidance, work functioning, and social
      functioning (Group 2). RESULTS: In Group 1, overall well-being improved in 26%
      patients, and abdominal pain and bloating decreased in 22% and 26% patients,
      respectively, with an HFD. In Group 2, overall well-being improved more with
      paroxetine than with placebo (63.3%vs 26.3%; p= 0.01), but abdominal pain,
      bloating, and social functioning did not. With paroxetine, food avoidance
      decreased (p= 0.03) and work functioning was marginally better (p= 0.08). Before 
      unblinding, more paroxetine recipients than placebo recipients wanted to continue
      their study medication (84%vs 37%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in
      overall well-being found in our paroxetine/placebo trial is greater than that
      found in previously published drug/placebo trials for IBS. Moreover, the
      difference in well-being applied to nondepressed recipients of paroxetine.

TI  - Microbial-gut interactions in health and disease. Irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - The intestinal microbiota interacts with several aspects of gastrointestinal
      function that may affect the expression or progression of disease. For example, a
      role for bacterial metabolism of bile acids and food has been linked to
      colorectal cancer development. Studies have also shown a potential role of the
      intestinal microbiota in the modulation of inflammation in the intestine and
      joints. Normal gut physiology is molded by the interaction between the intestinal
      microbiota and the host's gastrointestinal tissues, including motility,
      absorption and secretion, and intestinal permeability. Early studies in axenic
      mice demonstrated gross morphological abnormalities and gut motor dysfunction
      related to the absence of a normal microflora, raising the possibility that
      shifts in commensal bacterial populations could play a role in the development of
      altered motility states including functional disorders of the gut. This chapter
      concentrates on the experimental evidence for a role of intestinal microbiota and
      the potential therapeutic value of probiotics in functional diseases such as
      irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - During a meeting in The Hague, The Netherlands, the IBiS Club evaluated the most 
      important techniques that can be used in the investigation of irritable bowel
      syndrome, either in the context of scientific research or as a clinical
      diagnostic tool. In each of these, the relevance of findings made in irritable
      bowel syndrome was balanced against the applicability of the technique. The
      discussion of the group is summarized in this paper.

TI  - Correlation between symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome and the response to 
      the food extract skin prick test.
PG  - 659-62
AB  - The relationship between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and food intolerance 
      is not clear. We studied the cutaneous response to food antigens in 43 volunteers
      who were students and employees of the Faculty of Medicine of Universidade
      Federal Fluminense. Subjects were divided into 3 groups after evaluation for Roma
      II criteria for functional disease of the gastrointestinal tract: group I, 14
      volunteers with IBS; group II, 15 volunteers with functional dyspepsia; group
      III, 14 volunteers without habitual gastrointestinal symptoms. The subjects were 
      submitted to the skin prick test with 9 food antigen extracts, for a total of 387
      skin tests (9 per volunteer). Of the 126 tests applied to group I, 24 (19.4%)
      were positive (a 3-mm wider papule than the negative control) and of the 135
      tests applied to group II, 3 (2.3%) were positive. Of the 126 tests applied to
      group III, 6 (4%) were positive. The number of positive responses obtained in
      group I (IBS) differed significantly from the other 2 groups (P < 0.01). None of 
      the volunteers with IBS reported intolerance to any isolated food. The higher
      reactivity to food antigens in group I compared to groups II and III suggests
      that intestinal permeability may be increased in patients with IBS.

TI  - Are there alterations of neuroendocrine and cellular immune responses to
      nutrients in women with irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 703-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal was to investigate the neuroimmune axis in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) by analyzing the neuroendocrine and cellular immune responses to
      nutrient load. METHODS: In the fasting state and 20, 40, 70, and 100 min
      following nutrient load, blood samples were collected and cardiovascular
      recordings were accomplished in 15 female IBS patients and 15 healthy women.
      Plasma norepinephrine, prolactin, cortisol, and growth hormone were analyzed, and
      blood pressure and heart rate responses were measured. The distribution of
      peripheral leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations and the in vitro production
      of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after whole
      blood stimulation with in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were analyzed. RESULTS: IBS
      patients demonstrated significantly greater postprandial increases in plasma
      norepinephrine and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), but no cortisol response. 
      A postprandial redistribution of circulating leukocytes and lymphocyte
      subpopulations was observed in both groups, including significant increases in
      the numbers of leukocytes and granulocytes and significant decreases in the
      numbers of monocytes, T-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (all p < 0.05).
      However, IBS patients demonstrated significantly greater postprandial increases
      in leukocytes and granulocytes, while changes in the numbers of monocytes and NK 
      cells were significantly diminished (all p < 0.05). Patients also failed to show 
      the postprandial decrease in the in vitro TNF-alpha production observed in
      controls. Postprandial norepinephrine concentrations were negatively correlated
      with NK cell numbers in IBS patients (r= 0.58, p < 0.05) but not controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: IBS may involve an autonomic hyper-responsiveness to visceral
      stimuli, which occurs throughout the entire gut, is independent of acutely
      perceived GI symptoms, and does not necessarily involve HPA axis activation.
      Women with IBS show altered cellular immune responses to food intake, which may
      at least in part be mediated by adrenergic mechanisms. Thus, autonomic
      disturbances may have implications for cellular immune function along the
      neuroendocrine-immune axis in patients with IBS.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome in women: a common health problem.
PG  - 69-81
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is a common but complex problem that disproportionately 
      affects women. Nurses are ideally situated to provide accurate information
      regarding the disorder and to provide symptom management. Currently, the
      diagnosis is based on the presence of abdominal pain and alterations in bowel
      habits. A multicomponent approach beginning with education and reassurance is
      more likely to be effective than one focused on a predominant symptoms (eg.,
      constipation) alone. Building a therapeutic relationship with the patient over
      time will likely enhance the effectiveness of the prescribed therapy. Treatment
      paradigms that include new drugs that affect more than one symptom of IBS, along 
      with nondrug therapies (eg, relaxation and cognitive behavioral strategies), will
      likely hold the greatest promise for management.

TI  - [A population-based epidemiologic study of irritable bowel syndrome in Guangdong 
      province].
PG  - 278-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its
      risk factors in Guangdong province. METHODS: A questionnaire was used to screen
      IBS by face-to-face interviews according to Manning (modified including symptoms 
      of constipation) and Rome II criteria. Random clustered sampling involving
      permanent inhabitants aged 18 - 80 years was carried out under stratification of 
      urban and suburban areas. Potential risk factors were explored by comparing the
      frequencies among IBS group and non-IBS group using chi(2) and logistic analysis 
      of multivariate adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 4178 residents
      (male 1907, female 2271) were investigated. Mean age among the responders was (43
      +/- 14) years. The response rate was 98%. The adjusted prevalence of IBS in
      Guangdong province is 5.67% according to the modified Rome II criteria, and is
      11.50% according to Manning criteria. There is no difference between urban and
      suburban areas. The female was predominant in IBS, and the ratio of male to
      female was 1:1.25 (Rome II) and 1:1.34 (Manning). The age was poorly correlated
      with the prevalence. Events including history of analgesic use such as NSAID (OR 
      = 3.83), history of food allergies (OR = 2.68), psychological distress (OR =
      2.18), life events (OR = 1.89), history of dysentery (OR = 1.63) and negative
      coping style (OR = 1.28) are highly associated with IBS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      IBS is a common disorder in Guangdong Province which deserves greater care and
      further investigation.

TI  - Alternative approach to IBS and migraine is winning over providers.
PG  - 6-10, 1
AB  - Many clinicians have long suspected that symptoms of IBS are somehow related to
      diet. In fact, research conducted over many years in Europe suggests than many
      cases of IBS are, in fact, the result of inflammatory reactions to specific foods
      or ingredients. Further, some cases of migraine appear to be linked to food
      intolerances as well. Now, a company in Florida has developed a DM program that
      can pinpoint specific cases of food intolerance and create an individualized
      program for eliminating symptoms.

TI  - Relationship of bloating to other GI and menstrual symptoms in women with
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 88-95
AB  - This report examines the relationships between bloating and other symptoms in
      young women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), using both retrospective and
      daily diary measures of symptoms. Of the 195 IBS women, 147 (75%) reported
      retrospectively that they often feel bloated and distended. Across-women analyses
      of both retrospective and daily diary data show that bloating is most strongly
      associated with constipation, abdominal pain, and intestinal gas. Within-woman
      analyses of daily symptoms also show a strong association of bloating with
      abdominal pain and intestinal gas (i.e., abdominal pain and intestinal gas are
      higher on days when bloating is higher) but only a weak association with
      constipation. Bloating is strongly associated with uterine cramping and breast
      tenderness, but only when perimenses days are included in the analysis. In
      conclusion, bloating is a very common symptom in women with IBS that is most
      strongly related to abdominal pain and intestinal gas but may be confounded with 
      menses-associated symptoms.

TI  - Systematic review: the role of different types of fibre in the treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a
      bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of
      irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may
      have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal
      transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in
      several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre
      in irritable bowel syndrome management. AIM: To quantify the effect of different 
      types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome.
      METHODS: Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected
      randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated 
      with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using
      soluble and insoluble fibre separately. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included 
      in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome
      patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable
      bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive
      benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there 
      was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in
      irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different 
      effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium,
      ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 
      1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some
      cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference
      compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for
      global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel
      syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different
      effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases,
      insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies
      evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary
      care.

TI  - Probiotics in gastroenterology: indications and future perspectives.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the
      intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several
      gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been
      disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated
      with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii.
      Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits
      have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea.
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized 
      by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which
      probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and 
      Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce
      relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses
      has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies
      probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for
      probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are
      inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption.
      Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of
      colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this
      disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been
      reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled
      studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use
      can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and
      duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available
      probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be
      elucidated.

TI  - Acute diverticulitis of the colon--current medical therapeutic management.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - Diverticular disease of the colon is very common in developed countries with its 
      prevalence increasing with age, varying from < 10% in those < 40 years of age, to
      an estimated 50-66% of patients > 80 years of age. Diverticulitis, defined as
      inflammation and/or infection associated with diverticula, is the most common
      clinical complication of this disorder, affecting an estimated 10-25% of patients
      with colonic diverticula. The therapeutic measures aim at putting the intestine
      'at rest', thus resolving the infection, the consequences of the inflammation and
      preventing or limiting complications. For patients with severe and complicated
      diverticulitis, ampicillin, gentamicin, metronidazole, piperacillin and
      tazobactam are the antibiotics successfully used in clinical practice, whereas
      ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and more recently, rifaximin, have been successfully
      used in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticular disease. Mesalazine (alone or
      in association with antibiotics) and probiotics are the two latest therapies for 
      the treatment of diverticulitis which have been developed in the last few years. 
      In fact, the combination of mesalazine and an antibiotic showed significant
      superiority in improving the severity of symptoms, bowel habits and in preventing
      symptomatic recurrence of diverticulitis than antibiotics alone, but probiotics
      also seem to be effective in preventing recurrence of the disease. In light of
      the excellent results obtained in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome, it is probable that probiotics may be the future best
      treatment also for mild-to-moderate uncomplicated attacks of acute
      diverticulitis, especially if used with salycilates.

TI  - Probiotics: Isolated bacteria strain or mixtures of different strains? Two
      different approaches in the use of probiotics as therapeutics.
PG  - 565-97
AB  - Probiotics are cultures of beneficial bacteria from the healthy gut microflora
      that improve the balance of the intestinal milieu by modifying the intestinal
      microflora and suppressing enhanced inflammatory responses. Probiotics are
      currently the subject of intense and widespread research as functional foods
      since they are known to induce health benefits, may be used as pharmaceutical
      preparations, and have achieved a "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) status.
      Lactobacillus strains can also be genetically engineered for use in oral
      immunotherapeutic applications, such as vaccination and delivery of
      immunoregulatory substances. In the present review we evaluate the two different 
      approaches to the therapeutic use of probiotics. We also focus on recent findings
      in the field of molecular biology and genetics of the intestinal immune response 
      related to the microflora and intestinal ecology, in order to understand the
      mechanisms of action of probiotics and their present indications in
      gastrointestinal diseases. Finally, with a view to future perspectives we provide
      some examples of probiotics that are being assessed and have great potential in
      improving the health of animals and man.

TI  - Role of alimentation in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 225-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different food items are made responsible for irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but the physiopathology of IBS remains unclear. AIMS:
      During a meeting in Nice, France, experts of the European Working Team of the
      IBiS Club discussed selected data regarding the relationships between
      alimentation, food items (including fibers) and IBS symptoms. METHODS/RESULTS:
      Food allergy remains a difficult diagnosis, but medical and general history,
      presence of general symptoms such as skin rash, and hypersensitivity tests may
      help in achieving a positive diagnosis. On the other hand, food intolerance is
      more confusing because of the subjectivity of the relationship between ingestion 
      of certain foods and the appearance of clinical symptoms. Different food items
      which are commonly implicated in adverse reactions mimicking IBS were found to be
      stimulants for the gut, suggesting that patients with predominant diarrhea IBS
      have to be carefully questioned about consumption of different kinds of food
      (i.e., coffee, alcohol, chewing gum, soft drinks) and not only on lactose
      ingestion. Gas production is discussed on the basis of retention of intestinal
      gas as well as on malabsorption of fermentable substrates. The role of a large
      amount of this kind of substrate reaching the colon is suggested as a potential
      mechanism of IBS-type symptoms in overeating patients. Regarding the role of
      fiber in IBS, the expert group concluded that fibers are not inert substances and
      that they could trigger pain or bloating in some IBS patients. CONCLUSION:
      Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general
      dietary advice to IBS patients, but dieteticians may have a positive role in
      managing such patients.

TI  - Alosetron in irritable bowel syndrome: strategies for its use in a common
      gastrointestinal disorder.
PG  - 1895-905
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder
      characterised by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence
      of any discernible structural, biochemical and physiological abnormalities.
      Although there is no specific biological marker for the diagnosis of this
      disorder, recently developed symptom-based criteria provide the tools necessary
      to make a diagnosis. The precise underlying pathophysiology of IBS remains
      unknown. However, disturbances in the brain-gut axis involving the central
      nervous system and the enteric nervous system have emerged as an underlying
      concept for IBS. In this regard, conventional treatment has been recognised as
      unsatisfactory for many patients with IBS and novel, neuroenteric modulatory
      compounds have been introduced for use by clinicians. Specifically, compounds
      interacting with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT3
      and 5-HT4 subtype have been demonstrated of benefit in some patients for the
      treatment of IBS. In this leading article, we present the current data on the
      pharmacology, clinical trials, indications and adverse effects of alosetron, a
      potent and selective 5-HT3 antagonist. As a result of the recognition of serious 
      adverse effects, the indication for alosetron has been restricted and it is now
      indicated only for women with severe diarrhoea-predominant IBS who have symptoms 
      for at least 6 months and who have failed to respond to conventional therapy.
      Prescribing restrictions and the risk-management programme implemented as
      required by the US FDA is reviewed along with a summary of the studies to be
      performed after reintroduction of alosetron to monitor safety.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in female health.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - Functional foods such as probiotics, prebiotics and nutraceuticals are of extreme
      interest to researchers. There is growing evidence that these food ingredients
      may improve and in some cases treat certain conditions that are implicated in
      women's health. The use of probiotics (live, beneficial bacteria) in improving
      gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal tract conditions such as irritable
      bowel syndrome, candidiasis and other female urogenital tract conditions are
      reviewed. Emphasis is also given to the importance of prebiotics (non-digestible 
      food ingredients) in osteoporosis management and alleviation of menopausal
      symptoms and reducing the onset of cancer.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome in primary care: the patients' and doctors' views on
      symptoms, etiology and management.
PG  - 363-8; quiz 405-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To facilitate the development of clinical guidelines and to direct
      future irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) research, insight into the perceptions of
      patients and general practitioners (GPs) regarding IBS is required. OBJECTIVES:
      To compare patients' and GPs' views on the symptomatology, etiology and treatment
      of IBS. METHODS: One hundred forty-two IBS patients and 100 GPs were requested to
      complete a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rates of the patients 
      and GPs were 80% and 47%, respectively. Abdominal pain and bloating were
      considered to be the most bothersome symptoms in IBS, by both patients and GPs.
      Although all patients were diagnosed by their GP as having IBS, and 62% met the
      Manning criteria, only 18% fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. Patients
      consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main etiologic
      dietary factor. Many IBS patients expect a diagnostic work-up, but GPs generally 
      restrict this to elderly patients. GPs start IBS management with dietary advice
      (94%), counselling (77%) and drug therapy (55%). Patients expect reassurance
      (47%) and drug treatment (37%), but dietary interventions are less appreciated
      (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients and GPs have different perceptions of the efficacy of
      diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. GPs should explore the patients
      expectations and incorporate these in their approach to IBS patients.

TI  - Incidence of colonic ischemia, hospitalized complications of constipation, and
      bowel surgery in relation to use of alosetron hydrochloride.
PG  - 1117-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex), a potent selective
      5-hydroxytryptamine(3) receptor antagonist, was approved in February, 2000 in the
      United States for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS) in women. Marketing was suspended in November, 2000, after reports of
      colonic ischemia and serious complications of constipation. We sought to compare 
      the incidence of colonic ischemia, hospitalized complications of constipation,
      and bowel surgery among alosetron users and a cohort of patients with IBS who did
      not use alosetron. METHODS: We sought outcomes of colonic ischemia, hospitalized 
      complications of constipation, and bowel surgery in 3,631 Lotronex users and
      2,480 comparison IBS subjects using diagnoses, procedures, and drugs recorded in 
      the UnitedHealthcare insurance claims database, and validated these by chart
      review. The initial assessment was to last for 3 yr beginning with the start of
      alosetron treatment and was to include 10,000 Lotronex users; however, the
      observation period ended by December 31, 2000, after suspension of marketing.
      RESULTS: There were 3631 alosetron users among members of UnitedHealthcare from
      March through December, 2000, and we identified 2480 comparison IBS-only
      patients; follow-up time averaged about 5 months in both groups. There were no
      instances of colonic ischemia in either cohort. Thirty instances of bowel surgery
      occurred, giving rates of 10.2/1000 person-yr in the alosetron cohort and
      11.8/1000 person-yr in the IBS/no alosetron cohort. There were three cases of
      hospitalized complications of constipation. The incidence rates were essentially 
      the same in alosetron users (1.24/1000 person-yr) and in IBS patients with no
      alosetron use (0.92/1000 person-yr). CONCLUSIONS: Alosetron users did not differ 
      from IBS patients not using alosetron in the incidence of bowel surgery or
      hospitalized complications of constipation; there were no cases of colonic
      ischemia. The statistical upper limit of colonic ischemia rates in alosetron
      users was 2.28/1000 person-yr. Because of the market withdrawal, the size of the 
      cohort and the duration of follow-up were smaller than originally planned;
      consequently, the statements about the safety of alosetron were necessarily
      limited. On June 7, 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved alosetron for
      reintroduction in the U.S. market for women with severe diarrhea-related IBS.

TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome more likely to be persistent in those with relatives 
      who suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms? A population-based study at three time
      points.
PG  - 1389-97
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that subjects with relatives who suffered
      from abdominal pain or bowel dysfunction would be at an increased risk of more
      persistent irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A valid, self-report questionnaire 
      was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of residents, aged
      30-64 years, in Olmsted County, MN, USA, on three occasions over a 4-year period.
      Persistent irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the presence of irritable
      bowel syndrome on at least two of the three surveys, and fluctuating irritable
      bowel syndrome was defined as the presence of irritable bowel syndrome on only
      one of the surveys. RESULTS: Subjects were less likely to have persistent
      irritable bowel syndrome over the age of 50 years [odds ratio (OR), 0.20; 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 0.09, 0.47]. A positive family history was reported by 
      23%. A family history of gastrointestinal symptoms was independently associated
      with persistent irritable bowel syndrome (vs. no irritable bowel syndrome: OR,
      2.5; 95% CI, 1.3, 4.9) and fluctuating irritable bowel syndrome (vs. no irritable
      bowel syndrome: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3, 4.4). However, subjects reporting a
      positive family history were not more likely to report persistent vs. fluctuating
      irritable bowel syndrome (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5, 2.9). The use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2, 4.3) and a history of food
      sensitivity (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9, 6.9) were the only other predictors of
      persistent irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: A history of abdominal pain or 
      bowel troubles in first-degree relatives appears to be independently associated
      with both persistent and fluctuating irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Partially hydrolyzed guar gum: clinical nutrition uses.
PG  - 549-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a review of research on partially hydrolyzed guar 
      gum that is relevant to clinical nutrition practice. METHODS: All relevant papers
      published on partially hydrolyzed guar gum were reviewed and the results
      summarized. RESULTS: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble
      dietary fiber with a wide range of uses in clinical nutrition. Its low viscosity 
      allows its use in enteral products and beverages. PHGG can be added to enteral
      formulas and food products as a dietary fiber source. PHGG provides the benefits 
      associated with dietary fiber ingestion. Addition of PHGG to the diet reduced
      laxative dependence in a nursing home population. PHGG also reduced the incidence
      of diarrhea in septic patients receiving total enteral nutrition and reduced
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. PHGG also increased production of
      Bifidobacterium in the gut. CONCLUSION: The ease of use of PHGG and its clinical 
      effectiveness make it a good choice in clinical nutrition practice.

      Furthermore, recent preliminary data suggest that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
      concentration in platelet poor plasma is elevated following meal ingestion in
      some subjects with diarrhoea predominant IBS (d-IBS) compared with healthy
      subjects, although it is not known whether this is related to postprandial
      symptomatology. AIM: To expand on previous data by evaluating a larger number of 
      subjects but also to assess plasma 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)
      concentrations, 5-HT turnover, platelet 5-HT stores, and any relationship to
      symptomatology. METHODS: We assessed platelet depleted plasma 5-HT and 5-HIAA
      concentrations for two hours (60 minute intervals) under fasting conditions, and 
      then for a further four hours (30 minute intervals) after a standard carbohydrate
      meal (457 kcal), together with fasting platelet 5-HT concentrations in 39 female 
      subjects with d-IBS (aged 19-52 years; mean age 33) and 20 healthy female
      volunteers (aged 20-46 years, mean age 28). IBS symptomatology, in particular
      abdominal pain and bloating, and urgency to defecate were assessed throughout the
      study RESULTS: When related to fasting levels, there was no statistically
      significant difference in postprandial plasma 5-HT concentrations between d-IBS
      and healthy subjects. However, when fasting levels were not taken into
      consideration, d-IBS subjects exhibited higher postprandial plasma 5-HT
      concentrations compared with healthy subjects (p=0.040). Furthermore, d-IBS
      subjects who exhibited postprandial symptomatology had higher levels of
      postprandial plasma 5-HT, whether assessed with respect to fasting baseline
      levels (p=0.069) or not (p=0.047), compared with d-IBS subjects who did not
      report postprandial symptomatology. This appeared to be associated with a
      concomitant increase in plasma 5-HIAA (p=0.161) but reduction in turnover
      (p=0.058). Lastly, d-IBS subjects had higher platelet concentrations of 5-HT than
      healthy subjects (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that postprandial
      symptomatology may be associated with increased platelet depleted plasma 5-HT
      concentrations in female subjects with d-IBS. In addition, the presence of
      increased platelet stores of 5-HT may act as a useful marker for the diagnosis
      and management of d-IBS.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a probiotic, VSL#3, on gut transit and symptoms 
      in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 895-904
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of a probiotic formulation, VSL#3, on
      gastrointestinal transit and symptoms of patients with Rome II irritable bowel
      syndrome with predominant diarrhoea. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with
      diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome were randomly assigned to receive 
      VSL#3 powder (450 billion lyophilized bacteria/day) or matching placebo twice
      daily for 8 weeks after a 2-week run-in period. Pre- and post-treatment
      gastrointestinal transit measurements were performed in all patients. Patients
      recorded their bowel function and symptoms daily in a diary during the 10-week
      study, which was powered to detect a 50% change in the primary colonic transit
      end-point. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean
      gastrointestinal transit measurements, bowel function scores or satisfactory
      global symptom relief between the two treatment groups, pre- or post-therapy.
      Differences in abdominal bloating scores between treatments were borderline
      significant (P = 0.09, analysis of covariance). Further analysis revealed that
      abdominal bloating was reduced (P = 0.046) with VSL#3 [mean post- minus
      pre-treatment score, - 13.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), - 2.5 to - 24.9], but 
      not with placebo (P = 0.54) (mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 1.7; 95% CI,
      7.1 to - 10.4). With the exception of changes in abdominal bloating, VSL#3 had no
      effect on other individual symptoms: abdominal pain, gas and urgency. All
      patients tolerated VSL#3 well. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 appears to be promising in the
      relief of abdominal bloating in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome. This is unrelated to an alteration in gastrointestinal or colonic
      transit.

TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in patients presenting with bacterial
      gastroenteritis? A community-based, case-control study.
PG  - 327-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been reported to follow infectious 
      diarrhea. Food-borne infections affect 76 million people in the United States and
      9.4 million in England per year; of these, only a small percentage of patients
      see their doctor, and even fewer will have stool culture confirmation. We
      hypothesized that patients who present to their doctor with gastroenteritis and
      have positive stool samples may be different from the normal population with
      regard to their pre-existing bowel symptoms. Our aim was to determine if patients
      with bacterial gastroenteritis were more likely to have prior IBS, functional
      dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea, compared with a control population. METHODS:
      Between January, 2000 and January, 2001, subjects with stool positive bacterial
      gastroenteritis and control subjects from the same primary care practice were
      invited to participate. The main outcome measure was the presence of IBS,
      functional dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea diagnosed using self-report Rome II 
      modular questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 217 people with recent bacterial
      gastroenteritis and 265 community controls consented to participate in the study.
      Of these, 89/217 cases and 46/265 controls had one of the functional GI disorders
      (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 2.17-5.00). IBS was present in 67 cases (31%) and 26 controls
      (10%) (OR = 4.1; 95% CI = 2.49-6.72). There was no statistically significant
      difference in the presence of prior functional dyspepsia or functional diarrhea. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IBS is more frequent before diagnosis in people with bacterial
      gastroenteritis presenting to their primary care physician than in community
      controls. Studies that examine the rate of IBS after bacterial gastroenteritis
      need to carefully exclude people with prior IBS in a systematic way.

TI  - A systematic review of alternative therapies in the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder associated with a significant
      burden of illness, poor quality of life, high rates of absenteeism, and high
      health care utilization. Management can be difficult and treatment unrewarding;
      these facts have led physicians and patients toward alternative therapies. We
      explored a variety of treatments that exist beyond the scope of commonly used
      therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Guarded optimism exists for traditional
      Chinese medicine and psychological therapies, but further well-designed trials
      are needed. Oral cromolyn sodium may be useful in chronic unexplained diarrhea
      and appears as effective as and safer than elimination diets. The roles of
      lactose and fructose intolerance remain poorly understood. Alterations of enteric
      flora may play a role in irritable bowel syndrome, but supporting evidence for
      bacterial overgrowth or probiotic therapy is lacking.

TI  - Systematic review of treatments for recurrent abdominal pain.
PG  - e1-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evaluated treatments for recurrent
      abdominal pain (RAP) in children. METHODS: Online bibliographic databases were
      searched for the terms "recurrent abdominal pain," "functional abdominal pain,"
      "children," or "alternative therapies" in articles classified as randomized
      controlled trials. The abstracts or full text of 57 relevant articles were
      examined; 10 of these met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria required that
      the study involve children aged 5 to 18 years, subjects have a diagnosis of RAP, 
      and that subjects were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. The
      methodology and findings of these articles were evaluated critically, and data
      were extracted from each article regarding study methods, specific interventions,
      outcomes measured, and results. RESULTS: Studies that evaluated famotidine,
      pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and peppermint oil
      enteric-coated capsules showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes for those who
      received the interventions when compared with others in control groups. The
      studies that evaluated dietary interventions had conflicting results, in the case
      of fiber, or showed no efficacy, in the case of lactose avoidance. CONCLUSIONS:
      Evidence for efficacy of treatment of RAP in children was found for therapies
      that used famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and
      peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules. The effects of dietary fiber were less
      conclusive, and the use of a lactose-free diet showed no improvement. There
      seemed to be greater improvement when therapy (famotidine, pizotifen, peppermint 
      oil) was targeted to the specific functional gastrointestinal disorder
      (dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, irritable bowel syndrome). The behavioral
      interventions seemed to have a general positive effect on children with
      nonspecific RAP. Many of these therapies have not been used widely as standard
      treatment for children with RAP. Although the mechanism of action for each
      effective therapy is not fully understood, each is believed to be safe for use in
      RAP.
