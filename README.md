# Machine Learning Ananlysis

# Data Set

 endoscopic and histological data were collected from 287 patients 
178 patients with Crohnâ€™s disease (CD), 
80 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
29 patients with inflammatory bowel disease unclassified(IBDU)
Validation data (35 CD and 13 UC)

# Unsupervised Learning

here we use Principal component analysis (PCA)
firt with 3 componet  then with 2 componets

# Supervised Learning

we use the PCA with 2 componets as new kind of feature
this hel to clean noise but many for ploting in 2D
how the algoirthms perform the casification:
*linear kernel 
*Multi Layer Perceptron with 50 Hidden_layes
*SVC with RBF kernel
*SVC with polynomial^5

the we use a Ensemble Methods of Soft Voting 
with the algoritms :
*k-nearest neighbors (k=4)
*GaussianProcess
* SVM poly5

# future work

it will be recomendt an exploratory anlysis of Neural Network with other arquitecures
as weel Sport Vector machine with RBF kernel withan optimization of parameter C & gamma
